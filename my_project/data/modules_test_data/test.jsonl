The major feature is that, by making use of the characteristics of the NAND flash channel, the proposed algorithm performs the message pre-processing (MP) scheme to effectively prevent the propagation of unreliable messages and speed up the propagation of reliable messages. To further speed up the decoding convergence, the treatment for oscillating variable nodes (VNs) is considered after the MP scheme being employed. Simulation results show that the proposed VNBP-MP algorithm has a noticeable improvement in convergence speed without compromising the error-correction performance, compared with the existing algorithms."}

However, the PF algorithm needs a large number of samples to approximate the posterior probability density of the system, which makes the algorithm complex. What's more, the judgment of resampling is imperfect. Based on this, an improved PF algorithm which introducing population diversity factor and genetic algorithm into the process of re-sampling is proposed in this paper. The effective sample size and the population diversity factor are used to determine whether to re-sampling. When re-sampling is needed, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the particle set. The simulation result shows that estimation accuracy of the improved algorithm is better than that of traditional particles filter, not only in accuracy, but also in efficiency."}

Therefore, the study of vertical handover related algorithms is the key to the success of various wireless access networks in the future. This paper proposes an optimized algorithm which combines two multiple attribute decision making (MADM) methods, the Entropy and the improved Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The Entropy method is applied to obtain objective weights and the improved TOPSIS method is used to rank the alternatives. The simulation results show that the proposed technique can make the distribution of weights more reasonable, and effectively reduce the number of handoffs."}

In this paper, a data-driven approach to SSL using TDOA measurements is considered. A neural network (NN) is viewed as an architecture constrained non-linear function, with its parameters learnt from the training data. We consider a three layer neural network with TDOA measurements between pairs of microphones as input features and source location in the Cartesian coordinate system as output. Experimentally, we show that, NN trained even on noise-less TDOA measurements can achieve good performance for noisy TDOA inputs also. These performances are better than the traditional spherical interpolation (SI) method. We show that the NN trained offline using simulated TDOA measurements, performs better than the SI method, on real-life speech signals in a simulated enclosure."}

The past values of both the state and the received symbols are strictly causally made available to the encoders at each instant. The capacity region for the noiseless case, without any feedback, was recently solved in literature. Here we study the model with noise as well as feedback. We propose a communication scheme which effectively utilizes the feedback symbols as well as the state information to enhance the achievable region. In particular, Wyner-Ziv binning on the state information and Ozarow feedback scheme for the MAC are effectively utilized, using a suitable interleaving technique. The obtained region is significantly better than the feedback capacity region with no state information."}

In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to identify phishing attacks. It incorporates two components: an autoencoder (AE) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The AE is adopted to reconstruct features that enhances correlation relationship among the features explicitly. The results from the experiments show that the model is able to detect phishing attacks with a mean accuracy over 97.68%, yet it has high generalization ability and can detect phishing attacks in the receivable time scale."}

Therefore, an effective detection algorithm is demanded to detect these social bot accounts that endanger social networks. In this paper, a social bots detection model based on deep learning algorithm (DeBD) is proposed. The model mainly includes three layers. The first layer is the joint content feature extraction layer, which focuses on the feature extraction of the tweets content and the relationship between them. The second layer is the tweet metadata temporal feature extraction layer, which regards the tweet metadata as temporal information and uses this temporal information as the input of the LSTM to extract the user social activity temporal feature. The third layer is the feature fusing layer, which fuses the extracted joint content features with the temporal features to detect social bots. To evaluate the effectiveness of the DeBD model, we conducted experiments on three different types of new social bot data sets from the real world and the experiment results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."}

To achieve efficient transmission, we introduce network coding (NC) into VLC system and we develop two energy-efficient NC-based strategies, namely straightforward network coding over finite-alphabet sets (SNCF) scheme and physical-layer network coding over finite-alphabet sets (PNCF) scheme, which need three time slots and two time slots respectively to achieve the communication. Simulation results indicate that our proposed SNCF scheme and PNCF scheme both can achieve great performance gains over the traditional four time-slot transmission scheme."}

We formulate the cooperation between the cellular user equipment (CUE) and the D2D user equipment (DUE), the completion between legitimate users and the AE to be a secrecy anti-jamming game. In the proposed game framework, DUE launches the cooperative relaying or the friendly jamming mode to help CUE to improve its anti-eavesdropping and anti-jamming performance. CUE gives different-level rewards for the assistance of the DUE. And AE shifts its attacking modes between actively jamming and passively eavesdropping to maximize the destruction for the D2D underlaying cellular networks. Under the perfect information, we prove the existence of the pure-strategy equilibrium of the proposed game. Under the imperfect information, we analyze the existence of the mixed-strategy equilibrium of the proposed game and propose a distributed Q-Iearning-based algorithm to converge to a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is convergent and verify that average utilities of legitimate users are improved by the cooperation between CUE and DUE."}
