        "original": "To solve the problems of the data reliability for NAND flash storages, a variable-node-based belief-propagation with message pre-processing (VNBP-MP) decoding algorithm for binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed. The major feature is that, by making use of the characteristics of the NAND flash channel, the proposed algorithm performs the message pre-processing (MP) scheme to effectively prevent the propagation of unreliable messages and speed up the propagation of reliable messages. To further speed up the decoding convergence, the treatment for oscillating variable nodes (VNs) is considered after the MP scheme being employed. Simulation results show that the proposed VNBP-MP algorithm has a noticeable improvement in convergence speed without compromising the error-correction performance, compared with the existing algorithms.",
