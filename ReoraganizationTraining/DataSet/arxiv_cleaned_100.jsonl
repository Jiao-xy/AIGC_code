{"article": "additive models provide an important family of models for semiparametric regression or classification . some reasons for the success of additive models are their increased flexibility when compared to linear or generalized linear models and their increased interpretability when compared to fully nonparametric models . it is well - known that good estimators in additive models are in general less prone to the curse of high dimensionality than good estimators in fully nonparametric models . many examples of such estimators belong to the large class of regularized kernel based methods over a reproducing kernel hilbert space , see e.g. . in the last years many interesting results on learning rates of regularized kernel based models for additive models have been published when the focus is on sparsity and when the classical least squares loss function is used , see e.g. , , , , , and the references therein . of course , the least squares loss function is differentiable and has many nice mathematical properties , but it is only locally lipschitz continuous and therefore regularized kernel based methods based on this loss function typically suffer on bad statistical robustness properties , even if the kernel is bounded . this is in sharp contrast to kernel methods based on a lipschitz continuous loss function and on a bounded loss function , where results on upper bounds for the maxbias bias and on a bounded influence function are known , see e.g. for the general case and for additive models . therefore , we will here consider the case of regularized kernel based methods based on a general convex and lipschitz continuous loss function , on a general kernel , and on the classical regularizing term for some which is a smoothness penalty but not a sparsity penalty , see e.g. . such regularized kernel based methods are now often called support vector machines ( svms ) , although the notation was historically used for such methods based on the special hinge loss function and for special kernels only , we refer to . in this paper we address the open question , whether an svm with an additive kernel can provide a substantially better learning rate in high dimensions than an svm with a general kernel , say a classical gaussian rbf kernel , if the assumption of an additive model is satisfied . our leading example covers learning rates for quantile regression based on the lipschitz continuous but non - differentiable pinball loss function , which is also called check function in the literature , see e.g. and for parametric quantile regression and , , and for kernel based quantile regression . we will not address the question how to check whether the assumption of an additive model is satisfied because this would be a topic of a paper of its own . of course , a practical approach might be to fit both models and compare their risks evaluated for test data . for the same reason we will also not cover sparsity . consistency of support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models was considered in . in this paper we establish learning rates for these algorithms . let us recall the framework with a complete separable metric space as the input space and a closed subset of as the output space . a borel probability measure on is used to model the learning problem and an independent and identically distributed sample is drawn according to for learning . a loss function is used to measure the quality of a prediction function by the local error . throughout the paper we assume that is measurable , , convex with respect to the third variable , and uniformly lipschitz continuous satisfying with a finite constant . support vector machines ( svms ) considered here are kernel - based regularization schemes in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) generated by a mercer kernel . with a shifted loss function introduced for dealing even with heavy - tailed distributions as , they take the form where for a general borel measure on , the function is defined by where is a regularization parameter . the idea to shift a loss function has a long history , see e.g. in the context of m - estimators . it was shown in that is also a minimizer of the following optimization problem involving the original loss function if a minimizer exists : the additive model we consider consists of the input space decomposition with each a complete separable metric space and a hypothesis space where is a set of functions each of which is also identified as a map from to . hence the functions from take the additive form . we mention , that there is strictly speaking a notational problem here , because in the previous formula each quantity is an element of the set which is a subset of the full input space , , whereas in the definition of sample each quantity is an element of the full input space , where . because these notations will only be used in different places and because we do not expect any misunderstandings , we think this notation is easier and more intuitive than specifying these quantities with different symbols . the additive kernel is defined in terms of mercer kernels on as it generates an rkhs which can be written in terms of the rkhs generated by on corresponding to the form  as with norm given by the norm of satisfies to illustrate advantages of additive models , we provide two examples of comparing additive with product kernels . the first example deals with gaussian rbf kernels . all proofs will be given in section . let , ] let and .\\ ] ] the additive kernel is given by furthermore , the product kernel is the standard gaussian kernel given by define a gaussian function on ^ 2 ] and ^s. ] . if we take all the mercer kernels to be , then ] , consisting of all square integrable functions whose partial derivatives are all square integrable , contains discontinuous functions and is not an rkhs . denote the marginal distribution of on as . under the assumption that for each and that is dense in in the -metric , it was proved in that in probability as long as satisfies and . the rest of the paper has the following structure . section contains our main results on learning rates for svms based on additive kernels . learning rates for quantile regression are treated as important special cases . section contains a comparison of our results with other learning rates published recently . section contains all the proofs and some results which can be interesting in their own . in this paper we provide some learning rates for the support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models which helps improve the quantitative understanding presented in . the rates are about asymptotic behaviors of the excess risk and take the form with . they will be stated under three kinds of conditions involving the hypothesis space , the measure , the loss , and the choice of the regularization parameter . the first condition is about the approximation ability of the hypothesis space . since the output function is from the hypothesis space , the learning rates of the learning algorithm depend on the approximation ability of the hypothesis space with respect to the optimal risk measured by the following approximation error . the approximation error of the triple is defined as to estimate the approximation error , we make an assumption about the minimizer of the risk for each , define the integral operator associated with the kernel by we mention that is a compact and positive operator on . hence we can find its normalized eigenpairs such that is an orthonormal basis of and as . fix . then we can define the -th power of by this is a positive and bounded operator and its range is well - defined . the assumption means lies in this range . we assume and where for some and each , is a function of the form with some . the case of assumption means each lies in the rkhs . a standard condition in the literature ( e.g. , ) for achieving decays of the form for the approximation error  is with some . here the operator is defined by in general , this can not be written in an additive form . however , the hypothesis space  takes an additive form . so it is natural for us to impose an additive expression for the target function with the component functions satisfying the power condition . the above natural assumption leads to a technical difficulty in estimating the approximation error : the function has no direct connection to the marginal distribution projected onto , hence existing methods in the literature ( e.g. , ) can not be applied directly . note that on the product space , there is no natural probability measure projected from , and the risk on is not defined . our idea to overcome the difficulty is to introduce an intermediate function . it may not minimize a risk ( which is not even defined ) . however , it approximates the component function well . when we add up such functions , we get a good approximation of the target function , and thereby a good estimate of the approximation error . this is the first novelty of the paper . under assumption , we have where is the constant given by the second condition for our learning rates is about the capacity of the hypothesis space measured by -empirical covering numbers . let be a set of functions on and for every the * covering number of * with respect to the empirical metric , given by is defined as and the * -empirical covering number * of is defined as we assume and that for some , and every , the -empirical covering number of the unit ball of satisfies the second novelty of this paper is to observe that the additive nature of the hypothesis space yields the following nice bound with a dimension - independent power exponent for the covering numbers of the balls of the hypothesis space , to be proved in section . under assumption , for any and , we have the bound for the covering numbers stated in theorem is special : the power is independent of the number of the components in the additive model . it is well -

{"article": "the leptonic decays of a charged pseudoscalar meson are processes of the type , where , , or . because no strong interactions are present in the leptonic final state , such decays provide a clean way to probe the complex , strong interactions that bind the quark and antiquark within the initial - state meson . in these decays , strong interaction effects can be parametrized by a single quantity , , the pseudoscalar meson decay constant . the leptonic decay rate can be measured by experiment , and the decay constant can be determined by the equation ( ignoring radiative corrections ) where is the fermi coupling constant , is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element , is the mass of the meson , and is the mass of the charged lepton . the quantity describes the amplitude for the and -quarks within the to have zero separation , a condition necessary for them to annihilate into the virtual boson that produces the pair . the experimental determination of decay constants is one of the most important tests of calculations involving nonperturbative qcd . such calculations have been performed using various models or using lattice qcd ( lqcd ) . the latter is now generally considered to be the most reliable way to calculate the quantity . knowledge of decay constants is important for describing several key processes , such as mixing , which depends on , a quantity that is also predicted by lqcd calculations . experimental determination of with the leptonic decay of a meson is , however , very limited as the rate is highly suppressed due to the smallness of the magnitude of the relevant ckm matrix element . the charm mesons , and , are better instruments to study the leptonic decays of heavy mesons since these decays are either less ckm suppressed or favored , i.e. , and are much larger than . thus , the decay constants and determined from charm meson decays can be used to test and validate the necessary lqcd calculations applicable to the -meson sector . among the leptonic decays in the charm - quark sector , decays are more accessible since they are ckm favored . furthermore , the large mass of the lepton removes the helicity suppression that is present in the decays to lighter leptons . the existence of multiple neutrinos in the final state , however , makes measurement of this decay challenging . physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) might also affect leptonic decays of charmed mesons . depending on the non - sm features , the ratio of could be affected , as could the ratio . any of the individual widths might be increased or decreased . there is an indication of a discrepancy between the experimental determinations of and the most recent precision lqcd calculation . this disagreement is particularly puzzling since the cleo - c determination of agrees well with the lqcd calculation of that quantity . some conjecture that this discrepancy may be explained by a charged higgs boson or a leptoquark . in this article , we report an improved measurement of the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay ( charge - conjugate modes are implied ) , with , from which we determine the decay constant . we use a data sample of events provided by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and collected by the cleo - c detector at the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy mev , near peak production . the data sample consists of an integrated luminosity of containing pairs . we have previously reported measurements of and with a subsample of these data . a companion article reports measurements of from and , with , using essentially the same data sample as the one used in this measurement . the cleo - c detector is a general - purpose solenoidal detector with four concentric components utilized in this measurement : a small - radius six - layer stereo wire drift chamber , a 47-layer main drift chamber , a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , and an electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 7800 csi(tl ) crystals . the two drift chambers operate in a t magnetic field and provide charged particle tracking in a solid angle of % of . the chambers achieve a momentum resolution of % at gev/ . the main drift chamber also provides specific - ionization  measurements that discriminate between charged pions and kaons . the rich detector covers approximately % of and provides additional separation of pions and kaons at high momentum . the photon energy resolution of the calorimeter is % at gev and % at mev . electron identification is based on a likelihood variable that combines the information from the rich detector , , and the ratio of electromagnetic shower energy to track momentum  . we use a geant - based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation program to study efficiency of signal - event selection and background processes . physics events are generated by evtgen , tuned with much improved knowledge of charm decays , and final - state radiation ( fsr ) is modeled by the photos program . the modeling of initial - state radiation ( isr ) is based on cross sections for production at lower energies obtained from the cleo - c energy scan near the cm energy where we collect the sample . the presence of two mesons in a event allows us to define a single - tag ( st ) sample in which a is reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode and a further double - tagged ( dt ) subsample in which an additional is required as a signature of decay , the being the daughter of the . the reconstructed in the st sample can be either primary or secondary from ( or ) . the st yield can be expressed as where is the produced number of pairs , is the branching fraction of hadronic modes used in the st sample , and is the st efficiency . the counts the candidates , not events , and the factor of 2 comes from the sum of and tags . our double - tag ( dt ) sample is formed from events with only a single charged track , identified as an , in addition to a st . the yield can be expressed as where is the leptonic decay branching fraction , including the subbranching fraction of decay , is the efficiency of finding the st and the leptonic decay in the same event . from the st and dt yields we can obtain an absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay , without needing to know the integrated luminosity or the produced number of pairs , where  is the effective signal efficiency . because of the large solid angle acceptance with high segmentation of the cleo - c detector and the low multiplicity of the events with which we are concerned , , where is the leptonic decay efficiency . hence , the ratio is insensitive to most systematic effects associated with the st , and the signal branching fraction obtained using this procedure is nearly independent of the efficiency of the tagging mode . to minimize systematic uncertainties , we tag using three two - body hadronic decay modes with only charged particles in the final state . the three st modes and are shorthand labels for events within mass windows ( described below ) of the peak in and the peak in , respectively . no attempt is made to separate these resonance components in the dalitz plot . ] are , , and . using these tag modes also helps to reduce the tag bias which would be caused by the correlation between the tag side and the signal side reconstruction if tag modes with high multiplicity and large background were used . the effect of the tag bias can be expressed in terms of the signal efficiency defined by where is the st efficiency when the recoiling system is the signal leptonic decay with single in the other side of the tag . as the general st efficiency , when the recoiling system is any possible decays , will be lower than the , sizable tag bias could be introduced if the multiplicity of the tag mode were high , or the tag mode were to include neutral particles in the final state . as shown in sec . , this effect is negligible in our chosen clean tag modes . the decay is reconstructed by combining oppositely charged tracks that originate from a common vertex and that have an invariant mass within mev of the nominal mass . we require the resonance decay to satisfy the following mass windows around the nominal masses : ( mev ) and ( mev ) . we require the momenta of charged particles to be mev or greater to suppress the slow pion background from decays ( through ) . we identify a st by using the invariant mass of the tag and recoil mass against the tag . the recoil mass is defined as where is the net four - momentum of the beam , taking the finite beam crossing angle into account ; is the four - momentum of the tag , with computed from and the nominal mass of the meson . we require the recoil mass to be within mev of the mass . this loose window allows both primary and secondary tags to be selected . to estimate the backgrounds in our st and dt yields from the wrong tag combinations ( incorrect combinations that , by chance , lie within the signal region ) , we use the tag invariant mass sidebands . we define the signal region as mev mev , and the sideband regions as mev mev or mev mev , where is the difference between the tag mass and the nominal mass . we fit the st distributions to the sum of double - gaussian signal function plus second - degree chebyshev polynomial background function to get the tag mass sideband scaling factor . the invariant mass distributions of tag candidates for each tag mode are shown in fig . and the st yield and sideband scaling factor are summarized in table . we find summed over the three tag modes . . summary of single - tag ( st ) yields , where is the yield in the st mass signal region , is the yield in the sideband region , is the sideband scaling factor , and is the scaled sideband - subtracted yield . we considered six semileptonic decays , , , , , , and , as the major sources of background in the signal region . the second dominates the nonpeaking background , and the fourth ( with ) dominates the peaking background . uncertainty in the signal yield due to nonpeaking background  is assessed by varying the semileptonic decay branching fractions by the precision with which they are known . imperfect knowledge of gives rise to a systematic uncertainty in our estimate of the amount of peaking background in the signal region , which has an effect on our branching fraction measurement of . we study differences in efficiency , data vs mc events , due to the extra energy requirement , extra track veto , and requirement , by using samples from data and mc events , in which both the and satisfy our tag requirements , i.e. , `` double - tag '' events . we then apply each of the above - mentioned requirements and compare loss in efficiency of data vs mc events . in this way we obtain a correction of for the extra energy requirement and systematic uncertainties on each of the three requirements of ( all equal , by chance ) . the non- background in the signal candidate sample is negligible  due to the low probability ( per track ) that hadrons ( or ) are misidentified as . uncertainty in these backgrounds produces a uncertainty in the measurement of . the secondary backgrounds from charge symmetric processes , such as dalitz decay  and conversion  , are assessed by measuring the wrong - sign signal electron in events with . the uncertainty in the measurement from this source is estimated to be . other possible sources of systematic uncertainty include  , tag bias  , tracking efficiency  , identification efficiency  , and fsr  . combining all contributions in quadrature , the total systematic uncertainty in the branching fraction measurement is estimated to be . in summary , using the sample of tagged decays with the cleo - c detector we obtain the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay through where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic . this result supersedes our previous measurement of the same branching fraction , which used a subsample of data used in this work . the decay constant can be computed using eq .  with known values gev , mev , mev , and s. we assume and use the value given in ref . we obtain combining with our other determination of mev with and  decays , we obtain this result is derived from absolute branching fractions only and is the most precise determination of the leptonic decay constant to date . our combined result is larger than the recent lqcd calculation mev by standard deviations . the difference between data and lqcd for could be due to physics beyond the sm , unlikely statistical fluctuations in the experimental measurements or the lqcd calculation , or systematic uncertainties that are not understood in the lqcd calculation or the experimental measurements . combining with our other determination of , via , we obtain using this with our measurement of , we obtain the branching fraction ratio this is consistent with , the value predicted by the sm with lepton universality , as given in eq .  with known masses . we gratefully acknowledge the effort of the cesr staff in providing us with excellent luminosity and running conditions . d. cronin -

{"article": "the transport properties of nonlinear non - equilibrium dynamical systems are far from well - understood . consider in particular so - called ratchet systems which are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport . the origins of the interest in this lie in considerations about extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations as seems to happen in biological systems . recently attention has been focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets as well as hamiltonian ratchets . chaotic systems are defined as those which are sensitively dependent on initial conditions . whether chaotic or not , the behavior of nonlinear systems including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior is in general sensitively dependent on the parameters of the system . that is , the phase - space structure is usually relatively complicated , consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas , for examples , or of simultaneously co - existing attractors . this can change significantly as parameters change . for example , stability islands can merge into each other , or break apart , and the chaotic sea itself may get pinched off or otherwise changed , or attractors can change symmetry or bifurcate . this means that the transport properties can change dramatically as well . a few years ago , mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle . he looked at an ensemble of particles , specifically the velocity for the particles , averaged over time and the entire ensemble . he showed that this quantity , which is an intuitively reasonable definition of ` the current ' , could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing for the system . at the same time , there exist ranges in where the trajectory of an individual particle displays chaotic dynamics . mateos conjectured a connection between these two phenomena , specifically that the reversal of current direction was correlated with a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics . even though it is unlikely that such a result would be universally valid across all chaotic deterministic ratchets , it would still be extremely useful to have general heuristic rules such as this . these organizing principles would allow some handle on characterizing the many different kinds of behavior that are possible in such systems . a later investigation of the mateos conjecture by barbi and salerno , however , argued that it was not a valid rule even in the specific system considered by mateos . they presented results showing that it was possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior . they proposed an alternative origin for the current reversal , suggesting it was related to the different stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system . these latter results seem fundamentally sensible . however , this paper based its arguments about currents on the behavior of a single particle as opposed to an ensemble . this implicitly assumes that the dynamics of the system are ergodic . this is not true in general for chaotic systems of the type being considered . in particular , there can be extreme dependence of the result on the statistics of the ensemble being considered . this has been pointed out in earlier studies which laid out a detailed methodology for understanding transport properties in such a mixed regular and chaotic system . depending on specific parameter value , the particular system under consideration has multiple coexisting periodic or chaotic attractors or a mixture of both . it is hence appropriate to understand how a probability ensemble might behave in such a system . the details of the dependence on the ensemble are particularly relevant to the issue of the possible experimental validation of these results , since experiments are always conducted , by virtue of finite - precision , over finite time and finite ensembles . it is therefore interesting to probe the results of barbi and salerno with regard to the details of the ensemble used , and more formally , to see how ergodicity alters our considerations about the current , as we do in this paper . we report here on studies on the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet , specifically the same system as considered by mateos and barbi and salerno . we consider the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble . we also show that it is important to discard transients in quantifying the current . this is one of the central messages of this paper : broad heuristics are rare in chaotic systems , and hence it is critical to understand the ensemble - dependence in any study of the transport properties of chaotic ratchets . having established this , we then proceed to discuss the connection between the bifurcation diagram for individual particles and the behavior of the current . we find that while we disagree with many of the details of barbi and salerno s results , the broader conclusion still holds . that is , it is indeed possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from chaos to periodic behavior as well as bifurcations without any accompanying current reversals . the result of our investigation is therefore that the transport properties of a chaotic ratchet are not as simple as the initial conjecture . however , we do find evidence for a generalized version of mateos s conjecture . that is , in general , bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the current . depending on the specific value of the current , these abrupt changes may lead the net current to reverse direction , but not necessarily so . we start below with a preparatory discussion necessary to understand the details of the connection between bifurcations and current reversal , where we discuss the potential and phase - space for single trajectories for this system , where we also define a bifurcation diagram for this system . in the next section , we discuss the subtleties of establishing a connection between the behavior of individual trajectories and of ensembles . after this , we are able to compare details of specific trajectory bifurcation curves with current curves , and thus justify our broader statements above , after which we conclude . the goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets . the approach taken here is that to discover heuristic rules we must consider specific systems in great detail before generalizing . we choose the same -dimensional ratchet considered previously by mateos , as well as barbi and salerno . we consider an ensemble of particles moving in an asymmetric periodic potential , driven by a periodic time - dependent external force , where the force has a zero time - average . there is no noise in the system , so it is completely deterministic , although there is damping . the equations of motion for an individual trajectory for such a system are given in dimensionless variables by where the periodic asymmetric potential can be written in the form + {4 } \\sin \\bigg ] .\\ ] ] in this equation have been introduced for convenience such that one potential minimum exists at the origin with and the term . ( a ) classical phase space for the unperturbed system . for , , two chaotic attractors emerge with ( b ) ( c ) and a period four attractor consisting of the four centers of the circles with .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] the phase - space of the undamped undriven ratchet the system corresponding to the unperturbed potential looks like a series of asymmetric pendula . that is , individual trajectories have one of following possible time - asymptotic behaviors : ( i ) inside the potential wells , trajectories and all their properties oscillate , leading to zero net transport . outside the wells , the trajectories either ( ii ) librate to the right or ( iii ) to the left , with corresponding net transport depending upon initial conditions . there are also ( iv ) trajectories on the separatrices between the oscillating and librating orbits , moving between unstable fixed points in infinite time , as well as the unstable and stable fixed points themselves , all of which constitute a set of negligible measure . when damping is introduced via the -dependent term in eq . , it makes the stable fixed points the only attractors for the system . when the driving is turned on , the phase - space becomes chaotic with the usual phenomena of intertwining separatrices and resulting homoclinic tangles . the dynamics of individual trajectories in such a system are now very complicated in general and depend sensitively on the choice of parameters and initial conditions . we show snapshots of the development of this kind of chaos in the set of poincar sections fig . ( b , c ) together with a period - four orbit represented by the center of the circles . a broad characterization of the dynamics of the problem as a function of a parameter ( or ) emerges in a bifurcation diagram . this can be constructed in several different and essentially equivalent ways . the relatively standard form that we use proceeds as follows : first choose the bifurcation parameter ( let us say ) and correspondingly choose fixed values of , and start with a given value for . now iterate an initial condition , recording the value of the particle s position at times from its integrated trajectory ( sometimes we record . this is done stroboscopically at discrete times where and is an integer with the maximum number of observations made . of these , discard observations at times less than some cut - off time and plot the remaining points against . it must be noted that discarding transient behavior is critical to get results which are independent of initial condition , and we shall emphasize this further below in the context of the net transport or current . if the system has a fixed - point attractor then all of the data lie at one particular location . a periodic orbit with period ( that is , with period commensurate with the driving ) shows up with points occupying only different locations of for . all other orbits , including periodic orbits of incommensurate period result in a simply - connected or multiply - connected dense set of points . for the next value , the last computed value of at are used as initial conditions , and previously , results are stored after cutoff and so on until . that is , the bifurcation diagram is generated by sweeping the relevant parameter , in this case , from through some maximum value . this procedure is intended to catch all coexisting attractors of the system with the specified parameter range . note that several initial conditions are effectively used troughout the process , and a bifurcation diagram is not the behavior of a single trajectory . we have made several plots , as a test , with different initial conditions and the diagrams obtained are identical . we show several examples of this kind of bifurcation diagram below , where they are being compared with the corresponding behavior of the current . having broadly understood the wide range of behavior for individual trajectories in this system , we now turn in the next section to a discussion of the non - equilibrium properties of a statistical ensemble of these trajectories , specifically the current for an ensemble . the current for an ensemble in the system is defined in an intuitive manner by mateos as the time - average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions . that is , an average over several initial conditions is performed at a given observation time to yield the average velocity over the particles this average velocity is then further time - averaged ; given the discrete time for observation this leads to a second sum where is the number of time - observations made . for this to be a relevant quantity to compare with bifurcation diagrams , should be independent of the quantities but still strongly dependent on . a further parameter dependence that is being suppressed in the definition above is the shape and location of the ensemble being used . that is , the transport properties of an ensemble in a chaotic system depend in general on the part of the phase - space being sampled . it is therefore important to consider many different initial conditions to generate a current . the first straightforward result we show in fig .  is that in the case of chaotic trajectories , a single trajectory easily displays behavior very different from that of many trajectories . however , it turns out that in the regular regime , it is possible to use a single trajectory to get essentially the same result as obtained from many trajectories . further consider the bifurcation diagram in fig .  where we superimpose the different curves resulting from varying the number of points in the initial ensemble . first , the curve is significantly smoother as a function of for larger . even more relevant is the fact that the single trajectory data  may show current reversals that do not exist in the large data . current versus the number of trajectories for ; dashed lines correspond to a regular motion with while solid lines correspond to a chaotic motion with . note that a single trajectory is sufficient for a regular motion while the convergence in the chaotic case is only obtained if the exceeds a certain threshold , .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] current versus for different set of trajectories ; ( circles ) , ( square ) and ( dashed lines ) . note that a single trajectory suffices in the regular regime where all the curves match . in the chaotic regime , as increases , the curves converge towards the dashed one.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] also , note that single - trajectory current values are typically significantly greater than ensemble averages . this arises from the fact that an arbitrarily chosen ensemble has particles with idiosyncratic behaviors which often average out . as our result , with these ensembles we see typical for example , while barbi and salerno report currents about times greater . however , it is not true that only a few trajectories dominate the dynamics completely , else there would not be a saturation of the current as a function of . all this is clear in fig .  . we note that the * net * drift of an ensemble can be a lot closer to than the behavior of an individual trajectory . it should also be clear that there is a dependence of the current on the location of the initial ensemble , this being particularly true for small , of course . the location is defined by its centroid . for , it is trivially true that the initial location matters to the asymptotic value of the time - averaged velocity , given that this is a non - ergodic and chaotic system . further , considering a gaussian ensemble , say , the width of the ensemble also affects the details of the current , and can show , for instance , illusory current reversal , as seen in figs . ( , ) for example . notice also that in fig .  , at and , the deviations between the different ensembles is particularly pronounced . these points are close to bifurcation points where some sort of symmetry breaking is clearly occuring , which underlines our emphasis on the relevance of specifying ensemble characteristics in the neighborhood of unstable behavior . however , why these specific bifurcations should stand out among all the bifurcations in the parameter range shown is not entirely clear . to understand how to incorporate this knowledge into calculations of the current , therefore , consider the fact that if we look at the classical phase space for the hamiltonian or underdamped motion , we see the typical structure of stable islands embedded in a chaotic sea which have quite complicated behavior . in such a situation , the dynamics always depends on the location of the initial conditions . however , we are not in the hamiltonian situation when the damping is turned on in this case , the phase - space consists in general of attractors . that is , if transient behavior is discarded , the current is less likely to depend significantly on the location of the initial conditions or on the spread of the initial conditions . in particular , in the chaotic regime of a non - hamiltonian system , the initial ensemble needs to be chosen larger than a certain threshold to ensure convergence . however , in the regular regime , it is not important to take a large ensemble and a single trajectory can suffice , as long as we take care to discard the transients . that is to say , in the computation of currents , the definition of the current needs to be modified to : where is some empirically obtained cut - off such that we get a converged current ( for instance , in our calculations , we obtained converged results with ) . when this modified form is used , the convergence ( ensemble - independence ) is more rapid as a function of and the width of the intial conditions . armed with this background , we are now finally in a position to compare bifurcation diagrams with the current , as we do in the next section . our results are presented in the set of figures fig .  fig .  , in each of which we plot both the ensemble current and the bifurcation diagram as a function of the parameter . the main point of these numerical results can be distilled into a series of heuristic statements which we state below ; these are labelled with roman numerals . for and , we plot current ( upper ) with and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus . note that there is a * single * current reversal while there are many bifurcations visible in the same parameter range.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] consider fig .  , which shows the parameter range chosen relatively arbitrarily . in this figure , we see several period - doubling bifurcations leading to order - chaos transitions , such as for example in the approximate ranges . however , there is only one instance of current - reversal , at . note , however , that the current is not without structure it changes fairly dramatically as a function of parameter . this point is made even more clearly in fig .  where the current remains consistently below , and hence there are in fact , no current reversals at all . note again , however , that the current has considerable structure , even while remaining negative . for and , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus with . notice the current stays consistently below .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] current and bifurcations versus . in ( a ) and ( b ) we show ensemble dependence , specifically in ( a ) the black curve is for an ensemble of trajectories starting centered at the stable fixed point with a root - mean - square gaussian width of , and the brown curve for trajectories starting from the unstable fixed point and of width . in ( b ) , all ensembles are centered at the stable fixed point , the black line for an ensemble of width , brown a width of and maroon with width . ( c ) is the comparison of the current without transients ( black ) and with transients ( brown ) along with the single - trajectory results in blue ( after barbi and salerno ) . the initial conditions for the ensembles are centered at with a mean root square gaussian of width . ( d ) is the corresponding bifurcation diagram.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] it is possible to find several examples of this at different parameters , leading to the negative conclusion , therefore , that * ( i ) not all bifurcations lead to current reversal*. however , we are searching for positive correlations , and at this point we have not precluded the more restricted statement that all current reversals are associated with bifurcations , which is in fact mateos conjecture . we therefore now move onto comparing our results against the specific details of barbi and salerno s treatment of this conjecture . in particular , we look at their figs . ( 2,3a,3b ) , where they scan the parameter region . the distinction between their results and ours is that we are using ensembles of particles , and are investigating the convergence of these results as a function of number of particles , the width of the ensemble in phase - space , as well as transience parameters . our data with larger yields different results in general , as we show in the recomputed versions of these figures , presented here in figs . ( , ) . specifically , ( a ) the single - trajectory results are , not surprisingly , cleaner and can be more easily interpreted as part of transitions in the behavior of the stability properties of the periodic orbits . the ensemble results on the other hand , even when converged , show statistical roughness . ( b ) the ensemble results are consistent with barbi and salerno in general , although disagreeing in several details . for instance , ( c ) the bifurcation at has a much gentler impact on the ensemble current , which has been growing for a while , while the single - trajectory result changes abruptly . note , ( d ) the very interesting fact that the single - trajectory current completely misses the bifurcation - associated spike at . further , ( e ) the barbi and salerno discussion of the behavior of the current in the range is seen to be flawed our results are consistent with theirs , however , the current changes are seen to be consistent with bifurcations despite their statements to the contrary . on the other hand ( f ) , the ensemble current shows a case ) , at of current reversal that does not seem to be associated with bifurcations . in this spike , the current abruptly drops below and then rises above it again . the single trajectory current completely ignores this particular effect , as can be seen . the bifurcation diagram indicates that in this case the important transitions happen either before or after the spike . all of this adds up to two statements : the first is a reiteration of the fact that there is significant information in the ensemble current that can not be obtained from the single - trajectory current . the second is that the heuristic that arises from this is again a negative conclusion , that * ( ii ) not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations . * where does this leave us in the search for ` positive ' results , that is , useful heuristics ? one possible way of retaining the mateos conjecture is to weaken it , i.e. make it into the statement that * ( iii ) most current reversals are associated with bifurcations . * same as fig .  except for the range of considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] for and , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus with . note in particular in this figure that eyeball tests can be misleading . we see reversals without bifurcations in ( a ) whereas the zoomed version ( c ) shows that there are windows of periodic and chaotic regimes . this is further evidence that jumps in the current correspond in general to bifurcation.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] for and , current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] however , a * different * rule of thumb , previously not proposed , emerges from our studies . this generalizes mateos conjecture to say that * ( iv ) bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes ( spikes or jumps)*. note that this means these changes in current are not necessarily reversals of direction . if this current jump or spike goes through zero , this coincides with a current reversal , making the mateos conjecture a special case . the physical basis of this argument is the fact that ensembles of particles in chaotic systems can have net directed transport but the details of this behavior depends relatively sensitively on the system parameters . this parameter dependence is greatly exaggerated at the bifurcation point , when the dynamics of the underlying single - particle system undergoes a transition a period - doubling transition , for example , or one from chaos to regular behavior . scanning the relevant figures , we see that this is a very useful rule of thumb . for example , it completely captures the behaviour of fig .  which can not be understood as either an example of the mateos conjecture , or even a failure thereof . as such , this rule significantly enhances our ability to characterize changes in the behavior of the current as a function of parameter . a further example of where this modified conjecture helps us is in looking at a seeming negation of the mateos conjecture , that is , an example where we seem to see current - reversal without bifurcation , visible in fig .  . the current - reversals in that scan of parameter space seem to happen inside the chaotic regime and seemingly independent of bifurcation . however , this turns out to be a ` hidden ' bifurcation when we zoom in on the chaotic regime , we see hidden periodic windows . this is therefore consistent with our statement that sudden current changes are associated with bifurcations . each of the transitions from periodic behavior to chaos and back provides opportunities for the current to spike . however , in not all such cases can these hidden bifurcations be found . we can see an example of this in fig .  . the current is seen to move smoothly across with seemingly no corresponding bifurcations , even when we do a careful zoom on the data , as in fig .  . however , arguably , although subjective , this change is close to the bifurcation point . this result , that there are situations where the heuristics simply do not seem to apply , are part of the open questions associated with this problem , of course . we note , however , that we have seen that these broad arguments hold when we vary other parameters as well ( figures not shown here ) . in conclusion , in this paper we have taken the approach that it is useful to find general rules of thumb ( even if not universally valid ) to understand the complicated behavior of non - equilibrium nonlinear statistical mechanical systems . in the case of chaotic deterministic ratchets , we have shown that it is important to factor out issues of size , location , spread , and transience in computing the ` current ' due to an ensemble before we search for such rules , and that the dependence on ensemble characteristics is most critical near certain bifurcation points . we have then argued that the following heuristic characteristics hold : bifurcations in single - trajectory behavior often corresponds to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system . current reversals are a special case of this . however , not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation , nor vice versa . the open question is clearly to figure out if the reason for when these rules are violated or are valid can be made more concrete . a.k . gratefully acknowledges t. barsch and kamal p. singh for stimulating discussions , the reimar lst grant and financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation in bonn . a.k.p . is grateful to carleton college for the ` sit , wallin , and class of 1949 ' sabbatical fellowships , and to the mpipks for hosting him for a sabbatical visit , which led to this collaboration . useful discussions with j .- m . rost on preliminary results are also acknowledged . p. hnggi and bartussek , in nonlinear physics of complex systems , lecture notes in physics vol . 476 , edited by j. parisi , s.c . mueller , and w. zimmermann ( springer verlag , berlin , 1996 ) , pp.294 -

{"article": "studies of laser beams propagating through turbulent atmospheres are important for many applications such as remote sensing , tracking , and long - distance optical communications . howerver , fully coherent laser beams are very sensitive to fluctuations of the atmospheric refractive index . the initially coherent laser beam acquires some properties of gaussian statistics in course of its propagation through the turbulence . as a result , the noise / signal ratio approaches unity for long - distance propagation . ( see , for example , refs.- ) . this unfavourable effect limits the performance of communication channels . to mitigate this negative effect the use of partially ( spatially ) coherent beams was proposed . the coherent laser beam can be transformed into a partially coherent beam by means of a phase diffuser placed near the exit aperture . this diffuser introduces an additional phase ( randomly varying in space and time ) to the wave front of the outgoing radiation . statistical characteristics of the random phase determine the initial transverse coherence length of the beam . it is shown in refs . , that a considerable decrease in the noise / signal ratio can occur under following conditions : ( i ) the ratio of the initial transverse coherence length , , to the beam radius , , should be essentially smaller than unity ; and ( ii ) the characteristic time of phase variations , , should be much smaller than the integration time , , of the detector . however , only limiting cases and have been considered in the literature . ( see , for example , refs . , and ref . , respectively ) . it is evident that the inequality can be easily satisfied by choosing a detector with very long integration time . at the same time , this kind of the detector can not distinguish different signals within the interval . this means that the resolution of the receiving system might become too low for the case of large . on the other hand , there is a technical restriction on phase diffusers : up to now their characteristic times , , are not smaller than . besides that , in some specific cases ( see , for example , ref . ) , the spectral broadening of laser radiation due to the phase diffuser  may become unacceptably high . the factors mentioned above impose serious restrictions on the physical characteristics of phase diffusers which could be potentially useful for suppressing the intensity fluctuations . an adequate choice of diffusers may be facilitated if we know in detail the effect of finite - time phase variation , introduced by them , on the photon statistics . in this case , it is possible to control the performance of communication systems . in what follows , we will obtain theoretically the dependence of scintillation index on without any restrictions on the value of this ratio this is the main purpose of our paper . further analysis is based on the formalism developed in ref . and modified here to understand the case of finite - time dynamics of the phase diffuser . the detectors of the absorbed type do not sense the instantaneous intensity of electromagnetic waves . they sense the intensity averaged over some finite interval i.e. usually , the averaging time ( the integration time of the detector ) is much smaller than the characteristic time of the turbulence variation , ,  . therefore , the average value of the intensity can be obtained by further averaging of eq . over many measurements corresponding various realizations of the refractive - index configurations . the scintillation index determining the mean - square fluctuations of the intensity is defined by \\bigg /\\big < \\big > ^2= {\\big<\\bar i \\big>^2}-1,\\ ] ] where the symbol indicates the normal ordering of the creation and annihilation operators which determine the intensity , . ( see more details in refs . , ) . the brackets indicate quantum - mechanical and atmospheric averagings . the intensity depends not only on , but also on the spatial variable . therefore , the detected intensity is the intensity averaged not only over as in eq . , but also over the detector aperture . for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to calculations of the intensity correlations for coinciding spatial points that correspond to `` small '' detector aperture . this simplification is quite reasonable for a long - distance propagation path of the beam . in the case of quasimonochromatic light , we can choose in the form where and are the creation and annihilation operators of photons with momentum . they are given in the heisenberg representation . is the volume of the system . it follows from eqs . , that can be obtained if one knows the average it is a complex problem to obtain this value for arbitrary turbulence strengths and propagation distances . nevertheless , the following qualitative reasoning can help to do this in the case of strong turbulence . we have mentioned that the laser light acquires the properties of gaussian statistics in the course of its propagation through the turbulent atmosphere . as a result , in the limit of infinitely long propagation path , , only diagonal \" terms , i.e. terms with ( i ) or ( ii ) , contribute to the right part of eq . . for large but still finite , there exist small ranges of in case ( i ) and , in case ( ii ) contributing into the sum in eq . the presence of the mentioned regions is due to the two possible ways of correlating of four different waves ( see ref . ) which enter the right hand side of eq . . as explained in ref . , the characteristic sizes of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) depend on the atmospheric broadening of beam radii as , thus decreasing with increasing . in the case of long - distance propagation , is much smaller than the component of photon wave - vectors perpendicular to the axis . the last quantity grows with as . ( see ref . ) . for this reason , the overlapping of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be neglected . in this case eq . can be rewritten in the convenient form : where the value , confining summation over , is chosen to be greater than but much smaller than the characteristic transverse wave vector of the photons ; this is consistent with the above explanations . the two terms in the right - hand side correspond to the two regions of four - wave correlations . the quantity entering the right side of eq . is the operator of photon density in phase space ( the photon distribution function in space ) . it was used in refs . , and for the description of photon propagation in turbulent atmospheres . by analogy , we can define the two - time distribution function then eq . can be rewritten in terms of the distribution functions as let us represent in the form . we assume that , as explained in the text after eq. . in this case the hamiltonian of photons in a turbulent atmosphere can be considered to be independent of time . as a result , both functions defined by eqs . and satisfy the same kinetic equation , i.e. where is the photon velocity , is a random force , caused by the turbulence . this force is equal to , where is the frequency of laser radiation . is the refractive index of the atmosphere . the general solution of the equation for can be written in the form where the functions and obey the equations of motion with the boundary conditions . the instant is equal to , where is the speed of light . is the time of the exit of photons from the source . this choice of makes it possible to neglect the influence of the turbulence on the initial values of operators ( their dependence on time is as in vacuum ) . the term for can be obtained from eq . by putting . substituting both distribution functions into eq . , we obtain :\\big>,\\ ] ] where and are solutions of eqs . with the initial conditions and , respectively . the operators on the right side of eq . are related through matching conditions with the amplitudes of the exiting laser radiation ( see ref . ) by the relation where is the operator of the laser field which is assumed to be a single - mode field and the subscript  means perpendicular to the -axis component . the function describes the profile of the laser mode , which is assumed to be gaussian - type function . the quantity is the random phase introduced by the phase diffuser . a similar consideration is applicable to each of four photon operators entering both terms in square brackets of eq . . it can be easily seen that the factor },\\ ] ] describing the effect of phase screen on the beam , enters implicitly the integrand of eq . ( the indices are omitted here for the sake of brevity ) . there are integrations over variables as shown in eq . . furthermore , the brackets , which indicate averaging over different realizations of the atmosperic inhomogeneities , also indicate averaging over different states of the phase diffuser . as long as both types of averaging do not correlate , the factor  entering eq . must be averaged over different instants , . to begin with , let us consider the simplest case of two phase correlations }\\big > .\\ ] ] it is evident that in the case , as shown schematically in fig . 1 , the factor  is sizable if only points and are close to one another . two curves correspond to different instants and . ] therefore , the term given by eq . can be replaced by where is considered to be a gaussian random variable with the mean - square values given by ^ 2\\rangle = \\langle ^2\\rangle = 2\\lambda c^{-2} ] . as we see , the effect of the phase screen can be described by two parameters , and , which characterize the spatial and temporal coherence of the laser beam . in the limiting case , , the second term in eq . vanishes and the problem is reduced to the case considered in refs . , . in the opposite case , , both terms in eq . are important . this is shown in ref . . in what follows , we will see that these two limiting cases have physical interpretations where where ( slow detector ) and ( fast detector ) , respectively . there is a specific realization of the diffuser in which a random phase distribution moves across the beam . ( this situation can be modeled by a rotating transparent disk with large diameter and varying thickness . ) the phase depends here on the only variable , i.e. where is the velocity of the drift . then we have }+e^{-\\lambda c^{-2}}.\\ ] ] comparing eqs . and , we see that the quantity , , stands for the characteristic parameter describing the efficiency of the phase diffuser . the criterion of slow \" detector requires . qualitatively , the two scenarios of phase variations , given by eqs . and , affect in a similar way the intensity fluctuations . in what follows , we consider the first of them as the simplest one . ( this is because the spatial and temporal variables in , given by eq . , are separable . ) vs propagation distance in the case of `` slow '' detector : . the parameter indicates different initial coherence length . in the absence of phase diffuser ( solid line ) . is the conventional parameter describing a strength of the atmospheric turbulence . ] substituting the expressions for operators given by eq . with account for the phase factors and averaging over time as shown in eq . , we obtain \\bigg > , \\ ] ] where the notation after sums indicates averaging over different realizations of the atmospheric refractive index . the parameter describes the initial coherence length modified by the phase diffuser . other notations are defined by following relations further calculations follow the scheme described in ref . 2 illustrates the effect of the phase diffuser on scintillations in the limit of a slow \" detector  . we can see a considerable decrease in caused by the phase diffuser . at the same time , the effect of the phase screen on becomes weaker for finite values of . moreover , comparing the two upper curves in fig . 3 , we see the opposite effect : slow phase variations  result in increased scintillations . there is a simple explanation for this phenomenon : the noise generated by the turbulence is complemented by the noise arising from the random phase screen . the integration time of the detector , , is not sufficiently large for averaging phase variations generated by the diffuser . the function , , has a very simple form in the two limits : ( i) , when ; and ( ii ) , when . then , in case ( i ) and for small values of the initial coherence differs from analogous one in ref . by the value that is much less than unity but , nevertheless , can be comparable or even greater than . in case ( ii ) , the asymptotic value of is close to unity , coinciding with the results of refs . and . this agrees with well known behavior of the scintillation index to approach unity for any source distribution , provided the response time of the recording instrument is short compared with the source coherence time . ( see , for example , survey ) . a similar tendency can be seen in both figs . 3 and 4 : the curves with the smallest , used for numerical calculations  , are close to the curves without diffuser \" in spite of the small initial coherence length . ] it follows from our analysis that the scintillation index is very sensitive to the diffuser parameters , and , for long propagation paths . on the other hand , the characteristics of the irradience such as beam radius , , and angle - of - arrival spread , , do not depend on the presence of the phase diffuser for large values of . to see this , the following analysis is useful . the beam radius expressed in terms of the distribution function is given by straightforward calculations using eq . with ( see ref . ) result in the following explicit form : where and is the inner radius of turbulent eddies , which in our previous calculations was assumed to be equal m . as we see , the third term does not depend on the diffuser parameters and it dominates when . a similar situation holds for the angle - of - arrival spread , .

{"article": "the so - called `` nucleon spin crisis '' raised by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) measurement in 1988 is one of the most outstanding findings in the field of hadron physics , . the renaissance of the physics of high energy deep inelastic scatterings is greatly indebted to this epoch - making finding . probably , one of the most outstanding progresses achieved recently in this field of physics is the discovery and the subsequent research of completely new observables called generalized parton distribution functions ( gpd ) . it has been revealed that the gpds , which can be measured through the so - called deeply - virtual compton scatterings ( dvcs ) or the deeply - virtual meson productions ( dvmp ) , contain surprisingly richer information than the standard parton distribution functions . roughly speaking , the gpds are generalization of ordinary parton distributions and the elastic form factors of the nucleon . the gpds in the most general form are functions of three kinematical variables : the average longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck parton in the initial and final states , a skewdness parameter which measures the difference between two momentum fractions , and the four - momentum - transfer square of the initial and final nucleon . in the forward limit , some of the gpds reduce to the usual quark , antiquark and gluon distributions . on the other hand , taking the -th moment of the gpds with respect to the variable , one obtains the generalizations of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , which are called the generalized form factors of the nucleon . the complex nature of the gpds , i.e. the fact that they are functions of three variable , makes it quite difficult to grasp their full characteristics both experimentally and theoretically . from the theoretical viewpoint , it may be practical to begin studies with the two limiting cases . the one is the forward limit of zero momentum transfer . we have mentioned that , in this limit , some of the gpds reduce to the ordinary parton distribution function depending on one variable . however , it turns out that , even in this limit , there appear some completely new distribution functions , which can not be accessed by the ordinary inclusive deep - inelastic scattering measurements . very interestingly , it was shown by ji that one of such distributions contains valuable information on the total angular momentum carried by the quark fields in the nucleon . this information , combined with the known knowledge on the longitudinal quark polarization , makes it possible to determine the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the total nucleon spin purely experimentally . another relatively - easy - to - handle quantities are the generalized form factors of the nucleon , , which are given as the non - forward nucleon matrix elements of the spin- , twist - two quark and gluon operators . since these latter quantities are given as the nucleon matrix elements of local operators , they can be objects of lattice qcd simulations . ( it should be compared with parton distributions . the direct calculation of parton distributions is beyond the scope of lattice qcd simulations , since it needs to treat the nucleon matrix elements of quark bilinears , which are nonlocal in time . ) in fact , two groups , the lhpc collaboration and the qcdsf collaboration independently investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , and gave several interesting predictions , which can in principle be tested by the measurement of gpds in the near future . although interesting , there is no a priori reason to believe that the predictions of these lattice simulations are realistic enough . the reason is mainly that the above mentioned lattice simulation were carried out in the heavy pion regime around with neglect of the so - called disconnected diagrams . our real world is rather close to the chiral limit with vanishing pion mass , and we know that , in this limit , the goldstone pion plays very important roles in some intrinsic properties of the nucleon . the lattice simulation carried out in the heavy pion region is in danger of missing some important role of chiral dynamics . on the other hand , the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) is an effective model of baryons , which maximally incorporates the chiral symmetry of qcd and its spontaneous breakdown , . ( see for early reviews . ) it was already applied to the physics of ordinary parton distribution functions with remarkable success . for instance , an indispensable role of pion - like quark - antiquark correlation was shown to be essential to understand the famous nmc measurement , which revealed the dominance of the -quark over the -quark inside the proton ,, . then , it would be interesting to see what predictions the cqsm would give for the quantities mentioned above . now , the main purpose of the present study is to study the generalized form factors of the nucleon within the framework of the cqsm and compare its predictions with those of the lattice qcd simulations . of our particular interest here is to see the change of final theoretical predictions against the variation of the pion mass . such an analysis is expected to give some hints for judging the reliability of the lattice qcd predictions at the present level for the observables in question . the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.ii , we shall briefly explain how to introduce the nonzero pion mass into the scheme of the cqsm with pauli - villars regularization . in sect.iii , we derive the theoretical expressions for the generalized form factors of the nucleon . sect.iv is devoted to the discussion of the results of the numerical calculations . some concluding remarks are then given in sect.v . we start with the basic effective lagrangian of the chiral quark soliton model in the chiral limit given as with which describes the effective quark fields , with a dynamically generated mass , strongly interacting with pions , . since one of the main purposes of the present study is to see how the relevant observables depend on pion mass , we add to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term given by . \\ ] ] here the trace in  is to be taken with respect to flavor indices . the total model lagrangian is therefore given by naturally , one could have taken an alternative choice in which the explicit chiral - symmetry - breaking effect is introduced in the form of current quark mass term as . we did not do so , because we do not know any consistent regularization of such effective lagrangian with finite current quark mass within the framework of the pauli - villars subtraction scheme , as explained in appendix of . the effective action corresponding to the above lagrangian is given as = s f + s m , \\ ] ] with = - \\,i \\,n c \\, \\ , \\ln ( i \\not\\!\\partial -

violet divergences . to remove these divergences , we must introduce physical cutoffs . for the purpose of regularization , here we use the pauli - villars subtraction scheme . as explained in , we must eliminate not only the logarithmic divergence contained in ] with replaced by the pauli - villars regulator mass . these parameters are fixed as follows . first , the quadratic and logarithmic divergence contained in the equation of motion ( or in the expression of the vacuum quark condensate ) can , respectively , removed if the subtraction constants satisfy the following two conditions : ( we recall that the condition which removes the logarithmic divergence in ] with respect to the variation of the profile function : \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 4 \\pi r^2 \\,\\left\\ { - \\,m \\, + f {\\pi}^2 m {\\pi}^2 \\sin f ( r ) \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] which gives here and are regularized scalar and pseudoscalar quark densities given as with while and are the corresponding densities evaluated with the regulator mass instead of the dynamical quark mass . we also note that and . as usual , a self - consistent soliton solution is obtained as follows with use of kahana and ripka s discretized momentum basis , . first by assuming an appropriate ( though arbitrary ) soliton profile , the eigenvalue problem of the dirac hamiltonian is solved . using the resultant eigenfunctions and their associated eigenenergies , one can calculate the regularized scalar and pseudoscalar densities and . with use of these and , eq. can then be used to obtain a new soliton profile . the whole procedure above is repeated with this new profile until the self - consistency is attained . since the generalized form factors of the nucleon are given as moments of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , it is convenient to start with the theoretical expressions of the unpolarized gpds and within the cqsm . following the notation in , , we introduce the quantities and here , the isoscalar and isovector combinations respectively correspond to the sum and the difference of the quark flavors and . the relation between these quantities and the generalized parton distribution functions and are obtained most conveniently in the so - called breit frame . they are given by where these two independent combinations of and can be extracted through the spin projection of as where tr \" denotes the trace over spin indices , while . now , within the cqsm , it is possible to evaluate the right - hand side ( rhs ) of  and  . since the answers are already given in several previous papers , we do not repeat the derivation . here we comment only on the following general structure of the theoretical expressions for relevant observables in the cqsm . the leading contribution just corresponds to the mean field prediction , which is independent of the collective rotational velocity of the hedgehog soliton . the next - to - leading order term takes account of the linear response of the internal quark motion to the rotational motion as an external perturbation , and consequently it is proportional to . it is known that the leading - order term contributes to the isoscalar combination of and to the isovector combination of , while the isoscalar part of and the isovector part of survived only at the next - to - leading order of ( or of ) . the leading - order gpds are then given as here the symbol denotes the summation over the occupied ( the valence plus negative - energy dirac sea ) quark orbitals in the hedgehog mean field . on the other hand , the theoretical expressions for the isovector part of and the isoscalar part of , which survive at the next - to - leading order , are a little more complicated . they are given as double sums over the single quark orbitals as \\ , e^{i x m n z^0 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\ , & \\times \\ \\langle n | \\tau^a | m \\rangle \\langle m | \\,\\tau^a \\,(1 + \\gamma^0 \\gamma^3 ) \\ , e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) 3 } \\ , e^{i { } \\cdot { } } \\,e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) 3 } | n \\rangle . \\ ] ] and e^{i x m n z^0 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\ , & \\times \\ \\langle n | \\tau^b | m \\rangle \\langle m | \\,(1 + \\gamma^0 \\gamma^3 ) \\,e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) 3 } \\ , \\delta^a}{{} {\\perp}^2 } \\ , e^{i { } \\cdot { } } \\,e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) 3 } | n \\rangle . \\ ] ] these four expressions for the unpolarized gpds , i.e.   , are the basic starting equations for our present study of the generalized form factors of the nucleon within the cqsm . there are infinite tower of generalized form factors , which are defined as the -th moments of gpds . in the present study , we confine ourselves to the 1st and the 2nd moments , which respectively corresponds to the standard electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and the so - called gravitational form factors . we are especially interested in the second one , since they are believed to contain valuable information on the spin contents of the nucleon through ji s angular momentum sum rule , . for each isospin channel , the 1st and the 2nd moments of define the sachs - electric and gravito - electric form factors as and on the other hand , the 1st and the 2nd moments of respectively define the sachs - magnetic and gravito - magnetic form factors as and in the following , we shall explain how we can calculate the generalized form factors based on the theoretical expressions of corresponding gpds , by taking and as examples . setting and integrating over in  , we obtain putting this expression into  , we have it is easy to see that , using the generalized spherical symmetry of the hedgehog configuration , the term containing the factor identically vanishes , so that is reduced to a simple form as follows : aside from the factor , this is nothing but the known expression for the isoscalar sachs - electric form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm . a less trivial example is , which is defined as the 2nd moment of . inserting  into  and carrying out the integration over , we obtain using the partial - wave expansion of , this can be written as this can further be divided into four pieces as where with to proceed further , we first notice that , by using the generalized spherical symmetry , survives only when , i.e. which leads to the result : to evaluate , we first note that ^{(\\lambda ) } .\\ ] ] here , the generalized spherical symmetry dictates that must be zero , so that the rhs of the above equation is effectively reduced to ^{(0 ) } .\\ ] ] this then gives ^{(0 ) } \\ , \\phi n ( { } ) .\\ ] ] owing to the identity we therefore find that next we investigate the third term . using ^{(\\lambda ) } \\ \\sim \\ -

electric form factor of the nucleon . analogously , we may call the gravitoelectric form factor of the nucleon ( its quark part ) , since it is related to the nonforward nucleon matrix elements of the quark part of the qcd energy momentum tensor . the other generalized form factors can be obtained in a similar way . the isovector part of the generalized electric form factors survive only at the next - to - leading order of . they are given as and ^{(1 ) } \\times { } ] ^{(0 ) } \\,{ } \\,|| n \\rangle \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] the isoscalar combination of the generalized magnetic form factors also survive only at the next - to - leading order of , so that they are given as double sums over the single - quark orbitals in the hedgehog mean field as and we recall that just coincides with the known expression of the isoscalar sachs - magnetic form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm . on the other hand , is sometimes called the gravitomagnetic form factor of the nucleon ( its isoscalar part ) , which we can evaluate within the qcsm based on the above theoretical expression . finally , the leading - order contribution to the isovector part of the generalized magnetic form factors are given as and especially interesting to us are the values of the generalized form factors in the forward limit . the consideration of this limit is also useful for verifying consistency of our theoretical analyses , since it leads to fundamental sum rules discussed below . we first consider the forward limit of . from  , we find that subtracting the corresponding vacuum contribution , this reduces to . if we remember the relation the forward limit of  just leads to the sum rule : which denotes that the sum of the -quark and -quark numbers in the proton is three . next we turn to the forward limit of , which gives it is easy to see that , after regularization and vacuum subtraction , the first term of the rhs of the above equation reduces to the fermion ( quark ) part of the soliton energy , i.e. in  . it was proved in that , in the cqsm with vanishing pion mass , the following identity holds : in the case of finite pion mass , which we are handling , this identity does not hold . instead , we can prove ( see appendix ) that that is , the second term in the parenthesis of rhs of eq. just coincides with the pion part of the soliton energy ( or mass ) . since the sum of the quark and pion part give the total soliton mass , we then find that in consideration of eq. , this relation can also be expressed as which means that the total momentum fraction carried by quark fields ( the - and -quarks ) is just unity . this is an expected result , since the cqsm contains quark fields only ( note that the pion is not an independent field of quarks ) , so that the total nucleon momentum should be saturated by the quark fields alone . taking the forward limit of , we are again led to a trivial sum rule , constrained by the conservation low . in fact , we have thereby leading to which denotes that the difference of the -quark and the -quark numbers in the proton is just unity . on the other hand , the forward limit of leads to the first nontrivial sum rule as since this quantity , which represents the difference of momentum fraction carried by the -quark and the -quark in the proton , is not constrained by any conservation law , its actual value can be estimated only numerically . next we turn to the discussion of the forward limit of the generalized magnetic form factors . first , the forward limit of gives which reproduces the known expression of the isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon in the cqsm . on the other hand , the forward limit of gives it was shown in that the rhs of the above equation is just unity , i.e. in consideration of  , this identity can be recast into a little different form as \\,d x .\\ ] ] assuming the familiar angular momentum sum rule due to ji \\,d x = j^{u + d } , \\ ] ] the above identity claims that which means that the nucleon spin is saturated by the quark fields alone . this is again a reasonable result , because the cqsm is an effective quark model which contains no explicit gluon fields . the derived identity  has still another interpretation . remembering the fact that consists of two parts as eq. dictates that since it also holds that ( the momentum sum rule ) it immediately follows that which is interpreted as showing the absence of the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon . finally , we investigate the forward limit of the isovector combination of the generalized magnetic form factors . from eq .  , we get which reproduces the known expression of the isovector magnetic form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm . on the other hand , letting in  , we have as shown in , this sum rule can be recast into the form : where consists of two parts as here , the first part is given as a proton matrix element of the free field expression for the isovector total angular momentum operator of quark fields as with \\ , \\psi ( { } ) \\,d^3 x \\nonumber \\\\ & = & f^{(i = 1 ) } + {2 } \\,^{(i = 1 ) } .\\ ] ] on the other hand , the second term is given as | n \\rangle .\\ ] ] the model in the chiral limit contains two parameters , the weak pion decay constant and the dynamical quark mass . as usual , is fixed to its physical value , i.e. . for the mass parameter , there is some argument based on the instanton liquid picture of the qcd vacuum that it is not extremely far from . the previous phenomenological analysis of various static baryon observables based on this model prefer a slightly larger value of between and . in the present analysis , we use the value . with this value of , we prepare self - consistent soliton solutions for seven values of , i.e. and , in order to see the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors etc . favorable physical predictions of the model will be obtained by using the value of and , since this set gives a self - consistent soliton solution close to the phenomenologically successful one obtained with and in the single - subtraction pauli - villars regularization scheme . we first show in fig. the soliton profile functions obtained with several values of , i.e. , and . one sees that the spatial size of the soliton profile becomes more and more compact as the pion mass increases . and , and .,width=340,height=264 ] we are now ready to show the theoretical predictions of the cqsm for the generalized form factors . since the corresponding lattice predictions are given for the generalized form factors and , which are the generalization of the standard dirac and pauli form factors , we first write down the relations between these form factors and the generalized sachs - type factors , which we have calculated in the cqsm . they are given by \\,/\\ , ( 1 + \\tau ) , \\\\ a {20}^{u + d } ( t ) & = & \\left \\,/\\ , ( 1 + \\tau ) , \\\\ a {10}^{u - d } ( t ) & = & \\left \\,/\\ , ( 1 + \\tau ) , \\\\ a {20}^{u -

d } ( t ) & = & \\left \\,/\\ , ( 1 + \\tau ) , \\ ] ] where . we recall that and are nothing but the standard dirac and pauli form factors of the nucleon : since the lattice simulations by the lhpc and qcdsf collaborations were carried out in the heavy pion region around and since the simulation in the small pion mass region is hard to perform , we think it interesting to investigate the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors within the framework of the cqsm . for simplicity , we shall show the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors at the zero momentum transfer only . we think it enough for our purpose because the generalized form factors at the zero momentum transfer contain the most important information for clarifying the underlying spin structure of the nucleon . at zero momentum transfer , the relations between the generalized dirac and pauli form factors and the generalized sachs - type form factors are simplified to become and and as functions of ( the filled diamonds ) , together with the corresponding lattice predictions . here , the open triangles correspond to the predictions of the lhpc group , while the open squares to those of the qcdsf collaboration .,width=604,height=264 ] fig. shows the predictions of the cqsm for and as functions of , together with the corresponding lattice predictions . as for , the cqsm predictions and the lattice qcd predictions are both independent of and consistent with the constraint of the quark number sum rule : with high numerical precision . turning to , one finds a sizable difference between the predictions of the cqsm and of the lattice qcd . the lattice qcd predicts that which means that only about of the total nucleon momentum is carried by the quark fields , while the rest is borne by the gluon fields . on the other hand , the cqsm predictions for the same quantity is which means that the quark fields saturates the total nucleon momentum . this may certainly be a limitation of an effective quark model , which contains no explicit gluon fields . note , however , that the total quark momentum fraction is a scale dependent quantity . the lattice result corresponds to the energy scale of , while the cqsm prediction should be taken as that of the model energy scale around . we shall later make more meaningful comparison by taking care of the scale dependencies of relevant observables . and as functions of , together with the corresponding lattice predictions , . the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig..,width=604,height=264 ] next , in fig. , we show the isovector combination of the generalized form factors and . the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig. . as for , both the cqsm and the lattice simulation reproduce the quark number sum rule with good prediction . turning to , one observes that the prediction of the cqsm shows somewhat peculiar dependence on the pion mass . starting from a fairly small value in the chiral limit  , it first increases as increases , but as further increases it begins to decrease , thereby showing a tendency to match the lattice prediction in the heavy pion region . very interestingly , letting put aside the absolute value , a similar dependence is also observed in the chiral extrapolation of the lattice prediction for the momentum fraction shown in fig.25 of . physically , the quantity has a meaning of the difference of the momentum fractions carried by the -quark and the -quark . the empirical value for it is . one sees that the prediction of the cqsm in the chiral limit is not far from this empirical information , although more serious comparison must take account of the scale dependence of . and as functions of , together with the corresponding lattice predictions , . the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig..,width=604,height=264 ] next , shown in fig. are the cqsm predictions for and . the former quantity is related to the isoscalar combination of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment as . ( we recall that its empirical value is . ) we find that this quantity is very sensitive to the variation of the pion mass . it appears that the cqsm prediction corresponding to chiral limit underestimates the observation significantly . however , the difference is exaggerated too much in this comparison . in fact , if we carry out a comparison in the total isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon , the cqsm in the chiral limit gives in comparison with the observed value . to our knowledge , no theoretical predictions are given for this quantity by either of the lhpc or qcdsf collaborations . the right panel of fig.4 shows the predictions for , which is sometimes called the isoscalar part of the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment , or alternatively the net quark contribution to the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment . as already pointed out , the prediction of the cqsm for this quantity is exactly zero : i.e. the explicit numerical calculation also confirms it . it should be recognized that the above result obtained in the cqsm is just a necessary consequence of the momentum sum rule and the total nucleon spin sum rule , both of which are saturated by the quark field only in the cqsm as and \\ = \\ \\langle j \\rangle^{u + d } \\ = \\ {2 } .\\ ] ] in real qcd , the gluon also contributes to these sum rules , thereby leading to more general identities : + = 1 , \\ ] ] which constrains that only the sum of and is forced to vanish as ( while we neglect here the contributions of other quarks than the - and -quarks , it loses no generality in our discussion below . in fact , to include them , we have only to replace the combination by . ) the above nontrivial identity claims that the net contributions of quark and gluon fields to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon must be zero . an interesting question is whether the quark and gluon contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment vanishes separately or they are both large with opposite sign . a perturbative analysis based on a very simple toy model indicates the latter possibility . on the other hand , a nonperturbative analysis within the framework of the lattice qcd indicates that the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment is small or nearly zero , , . ( to be more precise , we sees that the prediction of the lhpc collaboration for is slightly negative , while that of the qcdsf group is slightly positive . ) this strongly indicates a surprising possibility that the quark and gluon contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon may separately vanish . worthy of special mention here is an interesting argument given by teryaev some years ago , claiming that the vanishing net quark contributions to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , violated in perturbation theory , is expected to be restored in full nonperturbative qcd due to the confinement ,, . very interestingly , once it actually happens , it leads to a surprisingly simple result , i.e. the proportionality of the quark momentum and angular momentum fraction as advocated by teryaev ,, . a far reaching physical consequence resulting from this observation was extensively discussed in our recent report . ( see also the discussion at the end of this section . ) and as functions of , together with the corresponding lattice predictions , . the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig..,width=604,height=264 ] next , we show in fig. the predictions for the isovector case , i.e. and . we recall first that the quantity represents the isovector combination of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment , the empirical value of which is known to be . one find that this quantity is extremely sensitive to the variation of the pion mass especially near . this is only natural if one remembers the important role of the pion cloud in the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon . ( one may notice that the prediction of the cqsm for underestimates a little its empirical value even in the chiral limit . we recall , however , that , within the framework of the cqsm , there is an important correction or the 1st order rotational correction to some kind of isovector quantities like the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon in question or the axial - vector coupling constant of the nucleon . this next - to - leading correction in should also be taken into account in more advanced investigations . ) shown in the right panel of fig. is the theoretical predictions for , the half of which can be interpreted as the difference of the total angular momentum carried by the -quark and the -quark fields according to ji s angular momentum sum rule . the cqsm predicts fairly small value for this quantity , in contrast to the lattice predictions of sizable magnitude . it seems that the pion mass dependence rescues this discrepancy only partially . here we argue that , the reason why the cqsm ( in the chiral limit ) gives rather small prediction for this quantity is intimately connected with the characteristic dependence of the quantity , the forward limit of the isovector unpolarized spin - flip gpd of the nucleon . to show it , we first recall that , within the theoretical frame work of the cqsm , as well as are calculated as difference of and and of and , respectively , as although the quantities of the rhs can be calculated directly without recourse to any distribution functions , they can also be evaluated as -weighted integrals of the corresponding gpds as the distribution function has already been calculated within the cqsm in our recent paper . as shown there , the dirac sea contribution to this quantity has a sizably large peak around . since this significant peak due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks is approximately symmetric with respect to the reflection , it hardly contributes to the second moment , whereas it gives a sizable contribution to the first moment . the predicted significant peak of around can physically be interpreted as the effects of pion cloud . it can be convinced in several ways . first , we investigate how this behavior of changes as the pion mass is varied . obtained with and .,width=340,height=264 ] dependence of .,width=604,height=264 ] shown in fig. and in fig. are the cqsm predictions for with several values of . i.e. , and . one clearly sees that the height of the peak around , due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks , decreases rapidly as increases . this supports our interpretation of this peak as the effects of pion clouds . on the other hand , one also observes that the magnitude of the valence quark contribution , peaked around , gradually increases as becomes large . this behavior of turns out to cause a somewhat unexpected dependence of and . as a function of , the dirac sea contribution to decreases fast , whereas the valence quark contribution to it increases slowly , so that the total becomes a decreasing function of . on the other hand , owing to the approximate odd - function nature of the dirac sea contribution to with respect to , it hardly contributes to independent of the pion mass , while the valence quark contribution to is an increasing function of , thereby leading to the result that the net is a increasing function of . obtained with and .,width=340,height=264 ] dependence of .,width=604,height=264 ] we can give still another support to the above - mentioned interpretation of the contribution of the dirac - sea quarks . to see it , we first recall that the theoretical unpolarized distribution function appearing in the decomposition also has a sizable peak around due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks . as shown in fig. and in fig. , this peak is again a rapidly decreasing function of , supporting our interpretation of it as the effects of pion clouds . here , we can say more . we point out that this small- behavior of is just what is required by the famous nmc measurement . to confirm it , first remember that the distribution in the negative region should actually be interpreted as the distribution of antiquarks . to be explicit , it holds that the large and positive value of in the negative region close to means that is negative , i.e. the dominance of the -quark over the -quark inside the proton , which has been established by the nmc measurement . evolved to and in comparison with the hermes and nutev data at the corresponding energy scales ,.,width=340,height=283 ] shown in fig. are the predictions of the cqsm for evolved to the high energy scales corresponding to the experimental observation . ( the theoretical predictions here were obtained with and . ) the model reproduces well the observed behavior of , although the magnitude of the flavor asymmetry in smaller region seems to be slightly overestimated . it is a widely accepted fact that this flavor asymmetry of the sea quark distribution in the proton can physically be understood as the effects of pion cloud at least qualitatively . this then supports our interpretation of the effects of the deformed dirac - sea quarks in and as the effects of pion clouds . .the dependencies of , , and in the cqsm with . in this paper , we have investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , which will be extracted through near - future measurements of the generalized parton distribution functions , within the framework of the cqsm . a particular emphasis is put on the pion mass dependence as well as the scale dependence of the model predictions , which we compare with the corresponding predictions of the lattice qcd by the lhpc and the qcdsf collaborations carried out in the heavy pion regime around . the generalized form factors contain the ordinary electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon such as the dirac and pauli form factors of the proton and the neutron . we have shown that the cqsm with good chiral symmetry reproduces well the general behaviors of the observed electromagnetic form factors , while the lattice simulations by the above two groups have a tendency to underestimate the electromagnetic sizes of the nucleon . undoubtedly , this can not be unrelated to the fact that the above two lattice simulations were performed with unrealistically heavy pion mass . we have also tried to figure out the underlying spin contents of the nucleon through the analysis of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic form factors of the nucleon , by taking care of the pion mass despondencies as well as of the scale dependencies of the relevant quantities . after taking account of the scale dependencies by means of the qcd evolution equations at the nlo in the scheme , the cqsm predicts , at , that , and , which means that the quark orbital angular momentum carries sizable amount of total nucleon spin even at such a relatively high energy scale . it contradicts the conclusion of the lhpc and qcdsf collaborations indicating that the total orbital angular momentum of quarks is very small or consistent with zero . it should be recognized , however , that the prediction of the cqsm for the total quark angular momentum is not extremely far from the corresponding lattice prediction at the same renormalization scale . the cause of discrepancy can therefore be traced back to the lhpc and qcdsf lattice qcd predictions for the quark spin fraction around 0.6 , which contradicts not only the prediction of the cqsm but also the emc observation . as was shown in our recent paper , is such a quantity that is extremely sensitive to the variation of the pion mass , especially in the region close to the chiral limit . more serious lattice qcd studies on the -dependence of is highly desirable . worthy of special mention is the fact that , once we accept a theoretical postulate , i.e , the absence of the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , which is supported by both of the lhpc and qcdsf lattice simulations , we are necessarily led to a surprisingly simple relations , and , i.e. the proportionality of the linear and angular momentum fractions carried by the quarks and the gluons . using these relations , together with the existing empirical information for the unpolarized and the longitudinally polarized pdfs , we can give model - independent predictions for the quark and gluon contents of the nucleon spin . for instance , with combined use of the mrst2004 fit and the dns2005 fit , we obtain , , and at . since ( as well as ) is a rapidly decreasing function of the energy scale , while the scale dependence of is very weak , we must conclude that the former is even more dominant over the latter at the scale below where any low energy models are supposed to hold . the situation is a little more complicated in the flavor - nonsinglet ( or isovector ) channel , because , and also because the cqsm and the lattice qcd give fairly different predictions for . as compared with the lattice prediction for around , the predictions of the cqsm turns out to be around . we have argued that the relatively small value of obtained in the cqsm is intimately connected with the small enhancement of the generalized parton distribution , which is dominated by the clouds of pionic excitation around . ( we recall that the 2nd moment of gives . ) unfortunately , such a -dependent distribution as can not be accessed within the framework of lattice qcd . still , the predicted small behavior of as well as of indicates again the importance of chiral dynamics in the nucleon structure function physics , which has not been fully accounted for in the lattice qcd simulation at the present level . this work is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research for ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan ( no . c-16540253 ) here we closely follow the proof of the momentum sum rule given in , by taking into account a necessary modification in the case of . the starting point is the following expression for the soliton mass ( or the static soliton energy ) : \\ - \\ ( h \\rightarrow h 0 ) \\ + \\ e m , \\ ] ] with \\ = \\ - \\,f \\pi^2 \\,m \\pi^2 \\,\\int \\ , \\,d^3 x . \\ ] ] the soliton mass must be stationary with respect to an arbitrary variation of the chiral field or equivalently the soliton profile , which lead to a saddle point equation : \\ + \\ \\delta e m \\ = \\ 0 .\\ ] ] here we consider a particular ( dilatational ) variation of chiral field for infinitesimal , we have so that \\ = \\ \\xi \\ , ( - i \\gamma^0 \\gamma^k \\partial k ) .\\ ] ] noting the identity ) \\ = \\ ( x^k \\partial k ) \\ = \\ 0 , \\ ] ] we therefore obtain a key identity = - \\,\\delta e m . \\ ] ] now , by using  together with the relations , we get here , taking account of the boundary condition we can manipulate as we thus find an important relation : putting this relation into  , we have or if we evaluate the trace sum above by using the eigenstates of the static dirac hamiltonian as a complete set of basis ,  can also be written as which is the relation quoted in  . we point out that our result has a correct chiral limit , since as and therefore in conformity with the proof given in ref. .", "summary": "with a special intention of clarifying the underlying spin contents of the nucleon , we investigate the generalized form factors of the nucleon , which are defined as the -th -moments of the generalized parton distribution functions , within the framework of the chiral quark soliton model . a particular emphasis is put on the pion mass dependence of final predictions , which we shall compare with the predictions of lattice qcd simulations carried out in the so - called heavy pion region around . we find that some observables are very sensitive to the variation of the pion mass . it will be argued that the negligible importance of the quark orbital angular momentum indicated by the lhpc and qcdsf lattice collaborations might be true in the unrealistic heavy pion world , but it is not necessarily the case in our real world close to the chiral limit ."}

these are natural generalisations of the sine function , indeed and they are known to share a number of remarkable properties with their classical counterpart . among these properties lies the fundamental question of completeness and linear independence of the family where . this question has received some attention recently , with a particular emphasis on the case . in the latter instance , is the set of eigenfunctions of the generalised eigenvalue problem for the one - dimensional -laplacian subject to dirichlet boundary conditions , which is known to be of relevance in the theory of slow / fast diffusion processes , . see also the related papers . set , so that is a schauder basis of the banach space for all . the family is also a schauder basis of if and only if the corresponding change of coordinates map , , extends to a linear homeomorphism of . the fourier coefficients of associated to obey the relation for , let ( note that for ) and let be the linear isometry such that . then so that the change of coordinates takes the form notions of `` nearness '' between bases of banach spaces are known to play a fundamental role in classical mathematical analysis , , or . unfortunately , the expansion strongly suggests that is not globally `` near '' , e.g. in the krein - lyusternik or the paley - wiener sense , . therefore classical arguments , such as those involving the paley - wiener stability theorem , are unlikely to be directly applicable in the present context . in fact , more rudimentary methods can be invoked in order to examine the invertibility of the change of coordinates map . from it follows that in it was claimed that the left side of held true for all where was determined to lie in the segment . hence would be a schauder basis , whenever . further developments in this respect were recently reported by bushell and edmunds . these authors cleverly fixed a gap originally published in ( * ? ? ? * lemma 5 ) and observed that , as the left side of ceases to hold true whenever the argument will break for near . therefore , the basisness question for should be tackled by different means in the regime . more recently , edmunds , gurka and lang , employed in order to show invertibility of for general pairs , as long as since is guaranteed whenever this allows for . however , note that a direct substitution of in , only leads to the sub - optimal condition . in section below we show that the family is - linearly independent for all , see theorem . in section we establish conditions ensuring that is a homeomorphism of in a neighbourhood of the region in the -plane where see theorem and also corollary . for this purpose , in section we find two further criteria which generalise in the hilbert space setting , see corollaries and . in this case , the riesz constant , characterises how deviates from being an orthonormal basis . these new statements yield upper bounds for , which improve upon those obtained from the right side of , even when the latter is applicable . the formulation of the alternatives to presented below relies crucially on work developed in section . from lemma we compute explicitly the wold decomposition of the isometries : they turn out to be shifts of infinite multiplicity . hence we can extract from the expansion suitable components which are toeplitz operators of scalar type acting on appropriate hardy spaces . as the theory becomes quite technical for the case and all the estimates analogous to those reported below would involve a dependence on the parameter , we have chosen to restrict our attention with regards to these improvements only to the already interesting hilbert space setting . section is concerned with particular details of the case of equal indices , and it involves results on both the general case and the specific case . rather curiously , we have found another gap which renders incomplete the proof of invertibility of for originally published in . see remark . moreover , the application of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.5 ) only gets to a basisness threshold of , where is defined by the identity see also ( * ? ? ? * remark 2.1 ) . in theorem we show that is indeed a schauder basis of for where , see ( * ? ? ? * problem 1 ) . as , basisness is now guaranteed for all . see figure . in section we report on our current knowledge of the different thresholds for invertibility of the change of coordinates map , both in the case of equal indices and otherwise . based on the new criteria found in section , we formulate a general test of invertibility for which is amenable to analytical and numerical investigation . this test involves finding sharp bounds on the first few coefficients . see proposition . for the case of equal indices , this test indicates that is a riesz basis of for where . all the numerical quantities reported in this paper are accurate up to the last digit shown , which is rounded to the nearest integer . in the appendix we have included fully reproducible computer codes which can be employed to verify the calculations reported . a family in a banach space is called -linearly independent , if for all , the family is -linearly independent in . moreover , if the linear extension of the map is a bounded operator , then for the first assertion we show that . let be such that where the series is convergent in the norm of . then hence we show that all by means of a double induction argument . suppose that . we prove that all . indeed , clearly from with . now assume inductively that for all .

contradict the fact that , necessarily all so that . the second assertion is shown as follows . assume that . if , then for all , so which in turns means that for all . on the other hand , if the latter holds true for , then for all , so , as required . therefore , is a riesz basis of if and only if and . a simple example illustrates how a family of dilated periodic functions can break its property of being a riesz basis . let ] located at : set and { }x .\\ ] ] then for and for . since for all , then hence the next two corollaries are consequences of corollary and lemma , and are among the main results of this paper . let where the top on left side of and the fact that imply thus , the bottom on the left side of yields so indeed is invertible . the estimate on the riesz constant is deduced from the triangle inequality . since , supersedes , only when the pair is such that . from this corollary we see below that the change of coordinates is invertible in a neighbourhood of the threshold set by the condition . see proposition and figures and . the proof is similar to that of corollary . we see below that corollary is slightly more useful than corollary in the context of the dilated -sine functions . however the latter is needed in the proof of the main theorem . it is of course natural to ask what consequences can be derived from the other statement in lemma . for we have . hence the same argument as in the proofs of corollaries and would reduce to , and in this case there is no improvement . our first goal in this section is to establish that the change of coordinates map associated to the family is invertible beyond the region of applicability of . we begin by recalling a calculation which was performed in the proof of ( * ? ? ? * proposition 4.1 ) and which will be invoked several times below . let be the inverse function of . then indeed , integrating by parts twice and changing the variable of integration to yields ' \\sin(j\\pi x ) { }x \\\\ & =

there exists a neighbourhood , such that the change of coordinates is invertible for all . from the dominated convergence theorem , it follows that each is a continuous function of the parameters and . therefore , by virtue of and a further application of the dominated convergence theorem , also is continuous in the parameters and . here can be any fixed set of indices , but below in this proof we only need to consider for the first possibility and for the second possibility . write . the hypothesis implies , because therefore for a suitable neighbourhood . two possibilities are now in place . note that is an immediate consequence of and . by continuity of all quantities involved , there exists a neighbourhood such that the left hand side and hence the right hand side of hold true for all . substitute and . if , then indeed , the conditions on and give as , thus which is . hence thus , once again by continuity of all quantities involved , there exists a neighbourhood such that the left hand side and hence the right hand side of hold true for all . the conclusion follows by defining either or . we now examine other further consequences of the corollaries and . any of the following conditions ensure the invertibility of the change of coordinates map . 1 .  : 2 .  : , , and 3 .  : , , and from , it follows that hence the condition implies that the hypothesis is satisfied . by virtue of lemma , it is guaranteed that in the settings of or . from , it also follows that combining each one of these assertions with and , respectively , immediately leads to the claimed statement . we recover ( * ? ? ? * corollary 4.3 ) from the part of this theorem by observing that for all , in fact , for , the better estimate ensures invertibility of for all whenever see figures and . we now consider in closer detail the particular case . our analysis requires setting various sharp upper and lower bounds on the coefficients for . this is our first goal . employed to show bound in

was separated into two cases : and . with our definition by a factor of . note that the ground eigenfunction of the -laplacian equation in is denoted by and it equals as defined above . a key observation here is the -pythagorean identity . ] of the fourier coefficients , in the latter case it was claimed that was bounded above by as it turns , there is a missing power 2 in the term for this claim to be true . this corresponds to taking second derivatives of and it can be seen by applying the cauchy - schwartz inequality in . the missing factor is crucial in the argument and renders the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) incomplete in the latter case . in the paper published a few years later , it was claimed that the hypothesis of held true for where is defined by . it was then claimed that an approximated solution of was near . an accurate numerical approximation of , based on analytical bounds on , give the correct digits . therefore neither the results of nor those of

upon the value from . however , as remarked in , the upper bound ensuring and hence the validity of theorem - , is too crude for small values of . note for example that the correct regime is whereas

ensured as a consequence of the intermediate value theorem . from , it follows that for all . lemma guarantees positivity of for . then , by re - arranging this inequality , the second statement becomes a direct consequence of . a sharp numerical approximation of the solution of the equation with equality in gives . see figure . if sharp bounds on the first few fourier coefficients are at hand , the approach employed above for the proof of theorem can also be combined with the criteria or . a natural question is whether this would lead to a positive answer to the question of

that proposition can significantly improve the threshold for basisness with respect to a direct application of theorem - . as we increase , the boundary of the corresponding region moves to the left ,

{"article": "the simulations we discuss here allowed us to obtain spectra of the shg response . we employed comsol multiphysics software ( www.comsol.com ) in order to perform simulations of the linear optical response as described in ref . . a unit cell containing a single sic pillar attached to the sic substrate was constructed , with floquet boundary conditions along the -axis and periodic boundary conditions along the -axis , perpendicular to the plane of incidence . a p -polarized plane wave at frequency was launched towards the sic structure at an incident angle of 25 . originating from the p -polarised light source , the electric field inside the sic pillar and substrate was recorded . then , this electric field was translated into the nonlinear polarization , according to eq . ( 1 ) in the main manuscript . there , the following non - zero components of the nonlinear susceptibility were accounted for : , and . as a next step , in the pillar and the substrate was regarded as the source of scattered electric field inside the unit cell . the shg output was then obtained by integrating the power flow through a xy -plane set above the substrate . sweeping the fundamental frequency and taking the dispersion of both linear and nonlinear sic susceptibilities from refs. , we calculated several shg spectra for samples with various periodicity of the pillars . we note that in these calculations , the input power density at fundamental frequency was kept constant , and the shg output power was normalized to the area of the xy -plane . the results of the simulations presented in fig . in the main manuscript demonstrate a single pronounced peak corresponding to the excitation of the sphp monopole mode . barnes , w. l. ; dereux , a. ; ebbesen , t. w. surface plasmon subwavelength optics . nature ( london ) * 2003 * , 424 , 824830 maier , s. a. plasmonics : fundamentals and applications ; springer : new york , 2007 schuller , j. a. ; barnard , e. s. ; cai , w. ; jun , y. c. ; white , j. s. ; brongersma , m. l. plasmonics for extreme light concentration and manipulation . mater . * 2010 * , 9 , 193204 boriskina , s. v. ; ghasemi , h. ; chen , g. plasmonic materials for energy : from physics to applications . mater . today * 2013 * , 16 , 375386 brongersma , m. l. ; halas , n. j. ; nordlander , p. plasmon -

polaritons within the reststrahlen band . the magnitude of the shg peak at the monopole mode experiences a strong dependence on the resonant frequency beyond that described by the field localization degree and the dispersion of linear and nonlinear - optical sic properties . comparing the results for the identical nanostructures made of 4h and 6h sic polytypes , we demonstrate the interplay of localized surface phonon polaritons with zone - folded weak phonon modes of the anisotropic crystal . tuning the monopole mode in and out of the region where the zone - folded phonon is excited in 6h - sic , we observe a prominent increase of the already monopole - enhanced shg output when the two modes are coupled . envisioning this interplay as one of the showcase features of mid - infrared nonlinear nanophononics , we discuss its prospects for the effective engineering of nonlinear - optical materials with desired properties in the infrared spectral range . light localization in sub - wavelength volumes is a core of modern nanophotonics . conventional methods of achieving strong confinement of the electromagnetic fields extensively utilize unique properties of surface plasmons . a remarkable variety of objects and materials supporting these excitations ensures the key role of plasmonics in a broad range of applications . apart from unparalleled sensitivity of plasmonic structures to the optical properties of the environment , strong light localization facilitates nonlinear - optical effects . owing to the spectral tunability of the localized plasmon resonances and their sizeable nonlinearity , metallic nanostructures of different shapes and sizes have earned their place in nonlinear photonics . despite obvious advantages of plasmon - based nanophotonics , metallic nanoobjects exhibit significant optical losses , which lower the quality factor of the localized surface plasmon modes . fast plasmon damping ( typically on the order of 10 fs ) due to ohmic losses thus inhibits nonlinear - optical conversion . an alternative , promising metal - free approach has been suggested , utilizing polar dielectrics such as sic or bn for high - quality light confinement in the mid - infrared ( ir ) . in these materials , the subdiffractional confinement of electromagnetic radiation relies upon surface phonon polaritons ( sphp ) in the reststrahlen band : the electric polarization is created due to coherent oscillations of the ions instead of the electron or hole densities . due to the significantly longer scattering times associated with optical phonons as compared to surface plasmons , the lifetimes of sphps tend to be on the order of picoseconds , much longer than their plasmonic counterparts . in addition , due to energies associated with optical phonons , sphps with typical frequencies within the mid - ir  to the thz domain hold high promise for spectroscopic and nanophotonic applications . in this letter , we undertake a first step towards the largely unexplored domain of mid - ir nonlinear nanophononics . we study the nonlinear - optical response of localized sphps using nanostructures made of different polytypes of sic . using free electron laser ( fel ) radiation in the mid - ir spectral range , we probe second harmonic generation from rectangular arrays of sub - diffractional , cylindrical sic nanopillars . the shg yield in the reststrahlen band of sic demonstrates prominent enhancement at the wavelengths associated with the excitation of the sphp eigenmodes of the pillars . depending on both the size and the spatial periodicity of the pillars , the shg - probed eigenmode exhibits a spectral shift accompanied with strong variations of the shg intensity . analyzing different sic polytypes , we demonstrate the interplay of the localized sphps with the zone - folded optical phonon modes . we further conclude that strong coupling of the two modes allows for a significant additional modulation of the sphp - enhanced shg output . the schematic of our experimental approach is outlined in fig . ,a . we employed a non - collinear shg configuration discussed elsewhere to perform spectroscopic shg measurements on square arrays of 1 m - tall 4h - sic and 6h - sic pillars with the main axis of the arrays in the xz plane of incidence . the fundamental radiation incident at 28 and 62 degrees with respect to the normal to the sample surface was focused onto the sample with a peak fluence on the order of 10 mj/ . both 4h and 6h - sic samples were c - cut so that the c -axis of the crystals was parallel to the surface normal . typical shg and linear reflectivity spectra collected using the fel radiation for the two incident polarisations are presented in fig . ,b - e . there , the respective spectra of the bare substrate are shown for comparison . for p -polarised fundamental radiation ( fig . ,d ) , the shg response features two pronounced peaks located at the zone - center frequencies of transverse and longitudinal optical phonons in sic , around 797 and 965 , respectively . the corresponding shg spectrum from the nanopillars demonstrate a much stronger shg signal at around 900 . due to the absence of this peak in the shg spectrum when the fundamental radiation is s -polarised , we attribute this shg feature to the excitation of the monopole sphp mode in the nanopillars . in general , the outgoing shg field is related to the incident electromagnetic fields via the so - called local field factors : where is the nonlinear polarisation and is the nonlinear susceptibility tensor . the excitation of the sphp monopole mode leads to strong localization of the z -projection of the fundamental electric field ( normal to the surface plane ) and thus a resonant enhancement of . the latter results in a pronounced increase of the shg output when the fundamental radiation is p -polarised . however , the sphp dipole modes observed in the range of 920960 rely on the resonant enhancement of the in - plane electric fields described by the local field factors and thus can be excited with both p - and s -polarised fundamental radiation . the total shg response is given by a vector sum of the terms on the right hand side of eq . ( 1 ) originating from various tensor components of the nonlinear susceptibility . as the strength of is the largest in this spectral range , the sphp monopole mode , with an enhancement of , naturally results in a higher shg output than the dipole modes . the results of the systematic studies of the shg response of various arrays of nanopillars are summarized in fig . for the 4h - sic ( a , c ) and 6h - sic ( b , d ) samples . the panels ( a - b ) illustrate the evolution of the shg spectra upon varying pillar diameter . it is seen that upon decreasing , the sphp monopole - driven shg peak exhibits a clear redshift . remarkably , while the sphp monopole mode shifts in the range of about 890 - 910 , the shg enhancement factor associated with the excitation of the sphp monopole mode varies strongly with . the panels ( c - d ) offer a zoom - in into the evolution of the sphp monopole mode - driven shg for a large variety of nanopillar arrays , indicating that the variations of the shg enhancement are observed for both 4h and 6h samples . the dependences of the sphp monopole - driven shg output on the spectral position of the sphp monopole mode for the two sic polytypes are shown in fig . ,a with open symbols . = 1200 , 1100 and 1000 nm , respectively . , scaledwidth=47.0% ] the strong dispersion in the sic reststrahlen band suggests that the observed spectral dependence of the shg enhancement could be captured in numerical simulations . we calculated shg response using both linear and nonlinear sic dispersion , the results of the simulation of the linear optical response , and nonlinear polarization from eq . ( 1 ) spatially integrated over the sic volume , with the following non - zero components of the nonlinear susceptibility : , and . the resultant shg spectra simulated with comsol multiphysics software ( www.comsol.com ) are shown in fig . ,b with full symbols . it is seen that the steep experimental dependence can not be quantitatively described within the simple model used in the calculations , which yields only a moderate increase of the shg output when the sphp monopole mode frequency is decreased . we note the work of carpetti et al . where the authors thoroughly examined plasmon - induced shg enhancement from arrays of au nanoparticles as a function of the inter - particle distance . in the regime of ( as it is in our case ) , the dependence of the shg output on was explained in terms of the changing filling factor ( and thus the associated number of active nanoemitters ) . for very small inter - particle gaps  , a modulation of the shg output has been attributed to the modification of the electromagnetic field localization in the gaps . further , a large mismatch between the spatial period of the nanopillars and the resonant light wavelength rules out the excitation of propagating surface polaritons which are known to enhance the shg output . since all these effects are included in our simulations , we conclude that the origin of the observed shg enhancement is unrelated to the periodicity of the array . an alternative scenario for the observed trend could invoke modifications of the non - local shg contribution enhanced by a regular array structure . the importance of the non - local shg was already demonstrated in a number of subwavelength - separated plasmonic nanoobjects . the amplitude and phase of this non - local shg source depends on the electric field distribution , i.e. on both the pillar size and the periodicity . as such , the interference conditions between the shg sources vary for different samples , thus resulting in a strong modification of the shg output . further , the apparent difference in the shape of the resonant shg output for the 4h and 6h samples ( see fig . ) is related to the anisotropic nature of sic . the hexagonal sic polytypes are known to exhibit zone - folded weak modes in the reststrahlen region originating from particular stacking of the atomic layers along the c -axis of the crystal . these weakly ir - active zone - folded modes can be visualised in the reflectivity measurements at oblique incidence . although zone - folded modes exist in both 4h and 6h polytypes , different stacking of the sic atomic layers is responsible for them having different frequencies , as illustrated in fig . ,c - d . the additional periodicity in the crystal results in folding of the large brillouin zone thus modifying the phonon dispersion and making the excitation of phonons with non - zero wavevectors  possible . it is seen in fig . ,d that the zone - folded mode in the 6h - sic polytype with the reduced wavevector can be excited in the range of which is close to the typical monopole sphp resonant frequency of the sic nanopillars discussed above . in particular , the interaction of the sphp and zone - folded mode which shifted the apparent spectral positions of the monopole sphp eigenmode in the linear response , is seen responsible for the complex structure of the resonant shg output in our experiments ( fig . ,d ) . the weak ir activity of the zone - folded modes is related to the large negative dielectric permittivity of sic in the reststrahlen band . as such , the out - of - plane component of the electromagnetic field remains small which inhibits the coupling of incident light to the zone - folded phonon mode . however , the excitation of the sphp monopole mode in the nanopillars drives a strong increase of , which facilitates the sphp monopole interaction with the zone - folded phonon ( fig . ,c ) . figure ,a illustrates the effect of the zone - folded mode on the observed shg output . the open red squares ( 4h ) and blue circles ( 6h ) depict the shg intensity obtained at the sphp monopole ( resonant ) frequencies , and the dashed lines illustrate a clear correlation between the maximum shg output and the spectral position of the sphp monopole peak . similar trends are observed for the 4h and 6h - sic samples as long as the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode are well - separated . when these two resonances start to overlap , an additional enhancement of the shg output produced at the sphp monopole resonance in 6h - sic samples is observed . moreover , the dependence of the shg signal at the frequency of the zone - folded mode ( green triangles ) exhibits a much faster increase when the two resonances are brought together ( dotted line ) , indicating an efficient interplay between the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode . we note that the interaction of the localized sphp eigenmodes and the intrinsic excitations of the medium is a unique fingerprint of mid - ir nanophononics . indeed , surface plasmon excitations in metals rely on the free electron gas , which is essentially isotropic . as such , the shg output of plasmonic nanostructures is ( i ) largely determined by the metal of choice , usually au , ( ii ) exhibits only weak spectral dependence and ( iii ) is limited by robust phase relations in the likely case of multiple shg sources . on the contrary , the flexibility of the sphps is provided by the coupling of the surface phonon polariton excitations to the intrinsic bulk phonon modes . the latter can be engineered by designing artificial metamaterials based on hybrid multilayer structures , thus allowing for an effective control of their optical properties . to summarize , we have observed shg output enhancement associated with the excitation of the sphp eigenmodes in an array of nanopillars grown from sic of different polytypes . the strongest shg output is associated with the excitation of the monopole sphp mode characterized by strong localization of the normal to surface projection of the electric field . the spectral positions of the shg peaks shift according to the geometric parameters of the nanophononic structures . we found a strong dependence of the magnitude of the shg enhancement on the resonant frequency . this experimentally observed dependence can not be quantitatively described by simply taking into account the sub - diffractional field localization and the dispersion of the linear and nonlinear optical properties of sic . further , we discuss the interplay of the sphps and the intrinsic crystalline anisotropy for an efficient nonlinear - optical conversion . this mechanism is supported by the shg spectral measurements on the 6h - sic nanopillars where excitation of the sphp monopole mode interacting with the weak zone - folded phonon resulted in an additional enhancement of the shg output . the presence of intrinsic resonances strongly alters the phase relations in their vicinity , providing a natural way for optimizing the shg response in a relatively narrow spectral range . our findings demonstrate high potential of mid -

{"article": "with significant research efforts being directed to the development of neurocomputers based on the functionalities of the brain , a seismic shift is expected in the domain of computing based on the traditional von - neumann model . the , and the ibm are instances of recent flagship neuromorphic projects that aim to develop brain - inspired computing platforms suitable for recognition ( image , video , speech ) , classification and mining problems . while boolean computation is based on the sequential fetch , decode and execute cycles , such neuromorphic computing architectures are massively parallel and event - driven and are potentially appealing for pattern recognition tasks and cortical brain simulations to that end , researchers have proposed various nanoelectronic devices where the underlying device physics offer a mapping to the neuronal and synaptic operations performed in the brain . the main motivation behind the usage of such non - von neumann post - cmos technologies as neural and synaptic devices stems from the fact that the significant mismatch between the cmos transistors and the underlying neuroscience mechanisms result in significant area and energy overhead for a corresponding hardware implementation . a very popular instance is the simulation of a cat s brain on ibm s blue gene supercomputer where the power consumption was reported to be of the order of a few . while the power required to simulate the human brain will rise significantly as we proceed along the hierarchy in the animal kingdom , actual power consumption in the mammalian brain is just a few tens of watts . in a neuromorphic computing platform , synapses form the pathways between neurons and their strength modulate the magnitude of the signal transmitted between the neurons . the exact mechanisms that underlie the `` learning '' or `` plasticity '' of such synaptic connections are still under debate . meanwhile , researchers have attempted to mimic several plasticity measurements observed in biological synapses in nanoelectronic devices like phase change memories , memristors and spintronic devices , etc . however , majority of the research have focused on non - volatile plasticity changes of the synapse in response to the spiking patterns of the neurons it connects corresponding to long - term plasticity and the volatility of human memory has been largely ignored . as a matter of fact , neuroscience studies performed in have demonstrated that synapses exhibit an inherent learning ability where they undergo volatile plasticity changes and ultimately undergo long - term plasticity conditionally based on the frequency of the incoming action potentials . such volatile or meta - stable synaptic plasticity mechanisms can lead to neuromorphic architectures where the synaptic memory can adapt itself to a changing environment since sections of the memory that have been not receiving frequent stimulus can be now erased and utilized to memorize more frequent information . hence , it is necessary to include such volatile memory transition functionalities in a neuromorphic chip in order to leverage from the computational power that such meta - stable synaptic plasticity mechanisms has to offer . ( a ) demonstrates the biological process involved in such volatile synaptic plasticity changes . during the transmission of each action potential from the pre - neuron to the post - neuron through the synapse , an influx of ionic species like and causes the release of neurotransmitters from the pre- to the post - neuron . this results in temporary strengthening of the synaptic strength . however , in absence of the action potential , the ionic species concentration settles down to its equilibrium value and the synapse strength diminishes . this phenomenon is termed as short - term plasticity ( stp ) . however , if the action potentials occur frequently , the concentration of the ions do not get enough time to settle down to the equilibrium concentration and this buildup of concentration eventually results in long - term strengthening of the synaptic junction . this phenomenon is termed as long - term potentiation ( ltp ) . while stp is a meta - stable state and lasts for a very small time duration , ltp is a stable synaptic state which can last for hours , days or even years . a similar discussion is valid for the case where there is a long - term reduction in synaptic strength with frequent stimulus and then the phenomenon is referred to as long - term depression ( ltd ) . such stp and ltp mechanisms have been often correlated to the short - term memory ( stm ) and long - term memory ( ltm ) models proposed by atkinson and shiffrin ( fig . (b ) ) . this psychological model partitions the human memory into an stm and an ltm . on the arrival of an input stimulus , information is first stored in the stm . however , upon frequent rehearsal , information gets transferred to the ltm . while the `` forgetting '' phenomena occurs at a fast rate in the stm , information can be stored for a much longer duration in the ltm . in order to mimic such volatile synaptic plasticity mechanisms , a nanoelectronic device is required that is able to undergo meta - stable resistance transitions depending on the frequency of the input and also transition to a long - term stable resistance state on frequent stimulations . hence a competition between synaptic memory reinforcement or strengthening and memory loss is a crucial requirement for such nanoelectronic synapses . in the next section , we will describe the mapping of the magnetization dynamics of a nanomagnet to such volatile synaptic plasticity mechanisms observed in the brain . let us first describe the device structure and principle of operation of an mtj as shown in fig . (a ) . the device consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a tunneling oxide barrier ( tb ) . the magnetization of one of the layers is magnetically `` pinned '' and hence it is termed as the `` pinned '' layer ( pl ) . the magnetization of the other layer , denoted as the `` free layer '' ( fl ) , can be manipulated by an incoming spin current . the mtj structure exhibits two extreme stable conductive states the low conductive `` anti - parallel '' orientation ( ap ) , where pl and fl magnetizations are oppositely directed and the high conductive `` parallel '' orientation ( p ) , where the magnetization of the two layers are in the same direction . let us consider that the initial state of the mtj synapse is in the low conductive ap state . considering the input stimulus ( current ) to flow from terminal t2 to terminal t1 , electrons will flow from terminal t1 to t2 and get spin - polarized by the pl of the mtj . subsequently , these spin - polarized electrons will try to orient the fl of the mtj `` parallel '' to the pl . it is worth noting here that the spin - polarization of incoming electrons in the mtj is analogous to the release of neurotransmitters in a biological synapse . the stp and ltp mechanisms exhibited in the mtj due to the spin - polarization of the incoming electrons can be explained by the energy profile of the fl of the mtj . let the angle between the fl magnetization , , and the pl magnetization , , be denoted by . the fl energy as a function of has been shown in fig . (a ) where the two energy minima points ( and ) are separated by the energy barrier , . during the transition from the ap state to the p state , the fl has to transition from to . upon the receipt of an input stimulus , the fl magnetization proceeds `` uphill '' along the energy profile ( from initial point 1 to point 2 in fig . (a ) ) . however , since point 2 is a meta - stable state , it starts going `` downhill '' to point 1 , once the stimulus is removed . if the input stimulus is not frequent enough , the fl will try to stabilize back to the ap state after each stimulus . however , if the stimulus is frequent , the fl will not get sufficient time to reach point 1 and ultimately will be able to overcome the energy barrier ( point 3 in fig . (a ) ) . it is worth noting here , that on crossing the energy barrier at , it becomes progressively difficult for the mtj to exhibit stp and switch back to the initial ap state . this is in agreement with the psychological model of human memory where it becomes progressively difficult for the memory to `` forget '' information during transition from stm to ltm . hence , once it has crossed the energy barrier , it starts transitioning from the stp to the ltp state ( point 4 in fig . (a ) ) . the stability of the mtj in the ltp state is dictated by the magnitude of the energy barrier . the lifetime of the ltp state is exponentially related to the energy barrier . for instance , for an energy barrier of used in this work , the ltp lifetime is hours while the lifetime can be extended to around years by engineering a barrier height of . the lifetime can be varied by varying the energy barrier , or equivalently , volume of the mtj . the stp - ltp behavior of the mtj can be also explained from the magnetization dynamics of the fl described by landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation with additional term to account for the spin momentum torque according to slonczewski , where , is the unit vector of fl magnetization , is the gyromagnetic ratio for electron , is gilberts damping ratio , is the effective magnetic field including the shape anisotropy field for elliptic disks calculated using , is the number of spins in free layer of volume ( is saturation magnetization and is bohr magneton ) , and is the spin current generated by the input stimulus ( is the spin - polarization efficiency of the pl ) . thermal noise is included by an additional thermal field , , where is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation , is boltzmann constant , is the temperature and is the simulation time step . equation can be reformulated by simple algebraic manipulations as , hence , in the presence of an input stimulus the magnetization of the fl starts changing due to integration of the input . however , in the absence of the input , it starts leaking back due to the first two terms in the rhs of the above equation . it is worth noting here that , like traditional semiconductor memories , magnitude and duration of the input stimulus will definitely have an impact on the stp - ltp transition of the synapse . however , frequency of the input is a critical factor in this scenario . even though the total flux through the device is same , the synapse will conditionally change its state if the frequency of the input is high . we verified that this functionality is exhibited in mtjs by performing llg simulations ( including thermal noise ) . the conductance of the mtj as a function of can be described by , where ,  is the mtj conductance in the p ( ap ) orientation respectively . as shown in fig . (b ) , the mtj conductance undergoes meta - stable transitions ( stp ) and is not able to undergo ltp when the time interval of the input pulses is large  . however , on frequent stimulations with time interval as , the device undergoes ltp transition incrementally . (b ) and ( c ) illustrates the competition between memory reinforcement and memory decay in an mtj structure that is crucial to implement stp and ltp in the synapse . we demonstrate simulation results to verify the stp and ltp mechanisms in an mtj synapse depending on the time interval between stimulations . the device simulation parameters were obtained from experimental measurements and have been shown in table i. table i. device simulation parameters + the mtj was subjected to 10 stimulations , each stimulation being a current pulse of magnitude and in duration . as shown in fig . , the probability of ltp transition and average device conductance at the end of each stimulation increases with decrease in the time interval between the stimulations . the dependence on stimulation time interval can be further characterized by measurements corresponding to paired - pulse facilitation ( ppf : synaptic plasticity increase when a second stimulus follows a previous similar stimulus ) and post - tetanic potentiation ( ptp : progressive synaptic plasticity increment when a large number of such stimuli are received successively ) . depicts such ppf ( after 2nd stimulus ) and ptp ( after 10th stimulus ) measurements for the mtj synapse with variation in the stimulation interval . the measurements closely resemble measurements performed in frog neuromuscular junctions where ppf measurements revealed that there was a small synaptic conductivity increase when the stimulation rate was frequent enough while ptp measurements indicated ltp transition on frequent stimulations with a fast decay in synaptic conductivity on decrement in the stimulation rate . hence , stimulation rate indeed plays a critical role in the mtj synapse to determine the probability of ltp transition . the psychological model of stm and ltm utilizing such mtj synapses was further explored in a memory array . the array was stimulated by a binary image of the purdue university logo where a set of 5 pulses ( each of magnitude and in duration ) was applied for each on pixel . the snapshots of the conductance values of the memory array after each stimulus have been shown for two different stimulation intervals of and respectively . while the memory array attempts to remember the displayed image right after stimulation , it fails to transition to ltm for the case and the information is eventually lost after stimulation . however , information gets transferred to ltm progressively for . it is worth noting here , that the same amount of flux is transmitted through the mtj in both cases . the simulation not only provides a visual depiction of the temporal evolution of a large array of mtj conductances as a function of stimulus but also provides inspiration for the realization of adaptive neuromorphic systems exploiting the concepts of stm and ltm . readers interested in the practical implementation of such arrays of spintronic devices are referred to ref . the contributions of this work over state - of - the - art approaches may be summarized as follows . this is the first theoretical demonstration of stp and ltp mechanisms in an mtj synapse . we demonstrated the mapping of neurotransmitter release in a biological synapse to the spin polarization of electrons in an mtj and performed extensive simulations to illustrate the impact of stimulus frequency on the ltp probability in such an mtj structure . there have been recent proposals of other emerging devices that can exhibit such stp - ltp mechanisms like synapses and memristors . however , it is worth noting here , that input stimulus magnitudes are usually in the range of volts ( 1.3v in and 80mv in ) and stimulus durations are of the order of a few msecs ( 1ms in and 0.5s in ) . in contrast , similar mechanisms can be exhibited in mtj synapses at much lower energy consumption ( by stimulus magnitudes of a few hundred and duration of a few ) . we believe that this work will stimulate proof - of - concept experiments to realize such mtj synapses that can potentially pave the way for future ultra - low power intelligent neuromorphic systems capable of adaptive learning . the work was supported in part by , center for spintronic materials , interfaces , and novel architectures ( c -

volatile long - term plasticity changes have been implemented in nanoelectronic synapses for neuromorphic applications , recent studies in neuroscience have revealed that biological synapses undergo meta - stable volatile strengthening followed by a long - term strengthening provided that the frequency of the input stimulus is sufficiently high . such `` memory strengthening '' and `` memory decay '' functionalities can potentially lead to adaptive neuromorphic architectures . in this paper , we demonstrate the close resemblance of the magnetization dynamics of a magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) to short - term plasticity and long - term potentiation observed in biological synapses . we illustrate that , in addition to the magnitude and duration of the input stimulus , frequency of the stimulus plays a critical role in determining long - term potentiation of the mtj . such mtj synaptic memory arrays can be utilized to create compact , ultra - fast and low power intelligent neural systems ."}
{"article": "the segmentation process as a whole can be thought of as consisting of two tasks : recognition and delineation . recognition is to determine roughly `` where '' the object is and to distinguish it from other object - like entities . although delineation is the final step for defining the spatial extent of the object region / boundary in the image , an efficient recognition strategy is a key for successful delineation . in this study , a novel , general method is introduced for object recognition to assist in segmentation ( delineation ) tasks . it exploits the pose relationship that can be encoded , via the concept of ball scale ( b - scale ) , between the binary training objects and their associated images . as an alternative to the manual methods based on initial placement of the models by an expert in the literature , model based methods can be employed for recognition . for example , in , the position of an organ model ( such as liver ) is estimated by its histogram . in , generalized hough transform is succesfully extended to incorporate variability of shape for 2d segmentation problem . atlas based methods are also used to define initial position for a shape model . in , affine registration is performed to align the data into an atlas to determine the initial position for a shape model of the knee cartilage . similarly , a popular particle filtering algorithm is used to detect the starting pose of models for both single and multi - object cases . however , due to the large search space and numerous local minimas in most of these studies , conducting a global search on the entire image is not a feasible approach . in this paper , we investigate an approach of automatically recognizing objects in 3d images without performing elaborate searches or optimization . the proposed method consists of the following key ideas and components : * 1 . model building : * after aligning image data from all subjects in the training set into a common coordinate system via 7-parameter affine registration , the live - wire algorithm is used to segment different objects from subjects . segmented objects are used for the automatic extraction of landmarks in a slice - by - slice manner . from the landmark information for all objects , a model assembly is constructed . b - scale encoding : * the b - scale value at every voxel in an image helps to understand `` objectness '' of a given image without doing explicit segmentation . for each voxel , the radius of the largest ball of homogeneous intensity is weighted by the intensity value of that particular voxel in order to incorporate appearance ( texture ) information into the object information ( called intensity weighted b - scale : ) so that a model of the correlations between shape and texture can be built . a simple and proper way of thresholding the b - scale image yields a few largest balls remaining in the image . these are used for the construction of the relationship between the segmented training objects and the corresponding images . the resulting images have a strong relationship with the actual delineated objects . relationship between and : * a principal component system is built via pca for the segmented objects in each image , and their mean system , denoted , is found over all training images . has an origin and three axes . similarly the mean system , denoted , for intensity weighted b - scale images is found . finally the transformation that maps to is found . given an image to be segmented , the main idea here is to use to facilitate a quick placement of in with a proper pose as indicated in step 4 below . * hierarchical recognition : * for a given image , is obtained and its system , denoted is computed subsequently . assuming the relationship of to to be the same as of to , and assuming that offers the proper pose of in the training images , we use transformation and to determine the pose of in . this level of recognition is called coarse recognition . further refinement of the recognition can be done using the skin boundary object in the image with the requirement that a major portion of should lie inside the body region delimited by the skin boundary . moreover , a little search inside the skin boundary can be done for the fine tuning , however , since offered coarse recognition method gives high recognition rates , there is no need to do any elaborate searches . we will focus on the fine tuning of coarse recognition for future study . the finest level of recognition requires the actual delineation algorithm itself , which is a hybrid method in our case and called gc - asm ( synergistic integration of graph - cut and active shape model ) . this delineation algorithm is presented in a companion paper submitted to this symposium . a convenient way of achieving incorporation of prior information automatically in computing systems is to create and use a flexible model to encode information such as the expected size , shape , appearance , and position of objects in an image . among such information , shape and appearance are two complementary but closely related attributes of biological structures in images , and hence they are often used to create statistical models . in particular , shape has been used both in high and low level image analysis tasks extensively , and it has been demonstrated that shape models ( such as active shape models ( asms ) ) can be quite powerful in compensating for misleading information due to noise , poor resolution , clutter , and occlusion in the images . therefore , we use asm to estimate population statistics from a set of examples ( training set ) . in order to guarantee 3d point correspondences required by asm , we build our statistical shape models combining semi - automatic methods : ( 1 ) manually selected anatomically correspondent slices by an expert , and ( 2 ) semi - automatic way of specifying key points on the shapes starting from the same anatomical locations . once step ( 1 ) is accomplished , the remaining problem turns into a problem of establishing point correspondence in 2d shapes , which is easily solved . it is extremely significant to choose correct correspondences so that a good representation of the modelled object results . although landmark correspondence is usually established manually by experts , it is time - consuming , prone to errors , and restricted to only 2d objects . because of these limitations , a semi - automatic landmark tagging method , equal space landmarking , is used to establish correspondence between landmarks of each sample shape in our experiments . although this method is proposed for 2d objects , and equally spacing a fixed number of points for 3d objects is much more difficult , we use equal space landmarking technique in pseudo-3d manner where 3d object is annotated slice by slice . let be a single shape and assume that its finite dimensional representation after the landmarking consisting of landmark points with positions , where are cartesian coordinates of the point on the shape . equal space landmark tagging for points for on shape boundaries ( contours ) starts by selecting an initial point on each shape sample in training set and equally space a fixed number of points on each boundary automatically . selecting the starting point has been done manually by annotating the same anatomical point for each shape in the training set . figure shows annotated landmarks for five different objects ( skin , liver , right kidney , left kidney , spleen ) in a ct slice of the abdominal region . note that different number of landmarks are used for different objects considering their size . \\(1 ) the b - scale image of a given image captures object morphometric information without requiring explicit segmentation . b - scales constitute fundamental units of an image in terms of largest homogeneous balls situated at every voxel in the image . the b - scale concept has been previously used in object delineation , filtering and registration . our results suggest that their ability to capture object geography in conjunction with shape models may be useful in quick and simple yet accurate object recognition strategies . ( 2 ) the presented method is general and does not depend on exploiting the peculiar characteristics of the application situation . ( 3 ) the specificity of recognition increases dramatically as the number of objects in the model increases . ( 4 ) we emphasize that both modeling and testing procedures are carried out on the ct data sets that are part of the clinical pet / ct data routinely acquired in our hospital . the ct data set are thus of relatively poor ( spatial and contrast ) resolution compared to other ct - alone studies with or without contrast . we expect better performance if higher resolution ct data are employed in modeling or testing . this paper is published in spie medical imaging conference - 2010 . falcao , a.x . , udupa , j.k . , samarasekera , s. , sharma , s. , hirsch , b.e . , and lotufo , r.a . , 1998 user - steered image segmentation paradigms : live wire and live lane . graph . models image process . 60 ( 4 ) , pp . 233260 . kokkinos , i. , maragos , p. , 2009 . synergy between object recognition and image segmentation using the expectation - maximization algorithm . ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligience , vol.31 ( 8) , pp.14861501 . brejl , m. , sonka , m. , 2000 . object localization and border detection criteria design in edge - based image segmentation : automated learning from examples . ieee transactions on medical imaging , vol.19 ( 10 ) , pp.973985 . fripp , j. , crozier , s. , warfield , s.k . , ourselin , s. , 2005 . automatic initialisation of 3d deformable models for cartilage segmentation . in proceedings of digital image computing : techniques and applications , pp .", "summary": "this paper investigates , using prior shape models and the concept of ball scale ( b - scale ) , ways of automatically recognizing objects in 3d images without performing elaborate searches or optimization . that is , the goal is to place the model in a single shot close to the right pose ( position , orientation , and scale ) in a given image so that the model boundaries fall in the close vicinity of object boundaries in the image . this is achieved via the following set of key ideas : ( a ) a semi - automatic way of constructing a multi - object shape model assembly .

{"article": "one surprising result that has come out of the more than 200 extrasolar planet discoveries to date is the wide range of eccentricities observed . unlike our own solar system , many of the extrasolar planets which are not tidally locked to their host stars have moderate eccentricities  , and 15 planets have high eccentricities  . these observations have spawned several theories as to the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets . one such method , planet - planet scattering , occurs when multiple jovian planets form several astronomical units ( au ) from the host star and then interact , leaving one in an eccentric orbit and often ejecting the other . this method has been proposed to explain the architecture of the and planetary system , which contains a hot jupiter as well as two jovian planets in moderately eccentric orbits . suggested a merger scenario in which inner protoplanets perturb each other and merge to form a single massive , eccentric planet with and au . interactions with stellar companions are another possible way to boost a planet s eccentricity . of the 15 stars hosting a planet with , six are also known to possess stellar - mass companions in wide binary orbits : hd 3651 , hd 20782 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 , 16 cyg b , and hd 222582 . if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large , the kozai mechanism can induce large - amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the planet ( e.g. malmberg et al . these oscillations can be damped by general relativistic effects and by interaction with other planets , and hence are most effective in systems with a single planet in an orbit au from the host star . the kozai mechanism has been suggested to explain the high eccentricity of 16 cyg bb and hd 80606b . found the inclination of 16 cyg b orbiting the system barycenter to lie between 100 and 160 degrees , where 90 degrees is an edge - on orientation . however , it is the difference in inclination between the orbital planes of the planetary and stellar companion that is critical in determining the importance of the kozai mechanism , and the inclination of the planet s orbit is generally not known for non - transiting systems . of the 192 known planetary systems , 23 ( 12% ) are multi - planet systems . recent discoveries of additional objects in systems known to host at least one planet suggest that multiple - planet systems are common . of particular interest are systems which host a jovian planet and a low - mass `` hot neptune , '' e.g. 55 cnc ( = hd 75732 ) , gj 876 , arae ( = hd 160691 ) , gl 777a ( = hd 190360 ) . motivated by the discoveries of hot neptunes in known planetary systems , we have undertaken an intensive survey of selected single - planet systems to search for additional low - mass companions . three of the planetary systems discussed in this paper ( hd 3651 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) are part of this campaign . the excellent radial - velocity precision of the high resolution spectrograph on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , combined with queue - scheduling , allow us to time the observations in such a way as to minimize phase gaps in the orbit of the known planet , and also to act quickly on potential new planet candidates . the use of the het in this manner is discussed further in with regard to the discovery of hd 37605b . in this work , we aim to combine observational limits on additional planets in known planetary systems with dynamical constraints obtained by n - body simulations . the observations address the question : what additional planets are ( or are not ) in these systems ? the dynamical simulations can answer the question : where are additional planets possible ? section 2 describes the observations and the test particle simulations for six highly eccentric planetary systems : hd 3651 , hd 37605 , hd 45350 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 , and 16 cyg b. we have chosen these systems based on two criteria : ( 1 ) each hosts a planet with , and ( 2 ) each has been observed by the planet search programs at mcdonald observatory . in 3 , we present and discuss the results of the updated orbital fits , dynamical simulations , and detection limit computations . five of the six stars considered in this work have been observed with the mcdonald observatory 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) using its high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) . a full description of the het planet search program is given in . for 16 cyg b , observations from mcdonald observatory were obtained only with the 2.7 m harlan j. smith ( hjs ) telescope ; the long - term planet search program on this telescope is described in . all available published data on these systems were combined with our data from mcdonald observatory in the orbit fitting procedures . to place constraints on the architecture of planetary systems , we would like to know where additional objects can remain in stable orbits in the presence of the known planet(s ) . we performed test particle simulations using swifthal / swift.html . ] to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low - mass planets in each of the six systems considered here . low - mass planets can be treated as test particles since the exchange of angular momentum with jovian planets is small . we chose the regularized mixed - variable symplectic integrator ( rmvs3 ) version of swift for its ability to handle close approaches between massless , non - interacting test particles and planets . particles are removed if they are ( 1 ) closer than 1 hill radius to the planet , ( 2 ) closer than 0.05 au to the star , or ( 3 ) farther than 10 au from the star . since the purpose of these simulations is to determine the regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits , we set this outer boundary because the current repository of radial - velocity data can not detect objects at such distances . the test particle simulations were set up following the methods used in , with the exception that only initially circular orbits are considered in this work . for each planetary system , test particles were placed in initially circular orbits spaced every 0.002 au in the region between 0.05 - 2.0 au . we have chosen to focus on this region because the duration of our high - precision het data is currently only 2 - 4 years for the objects in this study . the test particles were coplanar with the existing planet , which had the effect of confining the simulation to two dimensions . input physical parameters for the known planet in each system were obtained from our keplerian orbit fits described in 3.1 , and from recent literature for 16 cyg b and hd 45350 . the planetary masses were taken to be their minimum values ( sin ) . the systems were integrated for yr , following and allowing completion of the computations in a reasonable time . we observed that nearly all of the test - particle removals occurred within the first yr ; after this time , the simulations had essentially stabilized to their final configurations . we present updated keplerian orbital solutions for hd 3651b , hd 37605b , hd 80606b , and hd 89744b in table 1 . a summary of the data used in our analysis is given in table 2 , and the het radial velocities are given in tables 3 - 6 . the velocity uncertainties given for the het data represent internal errors only , and do not include any external sources of error such as stellar `` jitter . '' the parameters for the remaining two planets , hd 45350b and 16 cyg bb , are taken from and , respectively . radial velocity measurements from the het are given for hd 45350 in , and velocities for 16 cyg b from the hjs telescope are given in . as in , all available published data were combined with those from mcdonald , and the known planet in each system was fit with a keplerian orbit using gaussfit , allowing the velocity offset between each data set to be a free parameter . examination of the residuals to our keplerian orbit fits revealed no evidence for additional objects in any of the six systems in this study . the saturn - mass ( m sin ) planet hd 3651b was discovered by using observations from lick and keck . we fit these data , which were updated in , in combination with observations from the hjs and het at mcdonald observatory . the het data , which consist of multiple exposures per visit , were binned using the inverse - variance weighted mean value of the velocities in each visit . the standard error of the mean was added in quadrature to the weighted rms about the mean velocity to generate the error bar of each binned point ( n=29 ) . the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick & keck6.6 , het9.4 , hjs12.2 . the fitted orbital parameters for hd 3651b are of comparable precision to those reported in , and agree within 2 . the recent discovery of a t dwarf companion to hd 3651 prompts an interesting exercise : can the radial - velocity trend due to this object be detected in the residuals after removing the planet ? we detect a slope of yr , indicating that we are indeed able to discern a trend which is possibly due to the binary companion . however , the reduced of the orbital solution is not significantly improved by the inclusion of a linear trend ( =0.18 ) . the parameters given in table 1 were obtained from the fit which did not include a trend . we present 23 new het observations for hd 37605 obtained since its announcement by . the data now span a total of 1065 days . the best fit is obtained by including an acceleration of yr , indicating a distant orbiting body . such a finding would lend support to the hypothesis that very eccentric single - planet systems originate by interactions within a wide binary system . the shortest period that this outer companion could have and still remain consistent with the observed acceleration and its uncertainty over the timespan of the observations is about 40 yr , assuming a circular orbit . this object would then have a minimum mass in the brown dwarf range . the planet orbiting hd 80606 , first announced by , is the most eccentric extrasolar planet known , with ( table 1 ) . we have fit the coralie data in combination with the keck data given in and 23 observations from het . the extreme velocity variations induced by this planet greatly increase the sensitivity of orbit fits to the weighting of individual measurements . since the uncertainties of the het velocities given in tables 3 - 6 represent internal errors only , we experimented with adding 1 - 7 of radial - velocity `` jitter '' in quadrature before fitting the data for hd 80606 . for all of these jitter values , the fitted parameters remained the same within their uncertainties . table 1 gives the parameters derived from a fit which added 3.5 of jitter to the het data . the rms about the combined fit is : coralie18.7 , het7.5 , keck5.6 . noted that the eccentricity and the argument of periastron had to be held fixed in their fit to the keck data alone . however , the large number of measurements included in this work allowed gaussfit to converge with all parameters free . for hd 89744b , we combine data from the het with 6 measurements from the hjs telescope and lick data from . the het data were binned in the same manner as for hd 3651 , resulting in n=33 independent visits . the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick17.1 , het10.7 , hjs9.5 . as with hd 3651b , our derived parameters agree with those of within 2 . the scatter about our fit remains large , most likely due to the star s early spectral type ( f7v ) , which hinders precision radial - velocity measurements due to the smaller number of spectral lines . for example , the f7v star hd 221287 was recently found to host a planet ; despite the superb instrumental precision of the harps spectrograph , that orbital solution has a residual rms of 8.5 . the results of the dynamical simulations are shown in figures 1 - 3 . the survival time of the test particles is plotted against their initial semimajor axis . as shown in figure 1 , the short - period planets hd 3651 and hd 37605 sweep clean the region inside of about 0.5 au . in both of these systems , however , a small number of test particles remained in low - eccentricity orbits near the known planet s apastron distance , near the 1:2 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) . in the hd 3651 system , particles remained stable beyond about 0.6 au , which is not surprising given the low mass of the planet . for hd 37605 , two distinct strips of stability are seen in fig . 1 , corresponding to the 1:2 and 1:3 mmrs . the eccentricity of the test particles in the region of the 1:2 mmr oscillated between 0.00 and 0.06 . particles in 1:3 mmr oscillated in eccentricity with a larger range , up to , which is expected due to secular forcing . as with hd 3651 , the region beyond about 0.8 au was essentially unaffected by the planet . figure 2 shows the results for the hd 45350 and hd 80606 systems . the long period ( 963.6 days ) and relatively large mass ( m sin =1.8 ) of hd 45350b restricted stable orbits to the innermost 0.2 au . these test particles oscillated in eccentricity up to . the 4 planet orbiting hd 80606 removed all test particles to a distance of about 1.5 au , and only beyond 1.75 au did test particles remain in stable orbits for the duration of the simulation ( yr ) . a region of instability is evident at 1.9 au due to the 8:1 mmr . figure 3 shows that hd 89744b eliminated all test particles except for a narrow region near the 8:3 resonance . for the 16 cyg b system , only particles inside of about 0.3 au remained stable , leaving open the possibility of short - period planets . the surviving particles oscillated in eccentricity up to , but these simulations treat the star as a point mass , and hence tidal damping of the eccentricity is not included . our results are consistent with those of , who investigated dynamical stability in extrasolar planetary systems and found that no test particles survived in the habitable zones of the hd 80606 , hd 89744 , and 16 cyg b systems . three of these systems ( hd 3651 , hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) were monitored intensely with the het as part of a larger effort to search for low - mass , short period planets . no evidence was found for any such objects in these or any of the six systems in this work . we then asked what limits can be set on additional planets using the high - precision het data we have obtained . the procedure for determining companion limits was identical to the method described in , except that in this work , the best - fit keplerian orbit for the known planet ( see 3.1 ) was removed before performing the limits computations . in this way , we determined the radial - velocity amplitude for which 99% of planets would have been detected in the residuals . the eccentricity of the injected test signals was chosen to be the mean eccentricity of the surviving particles from the simulations described in 3.2 . only the regions in which test particles survived were considered in these limits computations . the results of these computations were highly varied , reflecting the differing observing strategies employed for these six objects . in particular , hd 3651 , hd 80606 , and hd 89744 were monitored intensely with the het as part of a search for short - period objects , whereas hd 37605 and hd 45350 were only observed sporadically after the known planet orbits were defined and published , and 16 cyg b has only been observed with the hjs telescope at a frequency of at most once per month . the companion limits are shown in figures 4 - 6 ; planets with masses above the solid line can be ruled out by the data with 99% confidence . not surprisingly , the tightest limits were obtained for hd 3651 ( figure 4 ) , which had a total of 195 measurements , including 29 independent het visits . for periods less than about 1 year , we can exclude planets with m sin 2 neptune masses . similar results were obtained for 16 cyg b ( n=161 ) , where the limits approach a neptune mass ( figure 6 ) . since the detection limits generally improve with the addition of more data and with higher - quality data , we can define a quantity to measure the goodness of the limits . a simple choice would be , where is the total number of observations , and is the mean uncertainty of the radial - velocity measurements . the values of and are given in table 2 . in the hd 45350 system , the results of the dynamical simulations complement those of the detection limit determinations . very tight limits are obtained in close orbits ( .2 au ) . in this region , test particles were stable ( fig . 2 ) and our observations can exclude planets with m sin i between about 1 and 4 neptune masses . similar results were obtained for the 16 cyg b system , in which test particles remained stable inward of 0.3 au . in that region , planets of 1 - 3 neptune masses can be excluded by our limits determinations ( fig . 6 ) . in most of the limits determinations , there are multiple `` blind spots '' evident where the periodogram method failed to significantly recover the injected signals . typically this occurs at certain trial periods for which the phase coverage of the observational data is poor , and often at the 1-month and 1-year windows . for none of hd 37605 ( fig . 4 ) , hd 80606 ( fig . 5 ) , or hd 89744 ( fig . 6 ) could additional companions be ruled out below about 0.7 , and for most orbital periods tested , the limits were substantially worse . one possible explanation for this result is that the sampling of the observations was poorly distributed in phase for many of the injected test signals , making significant recovery by the periodogram method difficult . this is evidenced by the `` jagged '' regions in the plots . also , the intrinsic scatter for those three systems was too large to permit tight limits determination . this is certainly reasonable for the f7 star hd 89744 . the three systems with the best limits ( hd 3651 , hd 45350 , and 16 cyg b ) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions ( mean= ; table 1 ) . in contrast , the mean rms for the remaining three systems was . additional factors such as a paucity of data ( hd 37605 ) and short time baselines ( hd 80606 , hd 89744 ) made the determination of useful companion limits challenging for some of the planetary systems in this study . we have shown that for a sample of six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems , there is no evidence for additional planets . test particle simulations show that there are regions detectable by current surveys ( i.e. for au ) where additional objects can exist . for hd 3651 and hd 37605 , we find that protected resonances are also present . combining these simulations with detection limits computed using new high - precision het data combined with all available published data is particularly effective for the hd 3651 and hd 45350 systems . additional short - period planets can be ruled out down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions in these systems . this material is

{"article": "biological aggregations such as fish schools , bird flocks , bacterial colonies , and insect swarms have characteristic morphologies governed by the group members interactions with each other and with their environment . the endogenous interactions , i.e. , those between individuals , often involve organisms reacting to each other in an attractive or repulsive manner when they sense each other either directly by sound , sight , smell or touch , or indirectly via chemicals , vibrations , or other signals . a typical modeling strategy is to treat each individual as a moving particle whose velocity is influenced by social ( interparticle ) attractive and repulsive forces . in contrast , the exogenous forces describe an individual s reaction to the environment , for instance a response to gravity , wind , a chemical source , a light source , a food source , or a predator . the superposition of endogenous and exogenous forces can lead to characteristic swarm shapes ; these equilibrium solutions are the subject of our present study . more specifically , our motivation is rooted in our previous modeling study of the swarming desert locust schistocerca gregaria . in some parameter regimes of our model ( presented momentarily ) , locusts self - organize into swarms with a peculiar morphology , namely a bubble - like shape containing a dense group of locusts on the ground and a flying group of locusts overhead ; see figure (bc ) . the two are separated by an unoccupied gap . with wind , the swarm migrates with a rolling motion . locusts at the front of the swarm fly downwards and land on the ground . locusts on the ground , when overtaken by the flying swarm , take off and rejoin the flying group ; see figure (cd ) . the presence of an unoccupied gap and the rolling motion are found in real locust swarms . as we will show throughout this paper , features of swarms such as dense concentrations and disconnected components ( that is , the presence of gaps ) arise as properties of equilibria in a general model of swarming . the model of is which describes interacting locusts with positions . the direction of locust swarm migration is strongly correlated with the direction of the wind and has little macroscopic motion in the transverse direction , so the model is two - dimensional , i.e. , where the coordinate is aligned with the main current of the wind and is a vertical coordinate . as the velocity of each insect is simply a function of position , the model neglects inertial forces . this so - called kinematic assumption is common in swarming models , and we discuss it further in section . the first term on the right - hand side of  describes endogenous forces ; measures the force that locust exerts on locust . the first term of describes attraction , which operates with strength over a length scale and is necessary for aggregation . the second term is repulsive , and operates more strongly and over a shorter length scale in order to prevent collisions . time and space are scaled so that the repulsive strength and length scale are unity . the second term on the right - hand side of  describes gravity , acting downwards with strength . the last term describes advection of locusts in the direction of the wind with speed . furthermore , the model assumes a flat impenetrable ground . since locusts rest and feed while grounded , their motion in that state is negligible compared to their motion in the air . thus we add to  the stipulation that grounded locusts whose vertical velocity is computed to be negative under  remain stationary . as mentioned above , for some parameters ,  forms a bubble - like shape . this can occur even in the absence of wind , that is , when ; see figure (b ) . the bubble is crucial , for it allows the swarm to roll in the presence of wind . as discussed in , states which lack a bubble in the absence of wind do not migrate in the presence of wind . conditions for bubble formation , even in the equilibrium state arising in the windless model , have not been determined ; we will investigate this problem . some swarming models adopt a discrete approach as in our locust example above because of the ready connection to biological observations . a further advantage is that simulation of discrete systems is straightforward , requiring only the integration of ordinary differential equations . however , since biological swarms contain many individuals , the resulting high - dimensional systems of differential equations can be difficult or impossible to analyze . furthermore , for especially large systems , computation , though straightforward , may become a bottleneck . continuum models are more amenable to analysis . one well - studied continuum model is that of , a partial integrodifferential equation model for a swarm population density in one spatial dimension : the density obeys a conservation equation , and is the velocity field , which is determined via convolution with the antisymmetric pairwise endogenous force , the one - dimensional analog of a social force like the one in  . the general model  displays at least three solution types as identified in . populations may concentrate to a point , reach a finite steady state , or spread . in , we identified conditions on the social interaction force for each behavior to occur . these conditions map out a `` phase diagram '' dividing parameter space into regions associated with each behavior . similar phase diagrams arise in a dynamic particle model and its continuum analog . models that break the antisymmetry of ( creating an asymmetric response of organisms to each other ) display more complicated phenomena , including traveling swarms . many studies have sought conditions under which the population concentrates to a point mass . in a one - dimensional domain , collapse occurs when the force is finite and attractive at short distances . the analogous condition in higher dimensions also leads to collapse . one may also consider the case when the velocity includes an additional term describing an exogenous force , in this case , equilibrium solutions consisting of sums of point - masses can be linearly and nonlinearly stable , even for social forces that are repulsive at short distances . these results naturally lead to the question of whether a solution can be continued past the time at which a mass concentrates . early work on a particular generalization of  suggests the answer is yes . for  itself in arbitrary dimension , there is an existence theory beyond the time of concentration . some of the concentration solutions mentioned above are equilibrium solutions . however , there may be classical equilibria as well . for most purely attractive , the only classical steady states are constant in space , as shown via a variational formulation of the steady state problem . however , these solutions are non - biological , as they contain infinite mass . there do exist attractive - repulsive which give rise to compactly - supported classical steady states of finite mass . for instance , in simulations of  , we found classical steady state solutions consisting of compactly supported swarms with jump discontinuities at the edges of the support . in our current work , we will find equilibria that contain both classical and nonclassical components . many of the results reviewed above were obtained by exploiting the underlying gradient flow structure of  . there exists an energy functional = {2 } \\int \\int \\rho(x ) \\rho(y ) q(x - y)\\,dx\\,dy + \\int f(x)\\rho(x)\\,dx,\\ ] ] which is minimized under the dynamics . this energy can be interpreted as the continuum analog of the summed pairwise energy of the corresponding discrete ( particle ) model . we will also exploit this energy to find equilibrium solutions and study their stability . in this paper , we focus on equilibria of swarms and ask the following questions : * what sorts of density distributions do swarming systems make ? are they classical or nonclassical ? * how are the final density distributions reached affected by endogenous interactions , exogenous forces , boundaries , and the interplay of these ? * how well can discrete and continuum swarming systems approximate each other ? to answer these questions , we formulate a general mathematical framework for discrete , interacting swarm members in one spatial dimension , also subject to exogenous forces . we then derive an analogous continuum model and use variational methods to seek minimizers of its energy . this process involves solution of a fredholm integral equation for the density . for some choices of endogenous forces , we are able to find exact solutions . perhaps surprisingly , they are not always classical . in particular , they can involve -function concentrations of mass at the domain boundary . the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section , we create the mathematical framework for our study , and derive conditions for a particular density distribution to be an equilibrium solution , and to be stable to various classes of perturbations . in sections and , we demonstrate different types of swarm equilibria via examples . in section , we focus on purely repulsive endogenous interactions . we consider a bounded domain with no exogenous forces , a half - line subject to gravitational forces , and an unbounded domain subject to a quadratic exogenous potential , modeling attraction to a light , chemical , or nutrient source . for all three situations , we find exact solutions for swarm equilibria . for the first two examples , these equilibria consist of a density distribution that is classical in the interior of the domain , but contains -functions at the boundaries . for the third example , the equilibrium is compactly supported with the density dropping discontinuously to zero at the edge of the support . for all three examples , we compare analytical solutions from the continuum framework to equilibria obtained from numerical simulation of the underlying discrete system . the two agree closely even for small numbers of discrete swarm members . section is similar to section , but we now consider the more complicated case of endogenous interactions that are repulsive on short length scales and attractive over longer ones ; such forces are typical for swarming biological organisms . in section , we revisit locust swarms , focusing on their bubble - like morphology as described above , and on the significance of dimensionality . in a one - dimensional model corresponding to a vertical slice of a wide locust swarm under the influence of social interactions and gravity , energy minimizers can reproduce concentrations of locusts on the ground and a group of locusts above the ground , but there can not be a separation between the two groups . however , a quasi - two - dimensional model accounting for the influence of the swarm s horizontal extent does , in contrast , have minimizers which qualitatively correspond to the biological bubble - like swarms . consider identical interacting particles ( swarm members ) in one spatial dimension with positions . assume that motion is governed by newton s law , so that acceleration is proportional to the sum of the drag and motive forces . we will focus on the case where the acceleration is negligible and the drag force is proportional to the velocity . this assumption is appropriate when drag forces dominate momentum , commonly known in fluid dynamics as the low reynolds number or stokes flow regime . in the swarming literature , the resulting models , which are first - order in time , are known as kinematic models have been used in numerous studies of swarming and collective behavior , including ) . we now introduce a general model with both endogenous and exogenous forces , as with the locust model  . the endogenous forces act between individuals and might include social attraction and repulsion ; see for a discussion . for simplicity , we assume that the endogenous forces act in an additive , pairwise manner . we also assume that the forces are symmetric , that is , the force induced by particle on particle is the opposite of that induced by particle on particle . exogenous forces might include gravity , wind , and taxis towards light or nutrients . the governing equations take the form eventually we will examine the governing equations for a continuum limit of the discrete problem . to this end , we have introduced a social mass which scales the strength of the endogenous forces so as to remain bounded for . is the total social mass of the ensemble .  defines the velocity rule ; is the endogenous velocity one particle induces on another , and is the exogenous velocity . from our assumption of symmetry of endogenous forces , is odd and in most realistic situations is discontinuous at the origin . each force , and , can be written as the gradient of a potential under the relatively minor assumption of integrability . as pointed out in , most of the specific models for mutual interaction forces proposed in the literature satisfy this requirement . many exogenous forces including gravity and common forms of chemotaxis do so as well . under this assumption , we rewrite  as a gradient flow , where the potential is the double sum describes the endogenous forces and the single sum describes the exogenous forces . also , is the mutual interaction potential , which is even , and is the exogenous potential . the flow described by  will evolve towards minimizers of the energy . up to now , we have defined the problem on . in order to confine the problem to a particular domain , one may use the artifice of letting the exogenous potential tend to infinity on the complement of . while this discrete model is convenient from a modeling and simulation standpoint , it is difficult to analyze . presently , we will derive a continuum analog of  . this continuum model will allow us to derive equilibrium solutions and determine their stability via the calculus of variations and integral equation methods . to derive a continuum model , we begin by describing our evolving ensemble of discrete particles with a density function equal to a sum of -functions . ( for brevity , we suppress the dependence of in the following discussion . ) our approach here is similar to . these -functions have strength and are located at the positions of the particles : the total mass is where is the domain of the problem . using  , we write the discrete velocity in terms of a continuum velocity . that is , we require where by conservation of mass , the density obeys with no mass flux at the boundary . we now introduce an energy functional ] for nontrivial perturbations , which follows from  being exact . to summarize , we have obtained the following results : * equilibrium solutions satisfy the fredholm integral equation  and the mass constraint  . * the solution is a local and global minimizer with respect to the first class of perturbations ( those with support in ) if in  is positive . * the solution is a local minimizer with respect to the second ( more general zero - mass ) class of perturbations if satisfies  . if in addition is positive for these perturbations , then is a global minimizer as well . in practice , we solve the integral equation  to find candidate solutions . then , we compute to determine whether is a local minimizer . finally , when possible , we show the positivity of to guarantee that is a global minimizer . as the continuum limit replaces individual particles with a density , we need to make sure the continuum problem inherits a physical interpretation for the underlying problem . if we think about perturbing an equilibrium configuration , we note that mass can not `` tunnel '' between disjoint components of the solution . as such we define the concept of a multi - component swarm equilibrium . suppose the swarm s support can be divided into a set of disjoint , closed , connected components , that is we define a swarm equilibrium as a configuration in which each individual swarm component is in equilibrium , we can still define in + f(x ) = \\int {{\\omega {{{\\bar \\rho}}}}}q(x - y ) { { \\bar \\rho}}(y)~dy + f(x),\\ ] ] but now in . we can now define a swarm minimizer . we say a swarm equilibrium is a swarm minimizer if for some neighborhood of each component of the swarm . in practice this means that the swarm is an energy minimizer for infinitesimal redistributions of mass in the neighborhood of each component . this might also be called a lagrangian minimizer in the sense that the equilibrium is a minimizer with respect to infinitesimal lagrangian deformations of the distributions . it is crucial to note that even if a solution is a global minimizer , other multi - component swarm minimizers may still exist . these solutions are local minimizers and consequently a global minimizer may not be a global attractor under the dynamics of  . in this section we discuss the minimization problem formulated in section . it is helpful for expository purposes to make a concrete choice for the interaction potential . as previously mentioned , in many physical , chemical , and biological applications , the pairwise potential is symmetric . additionally , repulsion dominates at short distances ( to prevent collisions ) and the interaction strength approaches zero for very long distances . a common choice for is the morse potential with parameters chosen to describe long - range attraction and short - range repulsion . for the remainder of this section , we consider a simpler example where is the laplace distribution which represents repulsion with strength decaying exponentially in space . when there is no exogenous potential , , and when the domain is infinite , e.g. , , the swarm will spread without bound . the solutions asymptotically approach the barenblatt solution to the porous medium equation as shown in . however , when the domain is bounded or when there is a well in the exogenous potential , bounded swarms are observed both analytically and numerically , as we will show . figure shows solutions for three cases : a bounded domain with no exogenous potential , a gravitational potential on a semi - infinite domain , and a quadratic potential well on an infinite domain . in each case , a bounded swarm solution is observed but the solutions are not necessarily continuous and can even contain -function concentrations at the boundaries . we discuss these three example cases in detail later in this section . first , we will formulate the minimization problem for the case of the laplace potential . we will attempt to solve the problem classically ; when the solution has compact support contained within the domain we find solutions that are continuous within the support and may have jump discontinuities at the boundary of the support . however , when the boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the domain , the classical solution may break down and it is necessary to include a distributional component in the solution . we also formulate explicit conditions for the solutions to be global minimizers . we then apply these results to the three examples mentioned above . recall that for to be a steady solution , it must satisfy the integral equation  subject to the mass constraint  . for to be a local minimizer , it must also satisfy  , finally , recall that for a solution to be a global minimizer , the second variation  must be positive . we saw that if , this is guaranteed . for  , and so for the remainder of this section , we are able to ignore the issue of . any local minimizer that we find will be a global minimizer . additionally , for the remainder of this section , we restrict our attention to cases where the support of the solution is a single interval in ; in other words , the minimizing solution has a connected support . the reason that we are able to make this restriction follows from the notion of swarm minimization , discussed above . in fact , we can show that there are no multi - component swarm minimizers for the laplace potential as long as the exogenous potential is convex , that is , on . to see this , assume we have a swarm minimizer with a at least two disjoint components . consider in the gap between two components so that . we differentiate twice to obtain note that as in . by assumption . consequently , in and so is convex upwards in the gap . also , at the endpoints of the gap . we conclude from the convexity that must be less than near one of the endpoints . this violates the condition of swarm minimization from the previous section , and hence the solution is not a swarm minimizer . since swarm minimization is a necessary condition for global minimization , we now , as discussed , restrict attention to single - component solutions . for concreteness , assume the support of the solution is ] and any mass we can find a solution to  with smooth in the interior and with a concentration at the endpoints . however , we havent yet addressed the issue of being non - negative , nor have we considered whether it is a minimizer . we next consider whether the extremal solution is a minimizer , which involves the study of  . we present a differential operator method that allows us to compute and deduce sufficient conditions for to be a minimizer . we start by factoring the differential operator where . applying these operators to the interaction potential , we see that substituting in  into our definition of in  yields now consider applying to  at a point in . we see that = { ^- } ,\\ ] ] where we ve used the fact that in . if we let and let decrease to zero , the integral term vanishes and solving for yields the first half of  . a similar argument near yields the value of . assuming does not coincide with an endpoint of , we now consider the region , which is to the left of the support . again , applying to  simplifies the equation ; we can check that both the integral term and the contribution from the -functions are annihilated by this operator , from which we deduce that = 0 \\qquad \\rightarrow \\qquad f(x)- \\lambda(x ) = ce^x,\\ ] ] where is an unknown constant . a quick check shows that if is continuous , then is continuous at the endpoints of so that . this in turn determines , yielding e^{x-\\alpha } \\qquad { \\rm for } \\quad x \\leq \\alpha.\\ ] ] a similar argument near yields e^{\\beta -x } \\qquad { \\rm for } \\quad x \\geq \\beta.\\ ] ] as discussed in section , for to be a minimizer we wish for for and . a little algebra shows that this is equivalent to if and are both strictly inside , then  constitutes sufficient conditions for the extremal solution to be a global minimizer ( recalling that ) . we may also derive a necessary condition at the endpoints of the support from  . as increases to , we may apply lhpital s rule and this equation becomes equivalent to the condition , as expected . a similar calculation letting decrease to implies that . however , since is a density , we are looking for positive solutions . hence , either or coincides with the left endpoint of . similarly , either or coincides with the right edge of . this is consistent with the result  which showed that -functions can not occur in the interior of . in summary , we come to two conclusions : * a globally minimizing solution contains a -function only if a boundary of the support of the solution coincides with a boundary of the domain . * a globally minimizing solution must satisfy  . we now consider three concrete examples for and . we model a one - dimensional biological swarm with repulsive social interactions described by the laplace potential . we begin with the simplest possible case , namely no exogenous potential , and a finite domain which for convenience we take to be the symmetric interval ] with . cross - hatched boxes indicate the boundary of the domain . the solid line is the classical solution . dots correspond to the numerically - obtained equilibrium of the discrete system  with swarm members . the density at each lagrangian grid point is estimated using the correspondence discussed in section  and pictured in figure . each `` lollipop '' at the domain boundary corresponds to a -function of mass in the analytical solution , and simultaneously to a superposition of swarm members in the numerical simulation . hence , we see excellent agreement between the continuum minimizer and the numerical equilibrium even for this relatively small number of lagrangian points . we now consider repulsive social interactions and an exogenous gravitational potential . the spatial coordinate describes the elevation above ground . consequently , is the semi - infinite interval . then with , shown in figure (f ) . as we know from  that the minimizing solution has a connected support , i.e. , it is a single component . moreover , translating this component downward decreases the exogenous energy while leaving the endogenous energy unchanged . thus , the support of the solution must be ] which is positive , and hence the solution is globally stable . for our previous calculation naively implies . since can not be negative , the minimizer in this case is a -function at the origin , namely , shown in figure (d ) . in this case , from  and from  . it follows that the first inequality follows from a taylor expansion . the second follows from our assumption . since the solution is a global minimizer . in summary , there are two cases . when , the globally stable minimizer is a -function at the origin . when there is a globally stable minimizer consisting of a -function at the origin which is the left -

negative and then consider the solutions stability to determine if it is a local or global minimizer . in the case where is contained in the interior of , we know that as discussed in section . we consider this case below . suppose is contained in the interior of . then . following section , we try to determine when in and when , which constitute necessary and sufficient conditions for to be a global minimizer . we apply to  at a point . the integral term and the terms arising from the functions vanish . the equation is simply . we write the solution as the two constants are determined as follows . from  , is a continuous function , and thus we derive a jump condition on the derivative to get another equation for . we differentiate  and determine that is continuous . however , since for , . substituting this result into the derivative of  and letting increase to , we find the solution to  and  is now that is known near we can compute when , at least near the left side of . taylor expanding around , we find the quadratic term in  has coefficient where the second line comes from substituting  with and noting that the classical part of the solution must be nonnegative since it is a density . furthermore , since we expect ( this can be shown a posteriori ) , we have that the quadratic term in  is positive . a similar analysis holds near the boundary . therefore , for in a neighborhood outside of . stated differently , the solution  is a swarm minimizer , that is , it is stable with respect to infinitesimal redistributions of mass . the domain is determined through the relations  and  , which , when , become in the following subsections , we will consider the solution of the continuum system  and  with no external potential , . we consider two cases for the morse interaction potential  : first , the catastrophic case on , for which the above calculation applies , and second , for the h -

two - dimensional model in which the horizontal structure is assumed uniform . in particular , we will make a comparison between a one - dimensional and a quasi - two - dimensional model . both models take the form of the energy minimization problem  on a semi - infinite domain , with an exogenous potential describing gravity . the models differ in the choice of the endogenous potential , which is chosen to describe either one - dimensional or quasi - two - dimensional repulsion . the one - dimensional model is precisely that which we considered in section . there we saw that minimizers of the one - dimensional model can reproduce the concentrations of locusts on the ground and a group of individuals above the ground , but there can not be a separation between the grounded and airborne groups . we will show below that for the quasi - two - dimensional model , this is not the case , and indeed , some minimizers have a gap between the two groups . as mentioned , the one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional models incorporate only endogenous repulsion . however , the behavior we describe herein does not change for the more biologically realistic situation when attraction is present . we consider the repulsion - only case in order to seek the minimal mechanism responsible for the appearance of the gap . we consider a swarm in two dimensions , with spatial coordinate . we will eventually confine the vertical coordinate to be nonnegative , since it describes the elevation above the ground at . we assume the swarm to be uniform in the horizontal direction , so that . we construct a quasi - two - dimensional interaction potential , letting and , this yields it is straightforward to show that the two - dimensional energy per unit horizontal length is given by = {2 } \\int {{\\omega}}\\int {{\\omega}}\\rho(x 1 ) \\rho(y 1 ) q {2d}(x 1-y 1)\\,dx 1\\,dy 1 + \\int {{\\omega}}f(x 1)\\rho(x 1)\\,dx 1,\\ ] ] where the exogenous force is and the domain is the half - line . this is exactly analogous to the one - dimensional problem  , but with particles interacting according to the quasi - two - dimensional endogenous potential . similarly , the corresponding dynamical equations are simply  and  but with endogenous force . for the laplace potential  , the quasi - two - dimensional potential is this integral can be manipulated for ease of calculation , where  comes from symmetry ,  comes from letting ,  comes from letting , and  comes from the trigonometric substitution . from an asymptotic expansion of  , we find that for small , whereas for large , .\\ ] ] in our numerical study , it is important to have an efficient method of computing values of . in practice , we use  for small ,  for large , and for intermediate values of we interpolate from a lookup table pre - computed using  . the potential is shown in figure . note that is horizontal at , and monotonically decreasing in . the negative of the slope reaches a maximum of the quantity plays a key role in our analysis of minimizers below . the fourier transform of can be evaluated exactly using the integral definition  and interchanging the order of integration of and to obtain which we note is positive , so local minimizers are global minimizers per the discussion in section . we model a quasi - two - dimensional biological swarm with repulsive social interactions of laplace type and subject to an exogenous gravitational potential , . the spatial coordinate describes the elevation above ground . consequently , is the semi - infinite interval . from section , recall that for the one - dimensional model , is a minimizer for some , corresponding to all swarm members pinned by gravity to the ground . we consider this same solution as a candidate minimizer for the quasi - two - dimensional problem . in this case , above is actually a minimizer for any mass . to see this , we can compute , since , increases away from the origin and hence is at least a swarm minimizer . in fact , if , is a global minimizer because which guarantees that is strictly increasing for as shown in figure (a ) . because it is strictly increasing , for . given this fact , and additionally , since as previously shown , is a global minimizer . this means that if an infinitesimal amount of mass is added anywhere in the system , it will descend to the origin . consequently , we believe this solution is the global attractor ( though we have not proven this ) . note that while the condition is sufficient for to be a global minimizer , it is not necessary . as alluded above , it is not necessary that be strictly increasing , only that for . this is the case for for , where . figure (b ) shows a case when . although for , has a local minimum . in this situation , although the solution with the mass concentrated at the origin is a global minimizer , it is not a global attractor . we will see that a small amount of mass added near the local minimum of will create a swarm minimizer , which is dynamically stable to perturbations . figure (c ) shows the critical case when . in this case the local minimum of at satisfies and . figure (d ) shows the case when and now in the neighborhood of the minimum . in this case the solution with the mass concentrated at the origin is only a swarm minimizer ; the energy of the system can be reduced by transporting some of the mass at the origin to the neighborhood of the local minimum . when it is possible to construct a continuum of swarm minimizers . we have conducted a range of simulations for varying and have measured two basic properties of the solutions . we set and use in all simulations of the discrete system . initially , all the swarm members are high above the ground and we evolve the simulation to equilibrium . figure (a ) measures the mass on the ground as a percentage of the total swarm mass . the horizontal blue line indicates ( schematically ) that for , the equilibrium consists of all mass concentrated at the origin ; as discussed above , this state is the global minimizer and ( we believe ) the global attractor . as mass is increased through , the equilibrium is a swarm minimizer consisting of a classical swarm in the air separated from the origin , and some mass concentrated on the ground . as increases , the proportion of mass located on the ground decreases monotonically . figure (b ) visualizes the support of the airborne swarm , which exists only for ; the lower and upper data represent the coordinates of the bottom and top of the swarm , respectively . as mass is increased , the span of the swarm increases monotonically . as established above , when , swarm minimizers exist with two components . in fact , there is a continuum of swarm minimizers with different proportions of mass in the air and on the ground . which minimizer is obtained in simulation depends on initial conditions . figure shows two such minimizers for and , and the associated values of ( each obtained from a different initial condition ) . recalling that for a swarm minimizer , each connected component of the swarm , is constant , we define for the grounded component and for the airborne component . in figure (ab ) , of the mass is contained in the grounded component . in this case , indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the air to the ground . in contrast , in figure (cd ) , of the mass is contained in the grounded component . in this case , indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the ground to the air . note that by continuity , we believe a state exists where , which would correspond to a global minimizer . however , this state is clearly not a global attractor and hence will not necessarily be achieved in simulation . we ve demonstrated that for one can construct a continuum of swarm minimizers with a gap between grounded and airborne components , and that for these solutions can have a lower energy than the state with the density concentrated solely on the ground . by contrast with the one - dimensional system of section in which no gap is observed , these gap states appear to be the generic configuration for sufficiently large mass in the quasi - two - dimensional system . we conclude that dimensionality is crucial element for the formation of the bubble - like shape of real locust swarms . in this paper we deeveloped a framework for studying equilibrium solutions for swarming problems . we related the discrete swarming problem to an associated continuum model . this continuum model has an energy formulation which enables analysis equilibrium solutions and their stability . we derived conditions for an equilibrium solution to be a local minimizer , a global minimizer , and/or a swarm minimizer , that is , stable to infinitesimal lagrangian deformations of the mass . we found many examples of compactly supported equilibrium solutions , which may be discontinuous at the boundary of the support . in addition , when a boundary of the support coincides with the domain boundary , a minimizer may contain a -concentration there . for the case of exogenous repulsion modeled by the laplace potential , we computed three example equilibria . on a bounded domain , the minimizer is a constant density profile with -functions at each end . on a half - line with an exogenous gravitational potential , the minimizer is a compactly supported linear density profile with a -function at the origin . in free space with an exogenous quadratic potential , the minimizer is a compactly supported inverted parabola with jump discontinuities at the endpoints . each of the aforementioned solutions is also a global minimizer . to extend the results above , we also found analytical solutions for exogenous attractive - repulsive forces , modeled with the morse potential . in the case that the social force was in the catastrophic statistical mechanical regime , we found a compactly supported solution whose support is independent of the total population mass . this means that within the modeling assumptions , swarms become denser with increasing mass . for the case of an h - stable social force , there is no equilibrium solution on an infinite domain . on a finite domain , mass is partitioned between a classical solution in the interior and -concentrations on the boundary . we recall that for the locust model of ( see figure ) a concentration of locusts occurs on the ground , with a seemingly classical component above , separated by a gap . none of the one - dimensional solutions ( for the laplace and morse potentials ) discussed above contain a gap , that is , multiple swarm components that are spatially disconnected , suggesting that this configuration is intrinsically two - dimensional . to study this configuration , we computed a quasi - two - dimensional potential corresponding to a horizontally uniform swarm . we demonstrated numerically that for a wide range of parameters , there exists a continuous family of swarm minimizers that consist of a concentration on the ground and a disconnected , classical component in the air , reminiscent of our earlier numerical studies of a discrete locust swarm model . we believe that the analytical solutions we found provide a sampling of the rich tapestry of equilibrium solutions that manifest in the general model we have considered , and in nature . we hope that these solutions will inspire further analysis and guide future modeling efforts . cmt acknowledges support from the nsf through grants dms-0740484 and dms-1009633 . ajb gratefully acknowledges the support from the nsf through grants dms-0807347 and dms-0730630 , and the hospitality of robert kohn and the courant institute of mathematical sciences . we both wish to thank the institute for mathematics and its applications where portions of this work were completed . , optimal transportation , dissipative pde s and functional inequalities , in optimal transportation and applications ( martina franca , 2001 ) , vol . 1813 of lecture notes in math . , springer , berlin , 2003 , pp .", "summary": "we study equilibrium configurations of swarming biological organisms subject to exogenous and pairwise endogenous forces . beginning with a discrete dynamical model , we derive a variational description of the corresponding continuum population density . equilibrium solutions are extrema of an energy functional , and satisfy a fredholm integral equation . we find conditions for the extrema to be local minimizers , global minimizers , and minimizers with respect to infinitesimal lagrangian displacements of mass . in one spatial dimension , for a variety of exogenous forces , endogenous forces , and domain configurations , we find exact analytical expressions for the equilibria . these agree closely with numerical simulations of the underlying discrete model.the exact solutions provide a sampling of the wide variety of equilibrium configurations possible within our general swarm modeling framework . the equilibria typically are compactly supported and may contain -concentrations or jump discontinuities at the edge of the support . we apply our methods to a model of locust swarms , which are observed in nature to consist of a concentrated population on the ground separated from an airborne group . our model can reproduce this configuration ; quasi -

{"article": "studies of charm decays are pursued for several different reasons . first of all , there is the possibility of directly observing new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since the effects of cp violation due to sm processes is highly suppressed allowing new physics contributions to be more easily seen than in decays where the sm processes typically have large effects . mixing also is interesting because it could come from either sm or new physics ( np ) processes , and could teach us interesting lessons . another important reason for detailed charm studies is that most s , % , decay into charm , so knowledge about charm decays is particularly useful for decay studies . especially interesting are absolute branching ratios , resonant substructures in multi - body decays , phases on dalitz plots , etc .. other heavier objects such as top quarks decay into quarks and higgs particles may decay with large rates to , again making charm studies important . furthermore , charm can teach us a great deal about strong interactions , especially decay constants and final state interactions . charm has been studied at colliders at threshold , first by the mark iii collaboration and more recently by bes and cleo - c , at higher energies , and at fixed target and hadron collider experiments . the detection techniques are rather different at threshold than in other experiments . the resonance decays into ; the world average cross - section is 3.72.09 nb for production and 2.82.09 nb for production . production is studied at 4170 mev , where the cross - section for + is nb . the underlying light quark continuum \" background is about 14 nb . the relatively large cross - sections , relatively large branching ratios and sufficient luminosities , allow experiments to fully reconstruct one as a tag . \" since the charge and flavor of the tag is then uniquely determined , the rest of the event can be examined for characteristics of the other known \" particle . to measure absolute branching ratios , for example at the , the rest of the event is fully reconstructed , as well as the tag . at the meson final states are reconstructed by first evaluating the difference in the energy , , of the decay products with the beam energy . candidates with consistent with zero are selected and then the beam - constrained mass is evaluated , where runs over all the final state particles . examples of single and double reconstruction are presented in fig .

{"article": "quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation provide a plausible mechanism to generate the energy - density perturbations responsible for observed cosmological structure . while it has been known for quite some time that inflation is consistent with open spatial hypersurfaces ( gott 1982 ; guth & weinberg 1983 ) , attention was initially focussed on models in which there are a very large number of -foldings during inflation , resulting in almost exactly flat spatial hypersurfaces for the observable part of the present universe ( guth 1981 ; also see kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , b ) . this was , perhaps , inevitable because of strong theoretical prejudice towards flat spatial hypersurfaces and their resulting simplicity . however , to get a very large number of -foldings during inflation it seems necessary that the inflation model have a small dimensionless parameter ( j. r. gott , private communication 1994 ; banks et al . 1995 ) , which would require an explanation . attempts to reconcile these favoured \" flat spatial hypersurfaces with observational measures of a low value for the clustered - mass density parameter have concentrated on models in which one postulates the presence of a cosmological constant ( peebles 1984 ) . in the simplest flat- model one assumes a scale - invariant ( harrison 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) primordial power spectrum for gaussian adiabatic energy - density perturbations . such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation in a spatially - flat model , provided that the inflaton potential is reasonably flat ( fischler , ratra , & susskind 1985 , and references therein ) . it has been demonstrated that these models are indeed consistent with current observational constraints ( e.g. , stompor , grski , & banday 1995 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; ratra & sugiyama 1995 ; liddle et al . 1996b ; ganga , ratra , & sugiyama 1996b , hereafter grs ) . an alternative , more popular of late , is to accept that the spatial hypersurfaces are not flat . in this case , the radius of curvature for the open spatial sections introduces a new length scale ( in addition to the hubble length ) , which requires a generalization of the usual flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( ratra & peebles 1994 , hereafter rp94 ) . such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an epoch of inflation in an open - bubble model ( rp94 ; ratra & peebles 1995 , hereafter rp95 ; bucher et al . 1995 , hereafter bgt ; lyth & woszczyna 1995 ; yamamoto et al . 1995 , hereafter yst ) , provided that the inflaton potential inside the bubble is reasonably flat . such gaussian adiabatic open - bubble inflation models have also been shown to be consistent with current observational constraints ( rp94 ; kamionkowski et al . 1994 ; grski et al . 1995 , hereafter grsb ; liddle et al . 1996a , hereafter llrv ; ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ) . inflation theory by itself is unable to predict the normalization amplitude for the energy - density perturbations . currently , the least controversial and most robust method for the normalization of a cosmological model is to fix the amplitude of the model - predicted large - scale cmb spatial anisotropy by comparing it to the observed cmb anisotropy discovered by the -dmr experiment ( smoot et al . 1992 ) . previously , specific open cold dark matter ( cdm ) models have been examined in light of the -dmr two - year results ( bennett et al . grsb investigated the cmb anisotropy angular spectra predicted by the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) , and compared large - scale structure predictions of this dmr - normalized model to observational data . cayn et al . ( 1996 ) performed a related analysis for the open model with a flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( wilson 1983 , hereafter w83 ) , and yamamoto & bunn ( 1996 , hereafter yb ) examined the effect of additional sources of quantum fluctuations ( bgt ; yst ) in the open - bubble inflation model . in this paper , we study the observational predictions for a number of open cdm models . in particular , we employ the power spectrum estimation technique devised by grski ( 1994 ) for incomplete sky coverage to normalize the open models using the -dmr four - year data ( bennett 1996 ) . in we provide an overview of open - bubble inflation cosmogonies . in we detail the various dmr data sets used in the analyses here , discuss the various open models we consider , and present the dmr estimate of the cmb rms quadrupole anisotropy amplitude as a function of for these open models . in we detail the computation of several cosmographic and large - scale structure statistics for the dmr - normalized open models . these statistics are confronted by various current observational constraints in . our results are summarized in . the simplest open inflation model is that in which a single open - inflation bubble nucleates in a ( possibly ) spatially - flat , inflating spacetime ( gott 1982 ; guth & weinberg 1983 ) . in this model , the first epoch of inflation smooths away any preexisting spatial inhomogeneities , while simultaneously generating quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations . then , in a tunnelling event , an open - inflation bubble nucleates , and for a small enough nucleation probability the observable universe lies inside a single open - inflation bubble . fluctuations of relevance to the late - time universe can be generated via three different quantum mechanical mechanisms : ( 1 ) they can be generated in the first epoch of inflation ; ( 2 ) they can be generated during the tunnelling event ( thus resulting in a slightly inhomogeneous initial hypersurface inside the bubble , or a slightly non - spherical bubble ) ; and ( 3 ) they can be generated inside the bubble . the tunneling amplitude is largest for the most symmetrical solution ( and deviations from symmetry lead to an exponential suppression ) , so it has usually been assumed that the nucleation process ( mechanism ) does not lead to the generation of significant inhomogeneities . quantum - mechanical fluctuations generated during evolution inside the bubble ( rp95 ) are significant . assuming that the energy - density difference between the two epochs of inflation is negligible ( and so the bubble wall is not significant ) , one may estimate the contribution to the perturbation spectrum after bubble nucleation from quantum - mechanical fluctuations during the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) . as discussed by bucher & turok ( 1995 , hereafter bt ) ( also see yst ; yb ) , the observable predictions of these simple open - bubble inflation models are almost completely insensitive to the details of the first epoch of inflation , for the observationally - viable range of . this is because the fluctuations generated during this epoch affect only the smallest wavenumber part of the energy - density perturbation power spectrum , which can not contribute significantly to observable quantities because of the spatial curvature length cutoff \" in an open universe ( e.g. , w83 ; kamionkowski & spergel 1994 ; rp95 ) . inclusion of such fluctuations in the calculations alter the predictions for the present value of the rms linear mass fluctuations averaged over an mpc sphere , ] by . an additional possible effect determined for the specific model of an open - inflation bubble nucleating in a spatially - flat de sitter spacetime is that fluctuations of the bubble wall behave like a non - square - integrable basis function ( hamazaki et al . 1996 ; garriga 1996 ; garca - bellido 1996 ; yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka 1996 ) . while there are models in which these bubble - wall fluctuations are completely insignificant ( garriga 1996 ; yamamoto et al . 1996 ) , there is as yet no computation that accounts for both the bubble - wall fluctuations as well as those generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( which are always present ) , so it is not yet known if bubble - wall fluctuations can give rise to an observationally significant effect . finally , again in this very specific model , the effects of a finite bubble size at nucleation seem to alter the zero bubble size predictions only by a very small amount ( yamamoto et al . 1996 ; cohn 1996 ) . while there is no guarantee that there is a spatially - flat de sitter spacetime prior to bubble nucleation , these computations do illustrate the important point that the spatial curvature length cutoff \" in an open universe ( e.g. , rp95 ) does seem to ensure that what happens prior to bubble nucleation does not significantly affect the observable predictions for observationally - viable single - field open - bubble inflation models . it is indeed reassuring that accounting only for the quantum mechanical fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) seems to be essentially all that is required to make observational predictions for the single - field open - bubble inflation models . that is , the observational predictions of the open - bubble inflation scenario seem to be as robust as those for the spatially - flat inflation scenario . in this paper , we utilize the dmr four - year 53 and 90 ghz sky maps in both galactic and ecliptic coordinates . we thus quantify explicitly the expected small shifts in the inferred normalization amplitudes due to the small differences between the galactic- and ecliptic - coordinate maps . the maps are coadded using inverse - noise - variance weights derived in each coordinate system . the least sensitive 31 ghz maps have been omitted from the analysis , since their contribution is minimal under such a weighting scheme . the dominant source of emission in the dmr maps is due to the galactic plane . we are unable to model this contribution to the sky temperature to sufficient accuracy to enable its subtraction , thus we excise all pixels where the galactic - plane signal dominates the cmb . the geometry of the cut has been determined by using the dirbe 140 m map as a tracer of the strongest emission , as described completely in banday ( 1996a ) . all pixels with galactic latitude 20 are removed , together with regions towards scorpius - ophiucus and taurus - orion . there are 3881 surviving pixels in galactic coordinates and 3890 in ecliptic . this extended ( four - year data ) galactic plane cut has provided the biggest impact on the analysis of the dmr data ( see grski et al . 1996 , hereafter g96 ) . the extent to which residual high - latitude galactic emission can modify our results has been quantified in two ways . since the spatial morphology of galactic synchrotron , free - free and dust emission seems to be well described by a steeply falling power spectrum ( kogut 1996a , g96 ) , the cosmological signal is predominantly compromised on the largest angular scales . as a simple test of galactic contamination , we perform all computations both including and excluding the observed sky quadrupole . a more detailed approach ( g96 ) notes that a large fraction of the galactic signal can be accounted for by using the dirbe 140 m sky map ( reach 1995 ) as a template for free - free and dust emission , and the 408 mhz all - sky radio survey ( haslam 1981 ) to describe synchrotron emission . a correlation analysis yields coupling coefficients for the two templates at each of the dmr frequencies . we have repeated our model analysis after correcting the coadded sky maps by the galactic templates scaled by the coefficients derived in g96 . in particular , we adopt those values derived under the assumption that the cmb anisotropy is well - described by an = 1 power law model with normalization amplitude 18 k and coupling coefficient amplitudes . in fact , we have investigated this for a sub - sample of the models considered here in which we varied but fixed and . no statistically significant changes were found in the derived values of either or the coupling coefficients . ] . one might make criticisms of either technique : excluding information from an analysis , in this case the quadrupole components , can obviously weaken any conclusions simply because statistical uncertainties will grow ; at the same time , it is not clear whether the galactic corrections applied are completely adequate . we believe that , given these uncertainties , our analysis is the most complete and conservative one that is possible . the power spectrum analysis technique developed by grski ( 1994 ) is implemented . orthogonal basis functions for the fourier decomposition of the sky maps are constructed which specifically include both pixelization effects and the galactic cut . ( these are linear combinations of the usual spherical harmonics with multipole . ) the functions are coordinate system dependent . a likelihood analysis is then performed as described in grski ( 1994 ) . we consider four open model energy - density perturbation power spectra : ( 1 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , accounting only for fluctuations that are generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) ; ( 2 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for the fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) ; ( 3 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for both the usual fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation and a contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) ; and , ( 4 ) an open model with a flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( w83 ) . in all cases we have ignored the possibility of tilt or primordial gravity waves , since it is unlikely that they can have a significant effect in viable open models . with the eigenvalue of the spatial scalar laplacian being , where is the radial coordinate spatial wavenumber , the gauge - invariant fractional energy - density perturbation power spectrum of type ( 1 ) above is where is the transfer function and is the normalization amplitude ) generalize the primordial part of the spectrum of eq . ( 1 ) by multiplying it with . as yet , only the specific generalized spectrum ( i.e. , eq . ) is known to be a prediction of an open - bubble inflation model and therefore consistent with the presence of spatial curvature . it is premature to draw conclusions about open cosmogony on the basis of the version of the spectrum considered by bw . ] . in the simplest example , perturbations generated in the first epoch of inflation introduce an additional multiplicative factor , , on the right hand side of eq . ( 1 ) . for a discussion of the effects of the non - square - integrable basis function see yst and yb . the energy - density power spectrum of type ( 4 ) above is and in this case one can also consider , e.g. , ( w83 ) , but because of the spatial curvature cutoff \" in an open model the predictions are essentially indistinguishable . at small the asymptotic expressions are ( type 1 ) , ( type 2 ) , and ( type 4 ) . conventionally , the cmb fractional temperature perturbation , , is expressed as a function of angular position , , on the sky via the spherical harmonic decomposition , the cmb spatial anisotropy in a gaussian model can then be characterized by the angular perturbation spectrum , defined in terms of the ensemble average , the s used here were computed using two independent boltzmann transfer codes developed by ns ( e.g. , sugiyama 1995 ) and rs ( e.g. , stompor 1994 ) . some illustrative comparisons are shown in fig . we emphasize that the excellent agreement between the s computed using the two codes is mostly a reflection of the currently achievable numerical accuracy . currently , the major likely additional , unaccounted for , source of uncertainty is that due to the uncertainty in the modelling of various physical effects . the computations here assume a standard recombination thermal history , and ignore the possibility of early reionization . the simplest open models ( with the least possible number of free parameters ) have yet to be ruled out by observational data ( grsb ; ratra et al . 1995 ; grs ; this paper ) , so there is insufficient motivation to expand the model - parameter space by including the effect of early reionization , tilt or gravity waves values determined from the dmr data here ( assuming no early reionization ) are unlikely to be very significantly affected by early reionization . however , since structure forms earlier in an open model , other effects of early reionization might be more significant in an open model . while it is possible to heuristically account for such effects , an accurate quantitative estimate must await a better understanding of structure formation . ] . for the of types ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) above , we have evaluated the cmb anisotropy angular spectra for a range of spanning the interval between 0.1 and 1.0 , for a variety of values of ( the hubble parameter ) and the baryonic - mass density parameter . the values of were selected to cover the lower part of the range of ages consistent with current requirements ( 10.5 gyr , 12 gyr , or 13.5 gyr , with as a function of computed accordingly ; see , for example , jimenez et al . 1996 ; chaboyer et al . the values of were chosen to be consistent with current standard nucleosynthesis requirements ( 0.0055 , 0.0125 , or 0.0205 ; e.g. , copi , schramm , & turner 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . to render the problem tractable , s were determined for the central values of and , and for the two combinations of these parameters which most perturb the s from those computed at the central values ( i.e. , for the smallest we used the smallest , and for the largest we used the largest ) . specific parameter values are given in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of tables 16 , and representative anisotropy spectra can be seen in figs . 2 and 3 . we therefore improve on our earlier analysis of the dmr two - year data ( grsb ) by considering a suitably broader range in the ( , ) parameter space . the cmb anisotropy spectra for of type ( 3 ) above were computed for a range of spanning the interval between 0.1 and 0.9 , for and . specific parameter values are given in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of table 7 , and these spectra are shown in fig . 4 . in fig . 5 we compare the various spectra considered here . the differences in the low- shapes of the s in the various models ( figs . 25 ) are a consequence of three effects : ( 1 ) the shape of the energy - density perturbation power spectrum at low wavenumber ; ( 2 ) the exponential suppression at the spatial curvature scale in an open model ; and ( 3 ) the interplay between the usual \" ( fiducial cdm ) sachs - wolfe term and the integrated \" sachs - wolfe ( hereafter sw ) term in the expression for the cmb spatial anisotropy . the relative importance of these effects is determined by the value of , and leads to the non - monotonic behaviour of the large - scale s as a function of seen in figs . more precisely , the contributions to the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum from the usual \" and integrated \" sw terms have a different -dependence as well as a relative amplitude that is both and dependent . on very large angular scales ( small s ) , the dominant contribution to the usual \" sw term comes from a higher redshift ( when the length scales are smaller ) than does the dominant contribution to the integrated \" sw term ( hu & sugiyama 1994 , 1995 ) . as a result , in an open model on very large angular scales , the usual \" sw term is cut off more sharply by the spatial curvature length scale than is the integrated \" sw term ( hu & sugiyama 1994 ) , i.e. , on very large angular scales in an open model the usual \" sw term has a larger ( positive ) effective index than the integrated \" sw term . on slightly smaller angular scales the integrated \" sw term is damped ( i.e. , it has a negative effective index ) while the usual \" sw term plateaus ( hu & sugiyama 1994 ) . as a consequence , going from the largest to slightly smaller angular scales , the usual \" term rises steeply and then flattens , while the integrated \" term rises less steeply and then drops ( i.e. , it has a peak ) . the change in shape , as a function of , of these two terms is both and dependent . these are the two dominant effects at ; at higher other effects come into play . more specifically , for the curvature length scale cutoff and the precise large - scale form of the considered here are relatively unimportant the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum is quite similar to that for , and the dominant contribution is the usual \" sw term . for a that does not diverge at low wavenumber , as with the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum in an open model , for the exponential cutoff \" at the spatial curvature length dominates , and the lowest- s are suppressed ( figs . 3 and 5 ) . for this , as is reduced , the usual \" term continues to be important on the largest angular scales down to . as is reduced below the integrated \" term starts to dominate on the largest angular scales , and as is further reduced the integrated \" term also starts to dominate on smaller angular scales . from fig . 3(a ) one will notice that the integrated \" sw term peak \" first makes an appearance at the central line in the plot at and that as is further reduced ( in descending order along the curves shown ) the integrated \" term peak \" moves to smaller angular scales . the case is where the integrated \" term peaks at , and the damping of this term on smaller angular scales  is compensated for by the steep rise of the usual \" sw term the two terms are of roughly equal magnitude at and these effects result in the almost exactly scale - invariant spectrum at ( this case is more scale - invariant than fiducial cdm ) . a discussion of some of these features of the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum in the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model is given in cayn et al . ( 1996 ) . open - bubble inflation models have a that diverges at low wavenumber ( rp95 ; note that no physical quantity diverges ) , and this increases the low- s ( figs . 2 and 5 ) relative to those of the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( figs . 3 and 5 ) . the s for low models increase more than the higher ones , since , for a fixed wavenumber - dependence of , the divergence is more prominent at lower ( rp94 ) . the non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) contributes even more power on large angular scales , and so , at low- , the s of fig . 4 are slightly larger than those of fig . 2 ( also see fig . 5 ) . again , spectra at lower values of are more significantly influenced . as is clear from figs . 2 and 5 , in an open - bubble inflation model , quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation scarcely affect the s , although at the very lowest values of the very lowest order coefficients are slightly modified . the effect is concentrated in this region of the parameter space since the fluctuations in the first inflation epoch only contribute to , and increase , the lowest wavenumber part of . in simple open - bubble inflation models , the precise value of this small effect is dependent on the model assumed for the first epoch of inflation ( bt ) . since the dmr data is most sensitive to multipole moments with 810 , one expects the effect at 23 to be almost completely negligible ( bt ; also see yst ; yb ) . figs . 35 show that both the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model , and the contribution from the non - square - integrable mode , do lead to significantly different s ( compared to those of fig . the results of the dmr likelihood analyses are summarized in figs . 621 and tables 17 and 13 . two representative sets of likelihood functions are shown in figs . 6 and 7 . figure 6 shows those derived from the ecliptic - frame sky maps , ignoring the correction for faint high - latitude foreground galactic emission , and excluding the quadrupole moment from the analysis . figure 7 shows the likelihood functions derived from the galactic - frame sky maps , accounting for the faint high - latitude foreground galactic emission correction , and including the quadrupole moment in the analysis . together , these two data sets span the maximum range of normalizations inferred from our analysis ( the former providing the highest , and the latter the lowest ) . tables 17 give the central values and 1- and 2- ranges for spectra of type ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) above , computed from the appropriate posterior probability density distribution function assuming a uniform prior . each line in tables 17 lists these values at a given for the 8 possible combinations of : ( 1 ) galactic- or ecliptic - coordinate map ; ( 2 ) faint high - latitude galactic foreground emission correction accounted for or ignored ; and , ( 3 ) quadrupole included  or excluded  value of varying cosmological parameters like . since they do not quote derived values for this model we are not able to compare to their results . ] . the corresponding ridge lines of maximum likelihood value as a function of are shown in figs . 810 for some of the cosmological - parameter values considered here . although we have computed these values for spectra of type ( 2 ) above ( i.e. , those accounting for perturbations generated in the first epoch of inflation ) we record only a subset of them in column ( 4 ) of table 13 . these should be compared to columns ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) of table 13 , which show the maximal 2- range for spectra of types ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) . while the differences in between spectra ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are not totally insignificant , more importantly the differences between the ] , accurate to a few percent . here the mean square linear mass fluctuation averaged over a sphere of coordinate radius is ^ 2\\right\\rangle & = & { 2 \\over \\pi^2 \\left^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ { \\ } & { \\ } & \\times \\int^\\infty 0 { dk \\over ( 1 + k^2)^2 } \\left^2 p(k ) , \\ ] ] which , on small scales , reduces to the usual flat - space expression \\int^\\infty 0 dk\\ , k^2 p(k ) \\left^2/(k\\bar\\chi)^6 ] values are accurate to better than ( except for large baryon - fraction , , models where the error could be as large as ) . use of the analytic fits of eqs . ( 8)(11 ) for ( instead of the numerically determined values ) slightly increases the error , while use of the bbks transfer function fit parameterized by an earlier version of eq . ( 13 ) below , ] values that could be off by as much as . nevertheless , as has been demonstrated by llrv , the approximate analytic fit to the transfer function greatly simplifies the computation and allows for rapid demarcation of the favoured part of cosmological - parameter space . numerical values for some cosmographic and large - scale structure statistics for the models considered here are recorded in tables 915 . we emphasize that when comparing to observational data we make use of numerically - determined large - scale structure predictions , not those derived using an approximate analytic fitting formula . tables 912 give the predictions for the open - bubble inflation model accounting only for the perturbations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) , and for the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( w83 ) . each of these tables corresponds to a different pair of values . the first two columns in these tables record and , and the third column is the cosmological baryonic - matter fraction . the fourth column gives the value of the matter power spectrum scaling parameter ( sugiyama 1995 ) , which is used to parameterize approximate analytic fits to the power spectra derived from numerical integration of the perturbation equations . the quantities listed in columns ( 1)(4 ) of these tables are sensitive only to the global parameters of the cosmological model . columns ( 5 ) and ( 8) of tables 912 give the dmr data 2- range of that is used to normalize the perturbations in the models considered here . the numerical values in table 12 are for gyr , . we did not analyze the dmr data using s for these models , and in this case the perturbations are normalized to the values from the gyr , analyses . ( as discussed above , shifts in and do not greatly alter the inferred normalization amplitude . ) columns ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 give the 2- range of ] entries of columns ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 may be summarized by the fitting formulae listed in table 14 . these fitting formulae are more accurate than expressions for ] values for spectra of types ( 1)(3 ) above . clearly , there is no significant observational difference between the predictions for the different spectra . in what follows , for the open - bubble inflation model we concentrate on the type ( 1 ) spectrum above . again , the ranges in tables 914 are those determined from the maximal 2- range . table 15 lists central dmr - normalized \" values for ] , with 2- range : where we have added the uncertainty due to the assumed cosmological model and due to the assumed evolution in quadrature with the statistical 1- uncertainty ( maddox et al . 1996 , eq . ) , and doubled to get the 2- uncertainty . the range of eq . ( 18 ) is consistent with that determined from eqs . ( 7.33 ) and ( 7.73 ) of peebles ( 1993 ) . the local abundance of rich clusters , as a function of their x - ray temperature , provides a tight constraint on ] for fiducial cdm , which is at the - limit of eq . ( as discussed in ecf , this is because vl normalize to the cluster temperature function at 7 kev , where there is a rise in the temperature function . ) this is one reason why llrv favour a higher value of for the open - bubble inflation model than did grsb . ] . this is because ecf use observational data over a larger range in x - ray temperature to constrain , and also use n - body computations at 0.3 and 1 to calibrate the press - schechter model ( which is used in their determination of the constraints ) . furthermore , ecf also make use of hydrodynamical simulations of a handful of individual clusters in the fiducial cdm model  to calibrate the relation between the gas temperature and the cluster mass , and then use this calibrated relation for the computations at all values of . the initial conditions for all the simulations were set using the analytical approximation to , so again it might be of interest to see whether the wiggles in the numerically integrated could significantly affect the determination of the constraints of eq . kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) use x - ray cluster data , and a method that allows for the fact that clusters need not have formed at the redshift at which they are observed , to directly constrain the value of for cdm cosmogonies normalized by the dmr two - year data . their conclusions are in resonable accord with what would be found by using eq . ( 19 ) ( derived assuming that observed clusters are at their redshifts of formation ) . however , kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) note that evolution from the redshift of formation to the redshift of observation can affect the conclusions , so a more careful comparison of these two results is warranted . the boldface entries in columns ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 indicate those model - parameter values whose predictions are inconsistent with the constraints of eq . ( 19 ) ( 1- ) uncertainty of eq . ( 19 ) , approximate analyses based on using the analytic bbks approximation to the transfer function should make use of the more accurate parameterization of eq . ( 13 ) ( rather than that with in the exponent ) , as this gives ] ( 2- ) . it might be significant that the large - scale peculiar velocity observational data constraint is somewhat discordant with ( higher than ) the cluster temperature function constraint . since is less sensitive to smaller length scales ( compared to ] holds exactly , i.e. , they ignore the uncertainty in the rms fractional perturbation in galaxy number , which is presumably of the order of that in eq . ( 18 ) . as the constraints from the deduced values , eq . ( 21 ) , are not yet as restrictive as those from other large - scale structure measures , we do not pursue this issue in our analysis here . the boldface entries in columns ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) of tables 912 indicate those model - parameter values whose predictions are inconsistent with the constraints of eq . ( 21 ) . the boldface entries in tables 912 summarize the current constraints imposed by the observational data discussed in the previous section on the model - parameter values for the open - bubble inflation model ( spectra of type above ) , and for the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( type above ) . the current observational constraints on the models are not dissimilar , but this is mostly a reflection of the uncertainty on the constraints themselves since the model predictions are fairly different . in the following discussion of the preferred part of model - parameter space we focus on the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) . note from table 13 that the large - scale structure predictions of the open - bubble inflation model do not depend on perturbations generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and also do not depend significantly on the contribution from the non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) . table 9 corresponds to the part of parameter space with maximized \" small - scale power in matter fluctuations . this is accomplished by picking a low gyr ( and so large ) , and by picking a low ( this is the lower 2- limit from standard nucleosynthesis and the observed he , li , and high d abundances , fkot ) . the tightest constraints on the model - parameter values come from the matter power spectrum observational data constraints on the shape parameter ( table 9 , col . ) , and from the cluster x - ray temperature function observational data constraints on ] , while ecf conclude that at 2- the observational data requires that this be at least 0.74 , so an case fails this test . the constraints on ( col . ) are not as restrictive as those on ] favours a larger while the observed cluster baryonic - mass fraction favours a smaller , and so are in conflict . table 10 gives the predictions for the gyr , models . this value of is consistent with the 2- range determined from standard nucleosynthesis and the observed he and li abundances : ( fkot , also see copi et al . 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . it is , however , somewhat difficult to reconcile with the 2- range derived from the observed he , li , and current high d abundances ( fkot ) , or with that from the current observed low d abundances ( burles & tytler 1996 ) . in any case , the observed d abundances are still under discussion , and must be viewed as preliminary . in this case , open - bubble inflation models with are consistent with the observational constraints . the current central observational data values for and favour , while that for the cluster baryonic - mass fraction prefers , and that for ] , and favour , so the agreement with observational data is fairly impressive , and could even be improved by reducing a little to raise . table 12 gives the predictions for another part of model - parameter space . here we show models ( at gyr ) , consistent with the central value of determined from standard nucleosynthesis using the observed he , li , and high d abundances ( fkot ) . the larger value of ( compared to table 9 ) eases the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint , which now requires only . the increase in also decreases the mass fluctuation amplitude , making it more difficult to argue for ; however , models with seem to be consistent with the observational constraints when and gyr . it is interesting that in this case the central observational data values we consider for , for ] . ] we however strongly emphasize that the central value of the large - scale flow results of bertschinger et al . ( 1990 ) does favour a significantly larger value of than the rest of the data we have considered here . furthermore , as discussed in detail in grsb , there is some uncertainty in how to properly interpret large - scale velocity data in the open models , particularly given the large sample variance associated with the measurement of a single bulk velocity ( bond 1996 , also see llrv ) . a more careful analysis , as well as more observational data , is undoubtedly needed before it will be possible to robustly conclude that the large - scale velocity data does indeed force one to consider significantly larger values of than is favoured by the rest of the observational constraints ( and hence rules out the models considered here ) . it might be significant that on comparing the mass power spectrum deduced from a refined set of peculiar velocity observations to the galaxy power spectrum determined from the apm survey , kolatt & dekel ( 1995 ) estimate that for the optically - selected apm galaxies with a 2- range , ( note that it has been argued that systematic uncertainties preclude a believable determination of from a comparison of the observed large - scale peculiar velocity field to the 1.2 jy galaxy distribution , davis , nusser , & willick 1996 . ) this range is consistent with other estimates now under discussion . the stromlo - apm comparison of loveday et al . ( 1996 ) indicates , with a 2- upper limit of 0.75 , while baugh ( 1996 ) concludes that ( 2- ) , and ratcliffe et al . ( 1996 ) argue for . using the apm range for ] . this normalization is somewhat smaller than that indicated by the dmr data ( e.g. , ratra & sugiyama 1995 ) . while bahcall & oh ( 1996 ) did not compare the cluster peculiar velocity function data to the predictions of the open - bubble inflation model , approximate estimates indicate that this data is consistent with the open - bubble inflation model predictions for the range of favoured by the other data we consider in see the ] , low - density cosmogonies form structure earlier than high density ones . thus observations of structure at high redshift may be used to constrain the matter density . as benchmarks , we note that scaling from the results of the numerical simulations of cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) , in a open model with = 0.8 ] values ( for this favoured range of ) with the larger observed galaxy number fluctuations ( e.g. , eq . ) . in common with the low - density flat- cdm model , we have established that in the low - density open - bubble cdm model one may adjust the value of to accommodate a large fraction of present observational constraints . for a broad class of these models , with adiabatic gaussian initial energy - density perturbations , this focuses attention on values of that are larger than the range of values for inferred from the observed light - element abundances in conjunction with standard nucleosynthesis theory . whether this additional cdm is nonbaryonic , or is simply baryonic material that does not take part in standard nucleosynthesis , remains a major outstanding puzzle for these models . we acknowledge the efforts of those contributing to the -dmr . is supported by the office of space sciences of nasa headquarters . we also acknowledge the advice and assistance of c. baugh , s. cole , j. garriga , t. kolatt , c. park , l. piccirillo , g. rocha , g. tucker , d. weinberg , and k. yamamoto . rs is supported in part by a pparc grant and kbn grant 2p30401607 . 1.fractional differences , , between the cmb spatial anisotropy multipole coefficients computed using the two boltzmann transfer codes ( and normalized to agree at ) . heavy type is for the open -

{"article": "formation and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of molecules have recently been achieved based on ultracold atoms with magnetically - tuned feshbach resonances . in these experiments , feshbach coupling is induced by tuning a foreign molecular state near the scattering continuum , which allows for an efficient transfer of colliding atoms into molecules . this method works for virtually all alkali atoms , and can create ultracold molecules from various sources including bose condensates , degenerate fermi gases , or normal thermal gases . feshbach molecules have special and unique properties . they typically populate only one weakly - bound quantum state , and the bound state can strongly couple to the scattering continuum via feshbach resonance . we may ask the following question : should feshbach molecules rather be considered as molecules in a specific rovibrational state or as pairs of scattering atoms near the continuum ? this distinction is particularly crucial in the studies of the bec to bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer state ) crossover in degenerate fermi gases , which call for a clarification of the quantum nature of the feshbach molecules . molecular states near feshbach resonances have been recently investigated based on sophisticated and complete two - body or many - body theory and multi - channel scattering calculations . all works suggest that the feshbach molecule is generally a coherent mixture of the foreign molecule in the closed channel and long - range atom pair in the open scattering channel . near resonances with large resonance widths , the molecules can be well approximated as pairs in the open channel . for narrow resonances , as suggested by numerical calculation , the closed channel dominates and a short - range molecule picture is appropriate . in this paper , we use a simple two - channel model to describe two interacting atoms near a feshbach resonance ( sec . ii ) . to account for the finite interaction range of real atoms , we introduce a spherical box potential , which allows us to analytically calculate the molecular bound state in different regimes and their threshold behavior ( sec . iii and sec . iv ) . finally , we apply our model to feshbach molecules in recent fermi gas experiments and to characterize the associated feshbach resonances ( sec . we model the interaction of two identical , ultracold atoms with mass based on an open channel that supports the scattering continuum and a closed channel that supports the foreign bound state . the wave function of the atoms is generally expressed as , where and are the amplitudes in the open and closed channels , respectively , and is the inter - atomic separation . we assume the interaction is described by a spherical box potential with an interaction range of , see fig . ( 1 ) . for , the potential energy of the open channel is 0 and the closed channel . for , the open ( closed ) channel has an attractive potential of , and a coupling term between the channels . the wave function satisfies the schrdinger equation : . a bound state with energy relative to the scattering continuum is supported by the closed channel.,width=211 ] the solution of the above equation for zero scattering energy can be expressed as : where the scattering length and are constants , are the eigen wave numbers \" for associated with the eigen states . based on the boundary conditions and , we get the latter equation shows how in general , each channel contributes to the scattering length . in cold atom systems , feshbach resonances are , in most cases , induced by hyperfine interactions or spin - spin interactions . both interactions are many orders of magnitude weaker than the relevant short range exchange potential . it is an excellent approximation to assume and . hence , we have , and . in this limit , the closed channel contribution is significant only when the foreign state is close to the continuum , in which case the last term in eq . ( 7 ) diverges . given the energy of the closed channel state as and , the boundary condition allows us to expand the last term in eq . ( 7 ) as . here characterizes the feshbach coupling strength . to the same order of expansion , the middle term in eq . ( 7 ) is a constant across the resonance and can be identified as , where is the background scattering length . equation ( 7 ) reduces to experimentally , the relative energy between the continuum and the bare state can be adjusted linearly by a magnetic field -induced zeeman shift , where and is the magnetic moment of the open(closed ) channel . replacing by , we can rewrite eq . ( 8) in terms of the magnetic field as where the resonance width and the resonance position are given by several interesting features are shown here . first of all , we find the resonance width is proportional to both the feshbach coupling and the background scattering properties . the latter dependence is due to the fact that the scattering amplitude at short range is proportional to the scattering length . a larger short range scattering amplitude leads to a stronger coupling to the closed channel . secondly and importantly , the resonance position is offset by exactly relative to the crossing of the bare state and the continuum , , see eq . ( 11 ) . for a positive scattering length , this shift is negative . this feature leads to the renormalization \" of the feshbach resonance location discussed in ref . . to understand the origin of the resonance shift , we should return to eq . the divergence of the scattering length occurs when the open channel contribution ( middle term ) is exactly canceled by the closed channel one ( last term ) . for systems with large background scattering lengths and strong feshbach couplings , this cancelation can occur even when the bare state is far away from the continuum . a large resonance shift then results . now we turn to the binding energy of the molecules . assuming a bound eigen state exists near the continuum at , where is the binding energy , we can determine by following essentially the same calculation as eq . ( 1)-(7 ) . the equivalence of eq . ( 7 ) gives where . assuming and the bound states in both channels are close to the continuum , namely , and , we can expand the two terms on the right side of eq . ( 12 ) to leading order as and , respectively . equation ( 12 ) then reduces to this result shows the evolution of the eigen state near the resonance . similar result is obtained in ref . based on a contact potential . we can immediately see that in the absence of the feshbach coupling , the solutions of eq . ( 13 ) are and ( for ) , which exactly correspond to the bare bound states in the closed channel and the open channel ( for ) , respectively . in the presence of the feshbach coupling , eq . ( 13 ) suggests an avoided level crossing \"- like energy structure , see fig . ( 2 ) , which also illustrates the resonance position shifts . the level crossing , however , is not hyperbolic as it is in a two - level system . in particular , at small binding energies , the bound state energy approaches the continuum quadratically , see fig . ( 2 ) inset . far below the continuum , the bound state approaches the bare state in the closed channel . , solid lines ) . we assume ( a ) and and ( b ) and , where can be any relevant length scale . arrows mark the offset resonance positions . insets show the threshold behavior of the bound state.,width=268 ] to better quantify the role of the open and closed channel , we can write the wave function of the eigen state as and , with our approximations , satisfies and the mixing angle is defined below . we show in eq . ( 15 ) that the eigen state generally occupies both the closed channel and open channel . we can introduce a mixing amplitude as the amplitude in the closed channel the mixing fraction can be evaluated by a direct integration of the closed channel wave function . alternatively , noticing that the mixing also leads to a dependence of the eigen state on the bare state , we can also derive from the dependence of on , or from the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule . all methods lead to the same result despite the seemingly complex equations shown in previous sections , the feshbach molecules are simple and universal near the scattering continuum . expanding eq . ( 13 ) with small and using eq . ( 9)-(11 ) , we find the binding energy of the feshbach molecules has a simple dependence on the scattering length and increases quadratically in magnetic field near the resonance , namely , where . equation ( 20 ) shows identical dependence on scattering length and interaction range as of single channel molecules in the threshold regime . furthermore , taking the limit in eq . ( 14 ) and ( 19 ) , we find the molecular wave function here is purely in the open channel . its spatial extent is determined by quantum uncertainty , , and can be much larger than the interaction range . in this limit , the feshbach molecules are identical to long - range atom pairs in a single open channel . by expanding eq . ( 19 ) at small and using eq . ( 13 ) , we find the closed channel fraction can be expressed as where . from eq . ( 22 ) , we see that provides the leading order estimation of the closed channel admixture . when or ( this condition applies when ) , the feshbach molecule is purely in the open channel . as expected , the threshold regime is wider for resonances with larger and . we can further determine the open channel - dominated \" regime by setting in eq . ( 19 ) . for resonances with small , this condition corresponds to , which , in terms of magnetic field , maps to only a small fraction of near the resonance . for resonances with large , the open channel dominates when , which covers the full resonance width when , and covers the entire upper branch of the bound state when . based on the range of the single channel regime , we suggest the broad(narrow ) resonances be defined as those with  . within the width of the feshbach resonance , the molecules associated with a broad ( narrow ) resonance are better described as long range pairs in the open channel ( short range molecules in the closed channel ) . we note that this definition is purely based on two - body physics . .parameters of the li and k feshbach resonances . interaction range is derived from ref . , see text . feshbach coupling is derived from eq . is bohr radius and is bohr magneton . ( dotted lines ) and mixing fractions ( solid lines ) of the molecules near the li and k feshbach resonances . the curves are calculated from eq . ( 13 ) , eq . ( 19 ) and the parameters in table 1 . binding energies from multi - channel calculation ( dashed lines ) , from jila group measurement ( open square ) and the mixing fractions measurement from rice group ( open circles ) are shown for comparison . the shaded areas indicate the typical bec - bcs crossover regimes , .,width=268 ] finally , we apply our model to the li and k feshbach molecules created in recent bec - bcs experiments . these molecules are stable near the resonance and both the molecular binding energies and the scattering lengths have been well measured and studied . to model the interaction of atoms , we adopt , , and from recent measurements and numerical calculations . to account for the finite range of the atomic interaction , which at low temperatures is determined by the van der waals potential of , we choose the interaction range in our model to be the mean scattering length defined in ref . this choice ensures the same behavior of the scattering length in the threshold regime . all parameters are given in table i. in fig . ( 3 ) , we show the calculated binding energy and the mixing fraction of the feshbach molecules for the two li resonances and one k resonance . the results agree very well with the multi - channel calculation and the measurements on molecular binding energy , magnetic moment and mixing fraction . both the li resonance at 834 g and the k resonance are broad with and , respectively . the open channel - dominated regimes of 210 mhz for the 834 g li resonance is also larger than the fermi energy of 20 khz in the experiments.(here the fermi wave number is . ) for the k resonance , the full upper branch of the molecular state is open channel dominated with mixing fractions less than . therefore , we conclude the open channel description of these feshbach molecules in the crossover regime to be a good approximation . for the narrower li resonance at g , we obtain and 31 hz 20 khz . this indicates an extremely narrow open channel regime of less than 50 g near the resonance , where the gas parameter is still over . crossover experiments based on these feshbach molecules can not be described by open channel atom pairs and may lead to qualitatively different physics . we attribute the large difference between the two li resonances to their different couplings and very different background scattering length , see table i. in the above discussions , we note that fermi energy is an external parameter which depends on the density of the sample . whether the molecules in the crossover regime can be described by single channel strongly depends on the density . the parameter , however , provides a better and independent measure to classify feshbach resonances . we find that the two feshbach resonances in li are the two extremes of broad and narrow resonances with and . in summary , the two - channel model provides a simple picture to understand the molecular state near the feshbach resonances . the analytic results of the molecular binding energy and mixing fraction on li and k agree with the measurements and other sophisticated calculations very well . based on the threshold behavior of the bound state , we suggest a dimensionless parameter to assess the broadness \" of the feshbach resonance . we thank p.s . julienne and n. nygaard for stimulating discussions and r. grimm s lithium and cesium groups in innsbruck for the support during our visit . the author is partially supported by the lise - meitner program of the austrian science fund ( fwf ) . s. jochim , m. bartenstein , a. altmeyer , g. hendl , s. riedl , c. chin , j. hecker denschlag and r. grimm , science * 302 * , 2101 ( 2003 ) ; m. greiner , c.a . regal , d.s . jin , nature * 426 * , 537 ( 2003 ) ; m. zwierlein , c.a . stan , c.h . schunck , s.m.f . raupach , s. gupta , z. hadzibabic , and w. ketterle , phys . 91 * , 250401 ( 2003 ) . j. herbig , t. kraemer , m. mark , t. weber , c. chin , h .- c . ngerl , and r. grimm , science * 301 * , 1510 ( 2003 ) ; s. drr , t. volz , a. marte , and g. rempe phys . rev . * 92 * , 020406 ( 2004 ) ; k. xu , t. mukaiyama , j.r . abo - shaeer , j.k . chin , d. miller , and w. ketterle , phys . rev . lett . * 91 * , 210402 ( 2003 ) . b. marcelis , e.g.m . van kempen , b.j . verhaar , and s.j.j.m.f . kokkelmans , phys . a * 70 * , 012701 ( 2004 ) ; s.j.j.m.f . kokkelmans , j.n . milstein , m.l . chiofalo , r. walser , and m.j . holland , phys . a * 65 * , 053617 ( 2002 ) .", "summary": "we present a two - channel model to describe the quantum state of two atoms with finite - range interaction near a feshbach resonance . this model provides a simple picture to analytically derive the wave function and the binding energy of the molecular bound state . the results agree excellently with the measurements and multichannel calculations . for small binding energies , the system enters a threshold regime in which the feshbach molecules are identical to long range atom pairs in single channel . according to their threshold behavior , we find feshbach resonances can be classified into two types ."}

{"article": "the time varying stern - gerlach , sg , interaction of a relativistic fermion with an e.m . wave has been proposed to separate beams of particles with opposite spin states corresponding to different energies . we will show how spin polarized particle will exchange energy with the electromagnetic field of an rf resonator . let us denote with the coordinates of a particle in the laboratory , and with the coordinates in the particle rest frame , prf . in the latter the sg force that represents the action of an inhomogeneous magnetic field on a particle endowed with a magnetic moment is f sg = (^ * b ) = x ( ^ * b ) + y ( ^ * b ) + z ( ^ * b ) with = ge2 m s . here is the elementary charge with for protons and positrons , , and for antiprotons and electrons , , making and either parallel or antiparallel to each other , respectively . is the rest mass of the particle , the gyromagnetic ratio and the anomaly defined as a = g-22 = \\ { ll 1.793 ( g=5.586 ) & p,|p + + 1.160 10 ^ -3 & e^ .. notice that in eq. we have defined the magnetic moment as in the rest frame , rather than as . in the rest frame the quantum vector , or spin , has modulus and its component parallel to the magnetic field lines can only take the following values s m=(-s , -s+1, .... ,s-1 , s ) , where is the reduced planck s constant . combining eqs. and  we obtain for the magnetic moment in the prf = ||=g|e|4 m = \\ { l 1.41 10 ^ -26 jt^-1 + + 9.28 10 ^ -24 jt^-1 .. for a particle traveling along the axis , the lorentz transformations of the differential operators and of the force yield \\ { lll x = x & y = y & z = ( z + c t ) + + f = 1f & f = f & ( f z = f z ) .. the force  is boosted to the laboratory system as f sg = 1 x ( ^ * b ) + 1 y ( ^ * b ) + z ( ^ * b ) . because of the lorentz transformation of the fields and \\ { l e = ( e + cb ) - ^2 + 1(e ) + + b = ( b - ce ) - ^2 + 1(b ) .. the energy in the rest frame becomes ( ^ * b ) = ^* x ( b x + ce y ) + ^* y ( b y - ce x ) + ^* zb z . combining eqs. and  , by virtue of eq. , after some algebra we can finally obtain the sg force components in the laboratory frame : \\ { l f x = ^* x(b xx + c e yx ) + ^* y(b yx - c e xx ) + 1^* zb zx + + f y = ^* x(b xy + c e yy ) + ^* y(b yy - c e xy ) + 1^* zb zy + + f z = ^* xc zx + ^* yc zy + ^* zc zz , . with \\ { l c zx = ^2 + + c zy = ^2 + + c zz = ( b zz + c b zt ) .. these results can also be obtained from the quantum relativistic theory of the spin- charged particle . let us introduce the dirac hamiltonian h = e+ c(p - ea ) + 0 mc^2 having made use of the dirac s matrices =  , 0 =  , = 0 =  , where is a vector whose components are the pauli s matrices x =  , y =  , z =  , is the identity matrix , the null matrix and having chosen the -axis parallel to the main magnetic field . a standard derivation leads to the non relativistic expression of the hamiltonian exhibiting the sg interaction with the `` normal '' magnetic moment = e+ ( p - ea)^2 - ( b ) which coincides with the pauli equation and is valid in the prf . to complete the derivation we must add the contribution from the anomalous magnetic moment to the sg energy term in the previous equation , with a factor , yielding - b = - ^ * b ^ * = g . in order to obtain the -component of the sg force in the laboratory frame along the direction of motion of the particle , we must boost the whole pauli term of eq. by using the unitary operator in the hilbert space , which expresses the lorentz transformation u^-1 u = g( 0b ) that can be written in terms of the equivalent transformation in the spinor space s = = +  with = , u = = = , u = (= ) . from eqs. and  , due to the algebraic structure of the and matrices , we obtain in the laboratory frame the three components of the sg force \\ { lll s^-1 ( 0 x ) s & = & 0 x + s^-1 ( 0 y ) s & = & 0 y + s^-1 ( 0 z ) s & = & ( 0 z ) + i 0 5 . , with 5 = x y z 0 = i  . from eqs. we can deduce the expectation values of the sg force in the laboratory system with a defined spin -along the -axis in our case- via the expectation values of the pauli matrices and of the pauli interaction term of the proper force f z = 0 y^2^*. in our case only the second of eqs. gives a non vanishing result , while both the first and third produce a null contribution to the force , because of the orthogonality of the two spin states and the properties of the matrices . let us consider the standing waves built up inside a rectangular radio - frequency resonator , tuned to a generic te mode . resonator dimensions are : width , height and length , as shown in fig. . on the cavity axis , which coincides with the beam axis , the electric and magnetic fields are \\\\ \\\\ b x & = & -

b 0  t + + e x(z , t ) = -b 0  t .. it is important to emphasize that in all the field components met so far there is a clear separation between spatial and temporal contributions , as typical of standing waves . besides , the boundary conditions of the electric and magnetic fields of the e.m . dictate the shape of the spatial component which , in turn , oscillates in time with the frequency . then , at the cavity entrance and exit the field components  become on axis \\ { l b y(0,t ) = -b 0 t + + e x(0,t ) = 0 .. and \\ { l b y(d , t ) = -b 0 t = b 0 t + + e x(d , t ) = -t = 0 .. where is a generic time . the null values of at the cavity ends confirm a typical pattern of the transverse electric mode . from eq. , after some algebra , we obtain tha a charged fermion which crosses a radio - frequency resonator , tuned on the te mode , acquires ( or loses ) an energy amount when interacts with the field component in the `` body '' of the cavity shown in fig . ( u ) = 0^df z dz = 0^d^*c zydz = ^2 ^ 2 b 0^ * ( 1 + ) still assuming that the spin is not precessing . however , since the cavity can not be completely enclosed but must have apertures at both ends to allow the particle bean to pass through and consequently will have fringe fields , in order to calculate the full sg interaction it is necessary to deal with the interaction with these fields . this is discussed right below . in order to fulfill the boundary conditions  and  , a cavity tuned in its mode must be exactly filled by either an even or an odd number of cavity dependent half wave - lengths , eq. , as illustrated in figs . and . consider now a bunch of particles crossing the cavity in synchronism with the rf field . this requires that the bunch centre of mass that enters the cavity at the instant and would leave the cavity at , at magnetic field values , respectively b y(0,0 ) = -b 0 b y(d , ) = b 0 the field values at both ends fade rapidly to zero over a small distance just outside the cavity ( see figures . ) we may consider these fringe fields as small - valued functions in the -plane , since the time necessary for a particle to proceed through this distances can be very small in comparison with , depending of course by the size of the beam channel , or \\ { llllll & = & -b 0g(z ) & & g(-)=0 , & g(0)=1 + + & = & b 0h(z ) & & h(d)=1 , & h(d+)=0 .. under these conditions , a relativistic fermion with its spin directed along the -axis and traversing the cavity will experience a sg force parallel to the -axis ( direction of motion ) , see eq. f z = ^ * c zy where is given by the second of the set of eqs. . for the moment we assume that the spin will conserve its orientation during traversal the electric field and its derivatives in this equation are almost constantly zero , because of the boundary conditions on the walls of the cavity and at the extreme points and . furthermore , the function is almost zero along the fringe segments because of its proportionality to , with equal to the mentioned before . consequently we have c zy ^2 , and for the entire fringe field \\ { lll & = & -b 0^*^2  + + & = & b 0^*^2  .. making use of eqs .  and  , the energy increments {\\m in} ] related to the fringe fields are easily evaluated since the integrals and only depend upon the extreme points  and do not depend on the curve that connects them . in fact becomes an exact differential . then we obtain for the energy exchange at both edges ( u ) = ( u ) = - b 0^*^2 . the total energy exchange at the edges is therefore ( u ) = ( u ) + ( u ) = - 2b 0^*^2 . by adding the fringe contributions  to the cavity body crossing contribution  seen before , obtain ( u ) = ( u ) + ( u) x = -^2 b 0^ * f ( , ) with f ( , ) = . for ultra relativistic particles  eq .  reduces to ( u ) -^2 b 0^ * ( 1- ) . this last result deserves a few comments . in fact , if we set = 2 d = = the total energy contribution  vanishes , implying a full cancellation of the effect . on the other hand if we set = the total energy contribution  becomes ( u ) -2 ^ 2 b 0^ * as deduced from eq. . in table i we gather values calculated from eq. for non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic particles for , either or at two proton energies . each is accompanied by the corresponding ratio cavity - length over cavity - height . * table i : * furthermore , if we consider two contiguous cavities , there will be a gradient between the positive at the end of the first cavity and a negative at the beginning of the second cavity , as shown in fig . . in this case we may consider the magnetic field at the interface as linearly dependent on , that is reiterating what done before , obtain rcl & = & -2b 0 + + f z & = & -2b 0^*^2 + + ( u ) = ( u ) & = & -^f z dz = -2b 0^ * ^2 = -2b 0^*^2 which means that , for cavities , we shall have as final result for ultra relativistic particles ( u ) = n(u ) - ( n-1)(u ) - ( u ) = \\ { ll 0 & ph = 2 + + b 0^*^2 & ph = 3 .. conversely , if is even , particles with their spin pointing always in the same direction can not exchange energy with the standing wave of a te resonator . a spin rotator can align the particle magnetic moments either parallel or anti - parallel to the directions of the magnetic field gradients , thus allowing the desired energy interaction . this situation would be similar to what happens in a multi - stage tandem van de graaff , where the ions are repetitively accelerated by the same electrostatic field , becoming alternatively negative , via an addition of electrons , or positive , via electron stripping . unfortunately , the field integral ( tm , for ) for attaining a spin rotation is so large that this solution is unpractical . instead , the example of equal to an odd number seems much more suitable since does not require cumbersome magnets , but only longer cavities ( compare eqs .  and  ) . in fact , the magnetic moments are ( de)accelerated by the field tails at the cavity ends , while do nt change their energy when crossing the cavities . this situation resembles the wideroe linac where the charged particles are accelerated by the electric fields between two contiguous drift tubes , but do nt change their energy while crossing the tubes themselves . on the basis of the previous estimates , we feel ready to propose the time varying sg interaction as a method for attaining a spin state separation of an unpolarized beam of , say ( anti)protons , since the energy of particles with opposite spin orientations will differ and beams in the two states can be separated . in a first stage of the study of a sensible practical design , we intend to proceed with numerical simulations . as a first step , we intend to verify the correctness of eqs. and  setting once and then , in a cavity where the field line pattern can be realistically controlled . beyond the verification of the present theory , there is also the aim of studying the effects generated by the spin precession inside the cavity , that we did not yet address in this note . next , we shall consider a spin splitter scheme based on the lattice of an existing or planned ( anti)proton ring endowed with an array of splitting cavities . the principal aim of the latter implementations is to check the mixing effect of the longitudinal phase - plane filamentation , i.e. the actual foe which could frustrate the entire spin splitting process . first , we want to thank waldo mackay , who has participated on so many discussions on the whole idea but who was regrettably prevented by numerous commitments from participate to the editing of the present note . we thank renzo parodi for his help for us to better understand the subtleties of the standing waves building up . thanks are also due to chris tschalaer for fruitful discussions on the role of the fringe fields . m. conte , m. ferro , g. gemme , w.w . mackay , r. parodi , m. pusterla : the stern -

{"article": "excitons in semiconductors have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations of bose condensation . low - energy exciton - exciton interactions are characterized by the exciton - exciton scattering length , , which determines the thermodynamics of a low density gas and is crucial for modeling the thermalization time of a dilute exciton gas . despite its importance , the exciton - exciton scattering length is an elusive quantity , being difficult to measure experimentally or to estimate theoretically . as is well - known in atomic physics , scattering lengths can be extremely sensitive to the details of the interactions between particles . in particular , the existence of a weakly bound or nearly bound state causes the scatter length to become quite large . therefore , a priori one should suspect that exciton - exciton scattering may be a very material dependent property of semiconductors . reliable theoretical predictions of exciton - exciton scatting lengths require both a very accurate hamiltonian for the semiconductor , and an accurate solution to the ( four - particle ) scattering problem . in this paper we provide an essentially exact solution to exciton - exciton scattering for a commonly used single - band effective mass hamiltonian . this solution allows us to study three important questions : ( 1 ) how sensitive is the scattering length to the mass ratio , ( 2 ) how does the scattering length depend on spin states ( singlet or triplet ) of the scattering excitons , and ( 3 ) to what degree can inter - exciton exchange of electrons or holes cause excitons to scatter into different spin states ? this calculations also serve as a benchmark for the single band limit of more complicated scattering hamiltonians . one experimental method for measuring the exciton scattering cross section is to look at line width broadening of the recombination spectra in a gas of excitons . collisions between excitons increase the line width , causing the line width to depend on the exciton - exciton scattering rate , , where is the density and is a typical exciton velocity . extracting cross sections from a line width requires that ( 1 ) the density and velocity distribution are known , and ( 2 ) elastic scattering is the fastest process . as discussed below , is a good material for comparison to the model studied in this work . et al. have performed such experiments on and have found a line width broadening that suggests an upper bound of on the scattering length . although our simulations do not exactly model , we will compare our results to this value . theoretical approaches to this problem start with the effective mass approximation , in which the system under consideration consists of two electrons , labeled and , and two holes , labeled and . the hamiltonian is where . the hamiltonian has symmetry under exchange of electrons and exchange of holes , so eigenstates may be denoted by two exchange quantum numbers . the s - wave states are symmetric under exchange of excitons ; a condition which is satisfied by states and , where the signs refer to ( anti)symmetry under exchange of electrons and holes , respectively . although this hamiltonian is a well - accepted model for exciton - exciton scattering , we should point out a few of its deficiencies . for small excitons , such as those in , that have radii not much larger than the lattice spacing , non - parabolic terms in the kinetic energy and other corrections to the potential energy may be necessary . for many semiconductors , such as si and ge , the valence band is a mixture of three bands and can not be described by a single parabolic band . in the case of , the valence band is the parabolic spin - orbit split off band , and there are fewer complications . interband exchange ( virtual electron - hole recombination ) is an important effect that has been neglected , and could be modeled by an additional spin - dependent potential term . this hamiltonian also describes a family of scattering processes for other particles , including hydrogen - hydrogen , positronium - positronium , and muonium - muonium scattering . the equal mass case is at an extreme ( positronium scattering ) , where the born - oppenheimer approximation is the least applicable . there have been several theoretical estimates of exciton - exciton scattering for bulk systems and quantum wells as well as calculations on biexciton - biexciton scattering, only the bulk , elastic scattering calculations are directly comparable to the results of this paper , but the techniques presented here could be generalized to the other scattering problems . also , the results presented here provide a benchmark for evaluating the approximations used in other theoretical treatments , and could lend insight into the reliability of the approximations in more complicated situations . one standard theoretical approach is diagrammatic perturbation theory , as presented in the work of keldysh and kolsov and haug and hanamura. they estimate the exciton - exciton scattering matrix as arising from a single term , , where represents a state of two noninteracting excitons with momentum and and is the inter - exciton coulomb interaction . this method gives an estimate of ( independent of the mass ratio ) , where is the exciton radius , but it is an uncontrolled approximation which may have limited validity in the low energy limit . one serious drawback of the method is that it does not include effects of the biexciton in the scattering . as we show later , biexciton vibrational states cause strong dependence of the scattering length on the mass ratio , which is not captured by the low order perturbation theory . a second common approach was developed by elkomoss and munchy, and uses an effective exciton - exciton potential defined by , where is the wavefunction for two free excitons a distance apart . the effective potential arises from the hartree term and is used in a two - particle central - field calculation . while an exciton - exciton scattering pseudo - potential would be a very useful tool , this approximate form has some serious drawbacks . among its deficiencies are a lack of correlation , no van der waals attraction , a failure to reproduce biexciton states , and a vanishing interaction potential for . the cross sections calculated by this method are small and lack qualitative agreement with the results of the present work . some insight into exciton - exciton scattering can be gained by considering the bound states , biexcitons . since the number of bound states , , enters in the phase shift at zero energy , , it is necessary that a good computation method for low energy scattering be able accurately calculate biexciton binding energies. for the mass ratios considered ( and far beyond , including deuterium ) the biexcitons can not bind in the states , so biexcitons in rotational states always have wavefunctions . detailed theoretical descriptions of biexcitons can be found in ref . the equal mass case was shown to have a bound biexciton by hyllerass and ore using a variational argument, and a better variational estimate of the binding energy was given by brinkman , rice and bell, who found , where is the exciton binding energy . however , because of the importance of correlation energy , the latter variational treatment was missing half of the biexciton binding energy , as shown by diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations, which find . dmc is a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method that uses a random walk to project out the ground state wavefunction from a variational wavefunction , in order to stochastically sample the exact ground state energy . the success of dmc for calculating biexciton energies has been a motivation for its use in the present scattering calculations . the -matrix approach to scattering is to examine the standing waves of the system . as shown by carlson , pandharipande , and wiringa and alhassid and koonin, by fixing nodes in the standing waves the scattering problem may be cast as a stationary state problem suitable for qmc methods . for an elastic scattering process , we label the distance between the products by , and the reduced mass of the products by . in exciton - exciton scattering there is a subtlety in the definition of r due to inter - exciton exchange , which we will address below in our discussion of the exciton - exciton scattering wavefunctions . nonetheless , for large separation , the relative motion of the products is free - particle like , so the many - body wavefunction depends on as , \\ ] ] where is the relative angular momentum , is the scattering momentum , and is the phase shift . if we constrain the wavefunction to have a node at a large exciton separation , we find a discrete energy spectrum , which may be computed by ground state or excited state methods , such as dmc . each choice of gives a spectrum of states , with energies that determine values of , where . the scattering matrix elements are determined by the phase shifts , - 1.\\ ] ] carlson has also proposed fixing the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction at the boundary instead of setting wavefunction to zero , were is the normal to the boundary surface , at a fixed radius , and parameterizes the boundary condition . this formulation has the advantage of separating the choice of simulation size ( subject to lying in the asymptotic region ) , from the sampling of energy , which is handled by varying , and is particularly well suited for finding the scattering length . the application to vmc calculations is straight - forward , but preserving the boundary condition in dmc calculations requires a method of images . the results presented here do not use the logarithmic - derivative boundary condition . the use of excited states is necessary when there is a bound state and , more generally , when the scattering state being studied has its first node before the asymptotic region is reached . we use a qmc method to calculate excited states developed by ceperley and bernu, to adapt vmc and dmc methods for a hilbert space of several low energy wavefunctions . a set of trial wavefunctions is chosen , . the generalized eigenvalue equation to be solved is, d {k\\beta}(t)=0 , \\ ] ] where is the eigenvector with eigenvalue and the matrices and are the overlap and hamiltonian matrices in our trial basis , given by the parameter is the projection time . the eigenvalues are energy eigenvalues within the hilbert space spanned by the projected trial functions , and approach the exact energy eigenvalues in the limit of large . the matrices and are sampled with random walks , using a guiding function which must be positive everywhere . the guiding function must have significant overlap with all basis functions , and should be optimized to decrease the variance of the sampled matrices . at each step in the random walk , the coordinates of the particles are updated using where is a normally distributed random variate with zero mean and unit variance and is the time step . in the limit of small , eq .  describes a process for sampling . the matrix element of is estimated by integrating the local energy of the guiding function , , along the random walk , }.\\ ] ] the estimators for matrices and are where and are the local energies of the trial basis states . , at large exciton - exciton separation . the asymptotic form of the -wave scattering states are symmetric  or antisymmetric  combinations of these configurations . this symmetric / antisymmetric form is used for the trial wavefunctions and , using and from eq .  . ] we now discuss the form for the exciton scattering functions and . as mentioned before , inter - exciton exchange of particles complicates the definition of exciton - exciton separation . there are two configurations for well - separated excitons , as shown in fig . . configuration i has the electrons and hole paired as , ; and configuration ii as , . we choose wavefunctions and to represent these states , where , and parameters in the function are variational . these wavefunctions represent two excitons in a relative s - wave state . since these are not eigenstates of the exchange operator for electrons or holes , , we take linear combinations of the two for our trial wavefunctions , and . for large separation of excitons , the exponential factors prohibit both configurations from simultaneously contributing to the wavefunction . thus , a node can be approximated in the scattering wavefunction by simply requiring that be zero for all . the error introduced by this approximation is of order , and is another limit on the use of small values for . since we only do calculations for low energy scattering , large , the lack of a well - defined exciton - exciton separation distance for short distances does not matter . of the dmc states relative to the vmc states as a function of dmc projection time , for basis states . the eigenvalue equation is given by eqs .  , where the hamiltonian and overlap matrices have been sampled using eqs .  and  . ] this method for calculating scattering properties is very sensitive to the energy spectra . to get accurate energies , we do not try to construct and optimize elaborate variational wavefunctions , but rather use dmc to project the energy from trial wavefunctions of the form given in eq .  . the coefficients , , , and are chosen to obey the cusp conditions on the wavefunction for small particle separations . the s - wave envelope functions are taken as solutions to an empirical exciton - exciton scattering potentials , where and have been self - consistently fit to approximate the energy spectrum of the four particle scattering states . we take the guiding function to have the same form as the wavefunctions with ^{1/2}$ ] . the parameters are chosen to bias sampling towards the collision : for states and for states to check for convergence of the energies in dmc , we plot the energy difference , , as a function of projection time in fig . . we see convergence after a projection time of 3 . , for ( a ) symmetric states , and ( b ) antisymmetric states , with . the lowest energy curve in ( a ) is the biexciton with binding energy . these functions determine the phase shifts and , by the relationship in eq .  . ] we thus find two energy spectra for each value of , as shown in figs . (a ) and (b ) . the spectra for the symmetric states , show a clearly bound biexciton state , as seen in fig . (a ) . the antisymmetric states , as shown in fig . (b ) , have no bound state . the binding energy of the biexciton is , in agreement with other ground state calculations , and is insensitive to the position of the node because it is localized . in contrast , the delocalized scattering states are quite sensitive to , and their dependence on is a measure of the elastic scattering matrix elements . for the two -wave scattering states , for , calculate using eq .  and the data from fig . . ] .coefficients for polynomomial fit to the low energy part of the phase shift functions for the case . the collision of two excitons with well defined initial and final spin states can be determined by decomposing the scattering events into the two channels , and . using the change of basis matrix ( table ) , we find , where the coefficients and for all non - zero s - wave scattering processes are given in table . the s - wave scattering cross sections are given by , where there is a factor of two enhancement due to the identical particle statistics . the spin - dependent cross sections take the form , , \\ ] ] where , , and depend on the initial and final spin states and are tabulated in table . the scattering lengths are given by , where the derivatives of the phase shifts are determined from the linear coefficients in table . ) , for exciton - exciton scattering with , for the processes : ( a ) singlet - singlet singlet - singlet , ( b ) triplet - triplet triplet - triplet for total spin ( dashed line ) and ( solid line ) , ( c ) triplet - singlet triplet - singlet with , and ( d ) triplet - triplet singlet - singlet and singlet - singlet triplet - triplet , both with . ] the calculated spin - dependent scattering lengths for the case are presented in the last column of table . these are the low - energy limit the cross - sections shown in fig . . in fig . we have plotted the s - wave scattering cross sections versus scattering momentum for the case and all non - zero spin configurations . fig . (a ) shows scattering of two singlet - excitons . scattering of two triplet - excitons is shown in fig . (b ) , where the solid line represents the spin aligned state , and the dashed line represents the state . the state scatters particularly strong because it has a large contribution from the channel , which is enhanced by the weakly bound biexciton . triplet - excitons in a relative state are spatially antisymmetric and thus have no s - wave scattering . we show s - wave scattering of triplet - excitons from singlet - excitons in fig . (c ) . this state has two distinguishable excitons , and can scatter by both s - wave and p - wave processes . as can be seen in table , the only contribution to the cross section is from the weaker channel . the coefficient for s - wave scattering is particularly small because only half the scattering process is symmetric ( s - wave ) , and there is an additional factor of one - half which cancels the identical particle factor . there is also an triplet- to singlet - exciton conversion cross section given in fig . (d ) . although this is an inelastic process in experimental situations , it conserves energy according to our model hamiltonian because we do not have an explicit interband spin coupling . the conversion of two triplet - excitons to two singlet - excitons can be understood as an inter - exciton exchange of a pair of electrons ( or holes ) . since the spins of the individual excitons do not correspond to symmetries of the hamiltonian , they need not remain constant during scattering . this conversion process is a physical consequence of the two inequivalent scattering channels and . this effect has been reported in experimental and theoretical work on exciton scattering in quantum wells . and as a function of the electron - hole mass ratio . the divergence in near is due to the appearance of second bound biexciton state . solid lines are a guide to the eye . ] the dependence of the cross sections on mass may be numerically studied by our methods . in fig . we show our calculated and as a function of mass ratio , . we find that the scattering length is remarkably insensitive to the mass ratio for ( corresponding to a wide range of semiconductors ) , but then diverges near . this feature is lost in previously published theoretical treatments of exciton - exciton scattering . the divergence in near is due to the acquisition of a biexciton vibrational state . for the biexciton has no bound excited states , while a molecule has 15 bound vibrational states . our calculations have shown the first of these appears near , with dramatic effects on the scattering length . the curve is relatively featureless because there are are no bound antisymmetric states in this range . we interpret the upward drift of for larger mass ratios as a systematic error due to difficulties in projecting states in excitonic systems with very different electron and hole masses . the heavy particle determines the projection time while the light particle determines the diffusion time step . the difficulty in handling large mass ratios make the method ( as presented here ) complementary to calculations that use the born - oppenheimer approximation . it is important to realize that similar relationships must exist between the scattering length and other material parameters , such as the luttinger - kohn parameters describing realistic hole states , external strain , and spin - orbit coupling , to name a few . theoretical studies of such effects will need similar high - accuracy scattering calculations , but applied to more accurate hamiltonians , and are an area for future research . to summarize , we have shown that there are several significant elastic scattering processes for excitons , and have given numerically exact values for a widely used theoretical model . we find strong triplet - triplet and singlet - singlet scattering , with weaker triplet - singlet scattering and triplet - triplet to singlet - singlet conversion processes . scattering is relatively insensitive to the mass ratio for , but becomes very sensitive and actually diverges near . dmc has been found be a good tool for this four - particle excited state calculation , since the detection of weakly bound states requires very accurate evaluation of the correlation energy . this computational approach should be extended in many ways . the extension to higher angular momentum states would give important corrections at higher scattering energies . application to biexciton - biexciton scattering are possible , but would be a bit more difficult because the scattering wavefunction would then have to describe eight interacting particles . most importantly , the method should be adapted to better hamiltonians so that the sensitivity of the scattering length to material properties for a wide range of materials can be studied . this approach should be quite useful for quantum well problems , which have similarities to the bulk problem study here , but have many more experimental parameters that can affect exciton - exciton interaction . we would like to thank k. ohara and j. carlson for useful discussions . this work was supported by nsf grant no . dmr 98 - 02373 , computer resources at ncsa , and the department of physics at the university of illinois urbana - champaign . for example , the location of the scattering length divergence at , reported later in this article , is extremely sensitive to an accurate treatment of correlation energy , since it relies on the appearance of a second , weakly bound biexciton state at that mass ratio .", "summary": "we calculate cross sections for low energy elastic exciton -

{"article": "inflation generically predicts a primordial spectrum of density perturbations which is almost precisely gaussian . in recent years the small non - gaussian component has emerged as an important observable , and will be measured with good precision by the planck surveyor satellite . in the near future , as observational data become more plentiful , it will be important to understand the non - gaussian signal expected in a wide variety of models , and to anticipate what conclusions can be drawn about early - universe physics from a prospective detection of primordial non - gaussianity . in this paper , we present a novel method for calculating the primordial non - gaussianity produced by super - horizon evolution in two - field models of inflation . our method is based on the real - space distribution of inflationary field values on a flat hypersurface , which can be thought of as a probability density function whose evolution is determined by a form of the collisionless boltzmann equation . using a cumulant representation to expand our density function around an exact gaussian , we derive ordinary differential equations which evolve the moments of this distribution . further , we show how these moments are related to observable quantities , such as the dimensionless bispectrum measured by . we present numerical results which show that this method gives good agreement with other techniques . it is not necessary to make any assumptions about the inflationary model beyond requiring a canonical kinetic term and applying the slow - roll approximation . while there are already numerous methods for computing the super - horizon contribution to , including the widely used formalism , we believe the one reported here has a number of advantages . first , this new technique is ideally suited to unraveling the various contributions to . this is because we follow the moments of the inflaton distribution directly , which makes it straightforward to identify large contributions to the skewness or other moments . the evolution equation for each moment is simple and possesses clearly identifiable source terms , which are related to the properties of the inflationary flow on field space . this offers a clear separation between two key sources of primordial non - gaussianity . one of these is the intrinsic non - linearity associated with evolution of the probability density function between successive flat hypersurfaces ; the other is a gauge transformation from field fluctuations to the curvature peturbation , . it would be difficult or impossible to observe this split within the context of other calculational schemes , such as the conventional formalism . a second advantage of our method is connected with the computational cost of numerical implementation . analytic formulas for are known in certain cases , mostly in the context of the framework , but only for very specific choices of the potential or hubble rate . these formulas become increasingly cumbersome as the number of fields increases , or if one studies higher moments . in the future , it seems clear that studies of complex models with many fields will increasingly rely on numerical methods . the numerical framework requires the solution to a number of ordinary differential equations which scales exponentially with the number of fields . since some models include hundreds of fields , this may present a significant obstacle . moreover , the formalism depends crucially on a numerical integration algorithm with low noise properties , since finite differences must be extracted between perturbatively different initial conditions after e - folds of evolution . thus , the background equations must be solved to great accuracy , since any small error has considerable scope to propagate . in this paper we ultimately solve our equations numerically to determine the evolution of moments in specific models . our method requires the solution to a number of differential equations which scales at most polynomially ( or in certain cases perhaps even linearly ) with the number of fields . it does not rely on extracting finite differences , and therefore is much less susceptible to numerical noise . these advantages may be shared with other schemes , such as the numerical method recently employed by lehners & renaux - petel . a third advantage , to which we hope to return in a future publication , is that our formalism yields explicit evolution equations with source terms . from an analysis of these source terms , we hope that it will be possible to identify those physical features of specific models which lead to the production of large non - gaussianities . this paper is organized as follows . in , we show how the non - gaussian parameter can be computed in our framework . the calculation remains in real space throughout ( as opposed to fourier space ) , which modifies the relationship between and the multi - point functions of the inflaton field . our expression for shows a clean separation between different contributions to non - gaussianity , especially between the intrinsic nonlinearity of the field evolution and the gauge transformation between comoving and flat hypersurfaces . in , we introduce our model for the distribution of inflaton field values , which is a moment expansion \" around a purely gaussian distribution . we derive the equations which govern the evolution of the moments of this distribution in the one- and two - field cases . in , we present a comparison of our new technique and those already in the literature . we compute numerically in several two - field models , and find excellent agreement between techniques . we conclude in . throughout this paper , we use units in which , and the reduced planck mass is set to unity . in this section , we introduce our new method for computing the non - gaussianity parameter . this method requires three main ingredients : a formula for the curvature perturbation , , in terms of the field values on a spatially flat hypersurface ; expressions for the derivatives of the number of e - foldings , , as a function of field values at horizon exit ; and a prescription for evolving the field distribution from horizon exit to the time when we require the statistical properties of . the first two ingredients are given in eqs . and , found at the end of and respectively . the final ingredient is discussed in . once it became clear that non - linearities of the microwave background anisotropies could be detected by the wmap and planck survey satellites , many authors studied higher - order correlations of the curvature perturbation . in early work , direct calculations of a correlation function were matched to the known limit of local non - gaussianity . this method works well if isocurvature modes are absent , so that the curvature perturbation is constant after horizon exit . in the more realistic situation that isocurvature modes cause evolution on superhorizon scales , all correlation functions become time dependent . various formalisms have been employed to describe this evolution . lyth & rodrguez extended the method beyond linear order . this method is simple and well - suited to analytical calculation . rigopoulos , shellard and van tent worked with a gradient expansion , rewriting the field equations in langevin form . the noise term was used as a proxy for setting initial conditions at horizon crossing . a similar ` exact ' gradient formalism was written down by langlois & vernizzi . in its perturbative form , this approach has been used by lehners & renaux - petel to obtain numerical results . another numerical scheme has been introduced by huston & malik . what properties do we require of a successful prediction ? consider a typical observer , drawn at random from an ensemble of realizations of inflation . in any of the formalisms discussed above , we aim to estimate the statistical properties of the curvature perturbation which would be measured by such an observer . some realizations may yield statistical properties which are quite different from the ensemble average , but these large excursions are uninteresting unless anthropic arguments are in play . next we introduce a collection of comparably - sized spacetime volumes whose mutual scatter is destined to dominate the microwave background anisotropy on a given scale . neglecting spatial gradients , each spacetime volume will follow a trajectory in field space which is slightly displaced from its neighbors . the scatter between trajectories is determined by initial conditions set at horizon exit , which are determined by promoting the vacuum fluctuation to a classical perturbation . a correct prediction is a function of the trajectories followed by every volume in the collection , taken as a whole . one never makes a prediction for a single trajectory . each spacetime volume follows a trajectory , which we label with its position at some fixed time , to be made precise below . throughout this paper , superscript ` ' denotes evaluation on a spatially flat hypersurface . consider the evolution of some quantity of interest , , which is a function of trajectory . if we know the distribution we can study statistical properties of such as the moment , ^m , \\ ] ] where we have introduced the ensemble average of , in eqs . , stands for a collection of any number of fields . it is the which are observable quantities . . defines what we will call the exact separate universe picture . it is often convenient to expand as a power series in the field values centered on a fiducial trajectory , labelled ` fid , ' when eq . is used to evaluate the , we refer to the ` perturbative ' separate universe picture . if all terms in the power series are retained , these two versions of the calculation are formally equivalent . in unfavorable cases , however , convergence may occur slowly or not at all . this possibility was discussed in refs . although our calculation is formally perturbative , it is not directly equivalent to eq . . we briefly discuss the relation of our calculation to conventional perturbation theory in . by definition , the curvature perturbation measures local fluctuations in expansion history ( expressed in e - folds ) , calculated on a comoving hypersurface . in many models , the curvature perturbation is synthesized by superhorizon physics , which reprocesses a set of gaussian fluctuations generated at horizon exit . in a single - field model , only one gaussian fluctuation can be present , which we label . neglecting spatial gradients , the total curvature perturbation must then be a function of alone . for , this can be well - approximated by where is independent of spatial position . defines the so - called `` local '' form of non - gaussianity . it applies only when quantum interference effects can be neglected , making a well - defined object rather than a superposition of operators . if this condition is satisfied , spatial correlations of may be extracted and it follows that can be estimated using the rule where we have recalled that is nearly gaussian , or equivalently that . with spatially independent , eq . strictly applies only in single - field inflation . in this case one can accurately determine by applying eq . to a single trajectory with fixed initial conditions , as in the method of lehners & renaux - petel . where more than one field is present , may vary in space because it depends on the isocurvature modes . in this case one must determine statistically on a bundle of adjacent trajectories which sample the local distribution of isocurvature modes . is then indispensible . following maldacena , and later lyth & rodrguez , we adopt eq . as our definition of , whatever its origin . in real space , the coefficient in eq . depends on the convention . more generally , this follows from the definition of , eq . . in fourier space , either prescription is automatically enforced after dropping disconnected contributions , again leading to eq . . to proceed , we require estimates of the correlation functions and . we first describe the conventional approach , in which ` ' denotes a flat hypersurface at a fixed initial time . the quantity denotes the number of e - foldings between this initial slice and a final comoving hypersurface , where indexes the species of light scalar fields . the local variation in expansion can be written in the fiducial picture as where . subject to the condition that the relevant scales are all outside the horizon , we are free to choose the initial time set by the hypersurface ` 'at our convenience . in the conventional approach , ` ' is taken to lie a few e - folds after our collection of spacetime volumes passes outside the causal horizon . this choice has many virtues . first , we need to know statistical properties of the field fluctuations only around the time of horizon crossing , where they can be computed without the appearance of large logarithms . second , as a consequence of the slow - roll approximation , the are uncorrelated at this time , leading to algebraic simplifications . finally , the formula subsumes a gauge transformation from the field variables to the observational variable . using eqs . , and , one finds that can be written to a good approximation where and for simplicity we have dropped the ` ' which indicates time of evaluation . a similar definition applies for . . is accurate up to small intrinsic non - gaussianities present in the field fluctuations at horizon exit . as a means of predicting it is pleasingly compact , and straightforward to evaluate in many models . unfortunately , it also obscures the physics which determines . for this reason it is hard to infer , from eq . alone , those classes of models in which is always large or small . is dynamically allowed . see , for example , refs . . ] our strategy is quite different . we choose ` ' to lie around the time when we require the statistical properties of . the role of the formula , eq . , is then to encode only the gauge transformation between the and . in below , we show how the appropriate gauge transformation is computed using the formula . in the present section we restrict our attention to determining a formula for under the assumption that the distribution of field values on ` ' is known . in , we will supply the required prescription to evolve the distribution of field values between horizon exit and ` ' . although the are independent random variables at horizon exit , correlations can be induced by subsequent evolution . one must therefore allow for off - diagonal terms in the two - point function . remembering that we are working with a collection of spacetime volumes in real space , smoothed on some characteristic scale , we write does not vary in space , but it may be a function of the scale which characterizes our ensemble of spacetime volumes . in all but the simplest models it will vary in time . it is also necessary to account for intrinsic non - linearities among the , which are small at horizon crossing but may grow . we define likewise , should be regarded as a function of time and scale . the permutation symmetries of an expectation value such as guarantee that , for example , . when written explicitly , we place the indices of symbols such as in numerical order . neglecting a small  intrinsic four - point correlation , it follows that now we specialize to a two - field model , parametrized by fields and . using eqs . , and , it follows that the two - point function of satisfies the three - point function can be written where we have identified two separate contributions , labelled ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' . the ` 1 ' term includes all contributions involving intrinsic non - linearities , those which arise from non - gaussian correlations among the field fluctuations , the ` 2 ' term encodes non - linearities arising directly from the gauge transformation to after use of eq . , can be used to extract the non - linearity parameter . this decomposes likewise into two contributions , which we shall discuss in more detail in . to compute in concrete models , we require expressions for the derivatives and . for generic initial and final times , these are difficult to obtain . lyth & rodrguez used direct integration , which is effective for quadratic potentials and constant slow - roll parameters . vernizzi & wands obtained expressions in a two - field model with an arbitrary sum - separable potential by introducing gaussian normal coordinates on the space of trajectories . their approach was generalized to many fields by battefeld & easther . product - separable potentials can be accommodated using the same technique . an alternative technique has been proposed by yokoyama . a considerable simplification occurs in the present case , because we only require the derivative evaluated between flat and comoving hypersurfaces which coincide in the unperturbed universe . for any species , and to leading order in the slow - roll approximation , the number of e - folds between the flat hypersurface ` ' and a comoving hypersurface ` ' satisfies where and are the field values evaluated on ` ' and ` , ' respectively . under an infinitesimal shift of , we deduce that obeys note that this applies for an arbitrary , which need not factorize into a sum or product of potentials for the individual species . in principle a contribution from variation of the integrand is present , which spoils a nave attempt to generalize the method of refs . to an arbitrary potential . this contribution vanishes in virtue of our supposition that ` ' and ` ' are infinitesimally separated . to compute it is helpful to introduce a quantity , which in the sum - separable case coincides with the conserved quantity of vernizzi & wands . for our specific choice of a two - field model , this takes the form where the integrals are evaluated on a single spatial hypersurface . in an -field model , one would obtain conserved quantities which label the isocurvature fields . the construction of these quantities is discussed in refs . . for sum - separable potentials one can show using the equations of motion that is conserved under time evolution to leading order in slow - roll . it is not conserved for general potentials , but the variation can be neglected for infinitesimally separated hypersurfaces . under a change of trajectory , varies according to the rules and the comoving hypersurface ` ' is defined by we are assuming that the slow - roll approximation applies , so that the kinetic energy may be neglected in comparison with the potential . therefore on ` ' we have combining eqs . , and we obtain expressions for , namely where we have defined eqs . can alternatively be derived without use of by comparing eq . with the formulas of ref . , which were derived using conventional perturbation theory . applying , we obtain to proceed , we require the second derivatives of . these can be obtained directly from , after use of eqs . . we find ^\\star \\cos^2 \\theta + 2 \\left ( {v {,1 } } \\right)^{\\star 2 } \\cos^2 \\theta \\\\ \\mbox { } \\times \\left ^c . \\ ] ] an analogous expression for can be obtained after the simultaneous exchange . the mixed derivative satisfies ^c \\\\ \\mbox { } + \\cos^2 \\theta \\left ( }{v {,1 } } - }{v {,1}^2 } \\right)^c . \\ ] ] now that the calculation is complete , we can drop the superscripts ` ' and ` , ' since any background quantity is the same on either hypersurface . once this is done it can be verified that ( despite appearances ) eq . is invariant under the exchange . in this section we return to the problem of evolution between horizon exit and the time of observation , and supply the prescription which connects the distribution of field values at these two times . we begin by discussing the single - field system , which lacks the technical complexity of the two - field case , yet still exhibits certain interesting features which recur there . among these features are the subtle difference between motion of the statistical mean and the background field value , and the hierarchy of moment evolution equations . moreover , the structure of the moment mixing equations is similar to that which obtains in the two - field case . for this reason , the one - field scenario provides an instructive example of the techniques we wish to employ . recall that we work in real space with a collection of comparably sized spacetime volumes , each with a slightly different expansion history , and the scatter in these histories determines the microwave background anisotropy on a given angular scale . within each volume the smoothed background field takes a uniform value described by a density function , where in this section we are dropping the superscript ` ' denoting evaluation of spatially flat hypersurfaces . our ultimate goal is to calculate the reduced bispectrum , , which describes the third moment of . in the language of probability this is the skewness , which we denote . a gaussian distribution has skewness zero , and inflation usually predicts that the skew is small . for this reason , rather than seek a distribution with non - zero third moment , as proposed in ref . , we will introduce higher moments as perturbative corrections to the gaussian . such a procedure is known as a cumulant expansion . the construction of cumulant expansions is a classical problem in probability theory . we seek a distribution with centroid , variance , and skew , with all higher moments determined by and alone . a distribution with suitable properties is , \\ ] ] where \\ ] ] is a pure gaussian and denotes the hermite polynomial , for which there are multiple normalization conventions . we choose to normalize so that which implies that the leading term of is . this is sometimes called the `` probabilist s convention . '' we define expectation values by the usual rule , the probability density function in eq . has the properties , and do not depend on the approximation that is small . however , for large the density function may become negative for some values of . it then ceases to be a probability density in the strict sense . this does not present a problem in practice , since we are interested in distributions which are approximately gaussian , and for which will typically be small . moreover , our principal use of eq . is as a formal tool to extract evolution equations for each moment . for this reason we will not worry whether defines an honest probability density function in the strict mathematical sense . ] the moments , , and may be time - dependent , so evolution of the probability density in time can be accommodated by finding evolution equations for these quantities . the density function given in eq . is well - known and has been applied in many situations . it is a solution to the problem of approximating a nearly - gaussian distribution whose moments are known .  is in fact the first two terms of the gram charlier ` a ' series , also sometimes called the hermite series . in recent years it has found multiple applications to cosmology , of which our method is closest to that of taylor & watts . other applications are discussed in refs . . for a review of the ` a ' series and related nearly - gaussian probability distributions from an astrophysical perspective , see . in this paper , we will refer to eq . and its natural generalization to higher moments as the `` moment expansion . '' in the slow - roll approximation , the field in each spacetime volume obeys a simple equation of motion where records the number of e - foldings of expansion . we refer to as the velocity field . expanding about the instantaneous centroid gives where the value of evolves with time , so each expansion coefficient is time - dependent . hence , we do not assume that the velocity field is globally well - described by a quadratic taylor expansion , but merely that it is well - described as such in the neighborhood of the instantaneous centroid . we expand the velocity field to second order , although in principle this expansion could be carried to arbitrary order . it remains to specify how the probability density evolves in time . conservation of probability leads to the transport equation eq . can also be understood as the limit of a chapman kolmogorov process as the size of each hop goes to zero . it is well known for example , from the study of starobinsky s diffusion equation which forms the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation that the choice of time variable in this equation is significant , with different choices corresponding to the selection of a temporal gauge . we have chosen to use the e - folding time , , which means that we are evolving the distribution on hypersurfaces of uniform expansion . these are the spatially flat hypersurfaces whose field perturbations enter the formulas described in . in principle , eq . can be solved directly . in practice it is simpler to extract equations for the moments of , giving evolution equations for , and . to achieve this , one need only resolve eq . into a hermite series of the form the hermite polynomials are linearly independent , and application of the orthogonality condition shows that the must all vanish . this leads to a hierarchy of equations , which we refer to as the moment hierarchy . at the top of the hierarchy , the equation is empty and expresses conservation of probability . the first non - trivial equation requires and yields an evolution equation for the centroid , the first term on the right - hand side drives the centroid along the velocity field , as one would anticipate based on the background equation of motion , eq . . however , the second term shows that the centroid is also influenced as the wings of the probability distribution probe the nearby velocity field . this influence is not captured by the background equation of motion . if we are in a situation with , then the wings of the density function will be moving faster than the center . hence , the velocity of the centroid will be larger than one might expect by restricting attention to . accordingly , the mean fluctuation value is not following a solution to the background equations of motion . evolution equations for the variance and skew are obtained after enforcing , yielding in both equations , the first term on the right - hand sides describes how and scale as the density function expands or contracts in response to the velocity field . these terms force and to scale in proportion to the velocity field . specifically , if we temporarily drop the second terms in each equation above , one finds that and . this precisely matches our expectation for the scaling of these quantities . hence , these terms account for the jacobians associated with infinitesimal transformations induced by the flow . for applications to inflationary non - gaussianity , the second terms in and are more relevant . these terms describe how each moment is sourced by higher moments and the interaction of the density function with the velocity field . in the example above , if we are in a situation where , the tails of the density function are moving faster than the core . this means that one tail is shrinking and the other is extending , skewing the probability density . the opposite occurs when . these effects are measured by the second term in . hence , by expanding our pdf to the third moment , and our velocity field to quadratic order , we are able to construct a set of evolution equations which include the leading - order source terms for each moment . there is little conceptually new as we move from one field to two . the new features are mostly technical in nature . our primary challenge is a generalization of the moment expansion to two fields , allowing for the possibility of correlation between the fields . with this done , we can write down evolution equations whose structure is very similar to those found in the single - field case . the two - field system is described by a two - dimensional velocity field , defined by where again we are using the number of e - folds as the time variable . the index takes values in . while we think it is likely that our equations generalize to any number of fields , we have only explicitly constructed them for a two - field system . as will become clear below , certain steps in this construction apply only for two fields , and hence we make no claims at present concerning examples with three or more fields . the two - dimensional transport equation is = 0 .\\ ] ] here and in the following we have returned to our convention that repeated species indices are summed . as in the single - field case , we construct a probability distribution which is nearly gaussian , but has a small non - zero skewness . that gives where is a pure gaussian distribution , defined by .\\ ] ] in this equation , defines the center of the distribution and describes the covariance between the fields . we adopt a conventional parametrization in terms of variances and a correlation coefficient , the matrix defines two - point correlations of the fields , all skewnesses are encoded in . before defining this explicitly , it is helpful to pause and notice a complication inherent in eqs . which was not present in the single - field case . to extract a hierarchy of moment evolution equations from the transport equation , eq . , we made the expansion given in and argued that orthogonality of the hermite polynomials implied the hierarchy . however , hermite polynomials of the form $ ] are not orthogonal under the gaussian measure of eq . . following an expansion analogous to eq . the moment hierarchy would comprise linear combinations of the coefficients . the problem is essentially an algebraic question of gram schmidt orthogonalization . to avoid this problem it is convenient to diagonalize the covariance matrix , introducing new variables and for which eq . factorizes into the product of two measures under which the polynomials and are separately orthogonal . the necessary redefinitions are \\ ] ] and .\\ ] ] a simple expression for can be given in terms of and , we now define the non - gaussian factor , which encodes the skewnesses , to be in these variables we find , but . in addition , we have in order for eq . to be useful , it is necessary to express the skewnesses associated with the physical variables in terms of and . by definition , these satisfy after substituting for the definition of these quantities inside the expectation values in eq . we arrive at the relations the moments , and are time - dependent , but for clarity we will usually suppress this in our notation . next we must extract the moment hierarchy , which governs evolution of , , and . we expand the velocity field in a neighborhood of the instantaneous centroid according to where we have defined as in the single - field case , these coefficients are functions of time and vary with the motion of the centroid . the expansion can be pursued to higher order if desired . our construction of and implies that the two - field transport equation can be arranged as a double gauss hermite expansion , = p g \\sum {m , n \\ge 0 } c {mn } h m(x ) h n(y ) = 0 .\\ ] ] because the hermite polynomials are orthogonal in the measure defined by , we deduce the moment hierarchy we define the rank \" of each coefficient by . we terminated the velocity field expansion at quadratic order , and our probability distribution included only the first three moments . it follows that only with rank five or less are nonzero . if we followed the velocity field to higher order , or included higher terms in the moment expansion , we would obtain non - trivial higher - rank coefficients . inclusion of additional coefficients requires no qualitative modification of our analysis and can be incorporated in the scheme we describe below . a useful feature of the expansion in eq . is that the rank- coefficients give evolution equations for the order- moments . written explicitly in components , the expressions that result from are quite cumbersome . however , when written as field - space covariant expressions they can be expressed in a surprisingly compact form . : : the rank-0 coefficient is identically zero . this expresses the fact that the total probability is conserved as the distribution evolves . : : the rank-1 coefficients and give evolution equations for the centroid . these equations can be written in the form we remind the reader that here and below , terms like , and represent the velocity field and its derivatives evaluated at the centroid . the first term in expresses the non - anomalous motion of the centroid , which coincides with the background velocity field of eq . . the second term describes how the wings of the probability distribution sample the velocity field at nearby points . narrow probability distributions have small components of and hence are only sensitive to the local value of . broad probability distributions have large components of and are therefore more sensitive to the velocity field far from the centroid . : : the rank-2 coefficients , and give evolution equations for the variances and the correlation . these can conveniently be packaged as evolution equations for the matrix this equation describes the stretching and rotation of as it is transported by the velocity field . it includes a sensitivity to the wings of the probability distribution , in a manner analogous to the similar term appearing in . hence the skew acts as a source for the correlation matrix . : : the rank-3 coefficients , , and describe evolution of the moments . these are the first term describes how the moments flow into each other as the velocity field rotates and shears the coordinate frame relative to the coordinate frame . the second term describes sourcing of non - gaussianity from inhomogeneities in the velocity field and the overall spread of the probability distribution . some higher - rank coefficients in our case , those of ranks four and five are also nonzero , but do not give any new evolution equations . these coefficients measure the error \" introduced by truncating the moment expansion . if we had included higher cumulants , these higher - rank coefficients would have given evolution equations for the higher moments of the probability distribution . in general , all moments of the density function will mix so it is always necessary to terminate our expansion at a predetermined order both in cumulants and powers of the field fluctuation . the order we have chosen is sufficient to generate evolution equations containing both the leading - order behavior of the moments namely , the first terms in eqs . , and and the leading corrections , given by the latter terms in these equations . at this point we put our new method into practice . we study two models for which the non - gaussian signal is already known , using the standard formula . for each case we employ our method and compare it with results obtained using . to ensure a fair comparison , we solve numerically in both cases . our new method employs the slow - roll approximation , as described above . therefore , when using the approach we produce results both with and without slow - roll simplifications . first consider double quadratic inflation , which was studied by rigopoulos , shellard & van tent and later by vernizzi & wands . the potential is we use the initial conditions chosen in ref . , where , and the fiducial trajectory has coordinates and . we plot the evolution of in fig . , which also shows the prediction of the standard formula ( with and without employing slow roll simplifications ) . we implement the algorithm using a finite difference method to calculate the derivatives of . a similar technique was used in ref . this model yields a very modest non - gaussian signal , below unity even at its peak . if inflation ends away from the spike then is practically negligible . shows that the method of moment transport allows us to separate contributions to from the intrinsic non - gaussianity of the field fluctuations , and non - linearities of the gauge transformation to . as explained in , we denote the former and the latter , and plot them separately in fig . . inspection of this figure clearly shows that is determined by a cancellation between two much larger components . its final shape and magnitude are exquisitely sensitive to their relative phase . initially , the magnitudes of and grow , but their sum remains small . the peak in fig . arises from the peak of , which is incompletely cancelled by . it is remarkable that initially evolves in exact opposition to the gauge transformation , to which it is not obviously connected . in the double quadratic model , is always small . however , it has recently been shown by byrnes that a large non - gaussian signal can be generated even when slow - roll is a good approximation . the conditions for this to occur are incompletely understood , but apparently require a specific choice of potential and strong tuning of initial conditions . in figs . we show the evolution of in a model with the potential which corresponds to example a of ref . * 5 ) when we choose and initial conditions , . it is clear that the agreement is exact . in this model , is overwhelmingly dominated by the contribution from the second - order gauge transformation , , as shown in fig . . this conclusion applies equally to the other large- examples discussed in refs . , although we make no claim that this is a general phenomenon . in conclusion , figs . and show excellent agreement between our new method and the outcome of the numerical formula . these figures also compare the moment transport method and without the slow - roll approximation . we conclude that the slow - roll estimate remains broadly accurate throughout the entire evolution . non - linearities are now routinely extracted from all - sky observations of the microwave background anisotropy . our purpose in this paper has been to propose a new technique with which to predict the observable signal . present data already give interesting constraints on the skewness parameter , and over the next several years we expect that the planck survey satellite will make these constraints very stringent . it is even possible that higher - order moments , such as the kurtosis parameter will become better constrained . to meet the need of the observational community for comparison with theory , reliable estimates of these non - linear quantities will be necessary for various models of early - universe physics . a survey of the literature suggests that the ` conventional ' method , originally introduced by lyth & rodrguez , remains the method of choice for analytical study of non - gaussianity . in comparison , our proposed moment transport method exhibits several clear differences . first , the conventional method functions best when we base the expansion on a flat hypersurface immediately after horizon exit . in our method , we make the opposite choice and move the flat hypersurface as close as possible to the time of observation . after this , the role of the formula is to provide no more than the non - linear gauge transformation between field fluctuations and the curvature perturbation . we substitute the method of moment transport to evolve the distribution of field fluctuations between horizon exit and observation . second , in integrating the transport equation one uses an expansion of the velocity field such as the one given in eqs . . this expansion is refreshed at each step of integration , so the result is related to conventional perturbative calculations in a very similar way to renormalization - group improved perturbation theory . in this interpretation , derivatives of play the role of couplings . at a given order , , in the moment hierarchy , the equations for lower - order moments function as renormalization group equations for the couplings at level- , resumming potentially large terms before they spoil perturbation theory . this property is shared with any formalism such as which is non - perturbative in time evolution , but may be an advantage in comparison with perturbative methods . we also note that although is non - perturbative as a point of principle , practical implementations are frequently perturbative . for example , the method of vernizzi & wands and battefeld & easther depends on the existence of quantities which are conserved only to leading order in , and can lose accuracy after e - foldings . numerical calculations confirm that our method gives results in excellent agreement with existing techniques . as a by - product of our analysis , we note that the large non - gaussianities which have recently been observed in sum- and product - separable potentials are dominated by non - linearities from the second - order part of the gauge transformation from to . the contribution from intrinsic non - linearities of the field fluctuations , measured by the skewnesses , is negligible . in such cases one can obtain a useful formula for by approximating the field distribution as an exact gaussian . the non - gaussianity produced in such cases arises from a distortion of comoving hypersurfaces with respect to adjacent spatially flat hypersurfaces . our new method joins many well - established techniques for estimating non - gaussian properties of the curvature perturbation . in our experience , these techniques give comparable estimates of , but they do not exactly agree . each method invokes different assumptions , such as the neglect of gradients or the degree to which time dependence can be accommodated . the mutual scatter between different methods can be attributed to the theory error inherent in any estimate of . the comparison presented in shows that while all of these methods slightly disagree , the moment transport method gives good agreement with other established methods . dm is supported by the cambridge centre for theoretical cosmology ( ctc ) . ds is funded by stfc . dw acknowledges support from the ctc . we would like to thank chris byrnes , jim lidsey and karim malik for helpful conversations . 10 t. falk , r. rangarajan , and m. srednicki , the angular dependence of the three -

{"article": "the lep experiments at the resonance of -boson have tested the standard model ( sm ) at quantum level , measuring the -decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousands . the good agreement of the lep data with the sm predictions have severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the -pole . taking these achievements into account one can imagine that the physics of -boson will again play the central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation factory comes true with the generated events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the lep . this factory can be realized in the gigaz option of the international linear collider ( ilc) . the ilc is a proposed electron - positron collider with tunable energy ranging from to and polarized beams in its first phase , and the gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line . given the high luminosity , , and the cross section at the resonance of boson , , about events can be generated in an operational year of of gigaz , which implies that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of -decay can be improved from at the lep to at the gigaz . in light of this , the -boson properties , especially its exotic or rare decays which are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics , should be investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential in probing new physics . among the rare -decays , the flavor changing ( fc ) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics , and it was found that , although these processes are severely suppressed in the sm , their branching ratios in new physics models can be greatly enhanced to for lepton flavor violation decays and for quark flavor violation decays . besides the fc processes , the -decay into light higgs boson(s ) is another type of rare process that was widely studied , e.g. the decay  with the particle denoting a light higgs boson was studied in , the decay was studied in the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm) , and the decay was studied in a model independent way , in 2hdm and also in mssm . these studies indicate that , in contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decays in the sm , the rates of these decays can be as large as in new physics models , which lie within the expected sensitivity of the gigaz . in this work , we extend the previous studies of these decays to some new models and investigate these decays altogether . we are motivated by some recent studies on the singlet extension of the mssm , such as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , where a light cp - odd higgs boson with singlet - dominant component may naturally arise from the spontaneous breaking of some approximate global symmetry like or peccei - quuin symmetry . these non - minimal supersymmetric models can not only avoid the -problem , but also alleviate the little hierarchy by having such a light higgs boson . we are also motivated by that , with the latest experiments , the properties of the light higgs boson are more stringently constrained than before . so it is worth updating the previous studies . so far there is no model - independent lower bound on the lightest higgs boson mass . in the sm , it must be heavier than gev , obtained from the null observation of the higgs boson at lep experiments . however , due to the more complex structure of the higgs sector in the extensions of the sm , this lower bound can be significantly relaxed according to recent studies , e.g. , for the cp - odd higgs boson we have gev in the nmssm , gev in the nmssm , and gev in the lepton - specific 2hdm ( l2hdm ) . with such a light cp - odd higgs boson , the z - decay into one or more is open up . noting that the decay is forbidden due to bose symmetry , we in this work study the rare -decays  , and in a comparative way for four models , namely the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm . in our study , we examine carefully the constraints on the light from many latest experimental results . this work is organized as follows . in sec . ii we briefly describe the four new physics models . in sec . iii we present the calculations of the rare -decays . in sec . iv we list the constraints on the four new physics models . in sec . v we show the numerical results for the branching ratios of the rare -decays in various models . finally , the conclusion is given in sec . as the most economical way , the sm utilizes one higgs doublet to break the electroweak symmetry . as a result , the sm predicts only one physical higgs boson with its properties totally determined by two free parameters . in new physics models , the higgs sector is usually extended by adding higgs doublets and/or singlets , and consequently , more physical higgs bosons are predicted along with more free parameters involved in . the general 2hdm contains two doublet higgs fields and , and with the assumption of cp - conserving , its scalar potential can be parameterized as : ,\\ ] ] where  are free dimensionless parameters , and  are the parameters with mass dimension . after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the spectrum of this higgs sector includes three massless goldstone modes , which become the longitudinal modes of and bosons , and five massive physical states : two cp - even higgs bosons and , one neutral cp - odd higgs particle and a pair of charged higgs bosons . noting the constraint with and denoting the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of and respectively , we choose as the input parameters with , and being the mixing angle that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the cp - even higgs fields . the difference between the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm comes from the yukawa coupling of the higgs bosons to quark / lepton . in the type - ii 2hdm , one higgs doublet generates the masses of up - type quarks and the other doublet generates the masses of down - type quarks and charged leptons ; while in the l2hdm one higgs doublet couples only to leptons and the other doublet couples only to quarks . so the yukawa interactions of to fermions in these two models are given by with denoting generation index . obviously , in the type - ii 2hdm the coupling and the coupling can be simultaneously enhanced by , while in the l2hdm only the coupling is enhanced by . the structures of the nmssm and the nmssm are described by their superpotentials and corresponding soft - breaking terms , which are given by where is the superpotential of the mssm without the term , and are higgs doublet and singlet superfields with and being their scalar component respectively , , , , , and are soft breaking parameters , and and are coefficients of the higgs self interactions . with the superpotentials and the soft - breaking terms , one can get the higgs potentials of the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . like the 2hdm , the higgs bosons with same cp property will mix and the mass eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing the corresponding mass matrices : where the fields on the right hands of the equations are component fields of , and defined by and are respectively the cp - even and cp - odd neutral higgs bosons , and are goldstone bosons eaten by and , and is the charged higgs boson . so both the nmssm and nmssm predict three cp - even higgs bosons , two cp - odd higgs bosons and one pair of charged higgs bosons . in general , the lighter cp - odd higgs in these model is the mixture of the singlet field and the doublet field combination , , i.e. and its couplings to down - type quarks are then proportional to . so for singlet dominated , is small and the couplings are suppressed . as a comparison , the interactions of with the squarks are given by i.e. the interaction does not vanish when approaches zero . just like the 2hdm where we use the vevs of the higgs fields as fundamental parameters , we choose , , , , and as input parameters for the nmssm and , , , , and as input parameters for the nmssm . about the nmssm and the nmssm , three points should be noted . the first is for the two models , there is no explicit term , and the effective parameter  is generated when the scalar component of develops a vev . the second is , the nmssm is actually same as the nmssm with , because the tadpole terms and its soft breaking term in the nmssm do not induce any interactions , except for the tree - level higgs boson masses and the minimization conditions . and the last is despite of the similarities , the nmssm has its own peculiarity , which comes from its neutralino sector . in the basis , its neutralino mass matrix is given by where and are and gaugino masses respectively , , , and . after diagonalizing this matrix one can get the mass eigenstate of the lightest neutralino with mass taking the following form this expression implies that must be lighter than about gev for ( from lower bound on chargnio mass ) and ( perturbativity bound ) . like the other supersymmetric models , as the lightest sparticle acts as the dark matter in the universe , but due to its singlino - dominated nature , it is difficult to annihilate sufficiently to get the correct density in the current universe . so the relic density of plays a crucial way in selecting the model parameters . for example , as shown in , for , there is no way to get the correct relic density , and for the other cases , mainly annihilates by exchanging boson for , or by exchanging a light cp - odd higgs boson with mass satisfying the relation for . for the annihilation , and are required to be less than 10 and respectively because through eq. a large or will suppress to make the annihilation more difficult . the properties of the lightest cp - odd higgs boson , such as its mass and couplings , are also limited tightly since plays an important role in annihilation . the phenomenology of the nmssm is also rather special , and this was discussed in detail in . in the type - ii 2hdm , l2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , the rare -decays  , and may proceed by the feynman diagrams shown in fig. , fig. and fig. respectively . for these diagrams , the intermediate state represents all possible cp - even higgs bosons in the corresponding model , i.e. and in type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm and , and in nmssm and nmssm . in order to take into account the possible resonance effects of in fig.(c ) for and fig. ( a ) for , we have calculated all the decay modes of and properly included the width effect in its propagator . as to the decay , two points should be noted . one is , unlike the decays and , this process proceeds only through loops mediated by quarks / leptons in the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm , and additionally by sparticles in the nmssm and nmssm . so in most cases its rate should be much smaller than the other two . the other is due to cp - invariance , loops mediated by squarks / sleptons give no contribution to the decay . in actual calculation , this is reflected by the fact that the coupling coefficient of differs from that of by a minus sign ( see eq. ) , and as a result , the squark - mediated contributions to are completely canceled out . with regard to the rare decay , we have more explanations . in the lowest order , this decay proceeds by the diagram shown in fig. ( a ) , and hence one may think that , as a rough estimate , it is enough to only consider the contributions from fig.(a ) . however , we note that in some cases of the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm , due to the cancelation of the contributions from different in fig. ( a ) and also due to the potentially largeness of couplings ( i.e. larger than the electroweak scale ) , the radiative correction from the higgs - mediated loops may dominate over the tree level contribution even when the tree level prediction of the rate , , exceeds . on the other hand , we find the contribution from quark / lepton - mediated loops can be safely neglected if in the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm . in the nmssm and the nmssm , besides the corrections from the higgs- and quark / lepton - mediated loops , loops involving sparticles such as squarks , charginos and neutralinos can also contribute to the decay . we numerically checked that the contributions from squarks and charginos can be safely neglected if . we also calculated part of potentially large neutralino correction ( note that there are totally about diagrams for such correction ! ) and found they can be neglected too . since considering all the radiative corrections will make our numerical calculation rather slow , we only include the most important correction , namely that from higgs - mediated loops , in presenting our results for the four models . one can intuitively understand the relative smallness of the sparticle contribution to as follows . first consider the squark contribution which is induced by the interaction ( denotes the squark in chirality state ) and the interaction through box diagrams . because the interaction conserves the chirality of the squarks while the interaction violates the chirality , to get non - zero contribution to from the squark loops , at least four chiral flippings are needed , with three of them provided by interaction and the rest provided by the left - right squark mixing . this means that , if one calculates the amplitude in the chirality basis with the mass insertion method , the amplitude is suppressed by the mixing factor with being the off diagonal element in squark mass matrix . next consider the chargino / neutralino contributions . since for a light , its doublet component , parameterized by in eq. , is usually small , the couplings of with the sparticles will never be tremendously large . so the chargino / neutralino contributions are not important too . in our calculation of the decays , we work in the mass eigenstates of sparticles instead of in the chirality basis . for the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , we consider the following constraints : * theoretical constraints on from perturbativity , unitarity and requirements that the scalar potential is finit at large field values and contains no flat directions , which imply that * the constraints from the lep search for neutral higgs bosons . we compute the signals from the higgs - strahlung production  with and from the associated production with , and compare them with the corresponding lep data which have been inputted into our code . we also consider the constraints from by looking for a peak of recoil mass distribution of -boson and the constraint of mev when . + these constraints limit the quantities such as \\times br ( h i \\to b ) $ ] on the plane with the the subscript denoting the coupling coefficient of the interaction . they also impose a model - dependent lower bound on , e.g. , for the type - ii 2hdm ( from our scan results ) , for the l2hdm , and for the nmssm . these bounds are significantly lower than that of the sm , i.e. , partially because in new physics models , unconventional decay modes of such as are open up . as to the nmssm , another specific reason for allowing a significantly lighter cp - even higgs boson is that the boson may be singlet - dominated in this model . + with regard to the lightest cp - odd higgs boson , we checked that there is no lower bound on its mass so long as the interaction is weak or is sufficiently heavy . * the constraints from the lep search for a light higgs boson via the yukawa process with and denoting a scalar . these constraints can limit the coupling versus in new physics models . * the constraints from the cleo - iii limit on and the latest babar limits on . these constraints will put very tight constraints on the coupling for . in our analysis , we use the results of fig.8 in the second paper of to excluded the unfavored points . * the constraints from couplings . since the higgs sector can give sizable higher order corrections to couplings , we calculate them to one loop level and require the corrected couplings to lie within the range of their fitted value . the sm predictions for the couplings at -pole are given by and , and the fitted values are given by and , respectively . we adopt the formula in to the 2hdm in our calculation . * the constraints from leptonic decay . we require the new physics correction to the branching ratio to be in the range of . we use the formula in in our calculation . + about the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , two points should be noted . one is all higgs bosons are involved in the constraints by entering the self energy of lepton , the vertex correction or the vertex correction , and also the box diagrams for . since the yukawa couplings of the higgs bosons to lepton get enhanced by and so do the corrections , must be upper bounded for given spectrum of the higgs sector . generally speaking , the lighter is , the more tightly is limited . the other point is in the type - ii 2hdm , , b - physics observables as well as decays discussed above can constraint the model in a tighter way than the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) since the yukawa couplings of lepton and quark are simultaneously enhanced by . but for the l2hdm , because only the yukawa couplings of lepton get enhanced ( see eq. ) , the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are more important in limiting . * indirect constraints from the precision electroweak observables such as , and , or their combinations . we require to be compatible with the lep / sld data at confidence level . we also require new physics prediction of is within the range of its experimental value . the latest results for are ( measured value ) and ( sm prediction ) for gev . in our code , we adopt the formula for these observables presented in to the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm respectively . + in calculating , and , we note that these observables get dominant contributions from the self energies of the gauge bosons , and . since there is no coupling or coupling , must be associated with the other higgs bosons to contribute to the self energies . so by the uv convergence of these quantities , one can infer that , for the case of a light and , these quantities depend on the spectrum of the higgs sector in a way like at leading order , which implies that a light can still survive the constraints from the precision electroweak observables given the splitting between and is moderate . * the constraints from b physics observables such as the branching ratios for , and , and the mass differences and . we require their theoretical predications to agree with the corresponding experimental values at level . + in the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , only the charged higgs boson contributes to these observables by loops , so one can expect that versus is to be limited . combined analysis of the limits in the type - ii 2hdm has been done by the ckmfitter group , and the lower bound of as a function of was given in fig.11 of . this analysis indicates that must be heavier than at c.l . regardless the value of . in this work , we use the results of fig.11 in to exclude the unfavored points . as for the l2hdm , b physics actually can not put any constraints because in this model the couplings of the charged higgs boson to quarks are proportional to and in the case of large which we are interested in , they are suppressed . in our analysis of the l2hdm , we impose the lep bound on , i.e. . * the constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment . now both the theoretical prediction and the experimental measured value of have reached a remarkable precision , but a significant deviation still exists : . in the 2hdm , gets additional contributions from the one - loop diagrams induced by the higgs bosons and also from the two - loop barr - zee diagrams mediated by and . if the higgs bosons are much heavier than lepton mass , the contributions from the barr - zee diagrams are more important , and to efficiently alleviate the discrepancy of , one needs a light along with its enhanced couplings to lepton and also to heavy fermions such as bottom quark and lepton to push up the effects of the barr - zee diagram . the cp - even higgs bosons are usually preferred to be heavy since their contributions to are negative . + in the type - ii 2hdm , because is tightly constrained by the process at the lep and the decay , the barr - zee diagram contribution is insufficient to enhance to range around its measured value . so in our analysis , we require the type - ii 2hdm to explain at level . while for the l2hdm , is less constrained compared with the type - ii 2hdm , and the barr - zee diagram involving the -loop is capable to push up greatly the theoretical prediction of . therefore , we require the l2hdm to explain the discrepancy at level . + unlike the other constraints discussed above , the constraint will put a two - sided bound on since on the one hand , it needs a large to enhance the barr - zee contribution , but on the other hand , too large will result in an unacceptable large . * since this paper concentrates on a light , the decay is open up with a possible large decay width . we require the width of any higgs boson to be smaller than its mass to avoid a too fat higgs boson . we checked that for the scenario characterized by , the coefficient of interaction is usually larger than the electroweak scale , and consequently a large decay width is resulted . for the nmssm and nmssm , the above constraints become more complicated because in these models , not only more higgs bosons are involved in , but also sparticles enter the constraints . so it is not easy to understand some of the constraints intuitively . take the process as an example . in the supersymmetric models , besides the charged higgs contribution , chargino loops , gluino loops as well as neutralino loops also contribute to the process , and depending on the susy parameters , any of these contributions may become dominated over or be canceled by other contributions . as a result , although the charged higgs affects the process in the same way as that in the type - ii 2hdm , charged higgs as light as is still allowed even for . since among the constraints , is rather peculiar in that it needs new physics to explain the discrepancy between and , we discuss more about its dependence on susy parameters . in the nmssm and the nmssm , receives contributions from higgs loops and neutralino / chargino loops . for the higgs contribution , it is quite similar to that of the type - ii 2hdm except that more higgs bosons are involved in . for the neutralino / chargino contribution , in the light bino limit ( i.e. ) , it can be approximated by for with being smuon mass . so combining the two contributions together , one can learn that a light along with large and/or light smuon with moderate are favored to dilute the discrepancy . because more parameters are involved in the constraints on the supersymmetric models , we consider following additional constraints to further limit their parameters : * direct bounds on sparticle masses from the lep1 , the lep2 and the tevatron experiments . * the lep1 bound on invisible z decay ; the lep2 bound on neutralino production and . * dark matter constraints from the wmap relic density 0.0975 0.1213 . note that among the above constraints , the constraint ( 2 ) on higgs sector and the constraint ( c ) on neutralino sector are very important . this is because in the supersymmetric models , the sm - like higgs is upper bounded by about at tree level and by about at loop level , and that the relic density restricts the lsp annihilation cross section in a certain narrow range . in our analysis of the nmssm , we calculate the constraints ( 3 ) and ( 5 - 7 ) by ourselves and utilize the code nmssmtools to implement the rest constraints . we also extend nmssmtools to the nmssm to implement the constraints . for the extension , the most difficult thing we faced is how to adapt the code micromegas to the nmssm case . we solve this problem by noting the following facts : * as we mentioned before , the nmssm is actually same as the nmssm with the trilinear singlet term setting to zero . so we can utilize the model file of the nmssm as the input of the micromegas and set . * since in the nmssm , the lsp is too light to annihilate into higgs pairs , there is no need to reconstruct the effective higgs potential to calculate precisely the annihilation channel with denoting any of higgs bosons . we thank the authors of the nmssmtools for helpful discussion on this issue when we finish such extension . with the above constraints , we perform four independent random scans over the parameter space of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . we vary the parameters in following ranges : for the type - ii 2hdm , for the l2hdm , for the nmssm , and for the nmssm . in performing the scans , we note that for the nmssm and the nmssm , some constraints also rely on the gaugino masses and the soft breaking parameters in the squark sector and the slepton sector . since these parameters affect little on the properties of , we fix them to reduce the number of free parameters in our scan . for the squark sector , we adopt the scenario which assumes that the soft mass parameters for the third generation squarks are degenerate : 800 gev , and that the trilinear couplings of the third generation squarks are also degenerate , with . for the slepton sector , we assume all the soft - breaking masses and trilinear parameters to be 100 gev . this setting is necessary for the nmssm since this model is difficult to explain the muon anomalous moment at level for heavy sleptons . finally , we assume the grand unification relation for the gaugino masses with being fine structure constants of the different gauge group . with large number of random points in the scans , we finally get about , , and samples for the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively which survive the constraints and satisfy . analyzing the properties of the indicates that for most of the surviving points in the nmssm and the nmssm , its dominant component is the singlet field ( numerically speaking , ) so that its couplings to the sm fermions are suppressed . our analysis also indicates that the main decay products of are for the l2hdm , ( dominant ) and ( subdominant ) for the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , and in some rare cases , neutralino pairs in the nmssm . in fig. , we project the surviving samples on the plane . this figure shows that the allowed range of is from to in the type - ii 2hdm , and from to in the l2hdm . just as we introduced before , the lower bounds of come from the fact that we require the models to explain the muon anomalous moment , while the upper bound is due to we have imposed the constraint from the lep process , which have limited the upper reach of the coupling for light (for the dependence of coupling on , see sec . this figure also indicates that for the nmssm and the nmssm , is upper bounded by . for the nmssm , this is because large can suppress the dark matter mass to make its annihilation difficult ( see and also sec . ii ) , but for the nmssm , this is because we choose a light slepton mass so that large can enhance too significantly to be experimentally unacceptable . we checked that for the slepton mass as heavy as , is still allowed for the nmssm . in fig. and fig. , we show the branching ratios of and respectively . fig. indicates , among the four models , the type - ii 2hdm predicts the largest ratio for with its value varying from to . the underlying reason is in the type - ii 2hdm , the coupling is enhanced by ( see fig. ) , while in the other three model , the coupling is suppressed either by or by the singlet component of the . fig. shows that the l2hdm predicts the largest rate for with its value reaching in optimum case , and for the other three models , the ratio of is at least about one order smaller than that of . this feature can be easily understood from the coupling introduced in sect . we emphasize that , if the nature prefers a light , and/or in the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm will be observable at the gigaz . then by the rates of the two decays , one can determine whether the type - ii 2hdm or the l2hdm is the right theory . on the other hand , if both decays are observed with small rates or fail to be observed , the singlet extensions of the mssm are favored . in fig. , we show the rate of as the function of . this figure indicates that the branching ratio of can reach , , and for the optimal cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively , which implies that the decay will never be observable at the gigaz if the studied model is chosen by nature . the reason for the smallness is , as we pointed out before , that the decay proceeds only at loop level . comparing the optimum cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm shown in fig.5 - 7 , one may find that the relation holds for any of the decays . this is because the decays are all induced by the yukawa couplings with similar structure for the models . in the supersymmetric models , the large singlet component of the light is to suppress the yukawa couplings , and the in the nmssm has more singlet component than that in the nmssm . next we consider the decay , which , unlike the above decays , depends on the higgs self interactions . in fig. we plot its rate as a function of and this figure indicates that the may be the largest among the ratios of the exotic decays , reaching in the optimum cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm and the nmssm . the underlying reason is , in some cases , the intermediate state in fig. ( a ) may be on - shell . in fact , we find this is one of the main differences between the nmssm and the nmssm , that is , in the nmssm , in fig. ( a ) may be on - shell ( corresponds to the points with large ) while in the nmssm , this seems impossible . so we conclude that the decay may serve as an alternative channel to test new physics models , especially it may be used to distinguish the nmssm from the nmssm if the supersymmetry is found at the lhc and the is observed at the gigaz with large rate . before we end our discussion , we note that in the nmssm , the higgs boson may be lighter than without conflicting with low energy data from decays and the other observables ( see fig.- ) . in this case , is axion - like as pointed out in . we checked that , among the rare decays discussed in this paper , the largest branching ratio comes from which can reach . since in this case , the decay product of is highly collinear muon pair , detecting the decay may need some knowledge about detectors , which is beyond our discussion . in this paper , we studied the rare -decays  , and in the type - ii 2hdm , lepton - specific 2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , which predict a light cp - odd higgs boson . in the parameter space allowed by current experiments , the branching ratio can be as large as for , for and for , which implies that the decays and may be accessible at the gigaz option . since different models predict different size of branching ratios , these decays can be used to distinguish different model through the measurement of these rare decays . this work was supported in part by hastit under grant no . 2009hastit004 , by the national natural science foundation of china ( nnsfc ) under grant nos . 10821504 , 10725526 , 10635030 , 10775039 , 11075045 and by the project of knowledge innovation program ( pkip ) of chinese academy of sciences under grant no . . for some reviews , see , e.g. , m. a. perez , g. tavares - velasco and j. j. toscano , int . j. mod . a * 19 * , 159 ( 2004 ) ;

{"article": "it is well known that the classical magnetoresistance ( mr ) in metals or semiconductors with a closed free electron fermi surface increases quadratically with increasing magnetic field for and saturates when . here is the zero - magnetic - field mobility . hence , the extraordinarily high and linear mr ( lmr ) , which breaks this familiar rule , has been gaining much attention as soon as its discovery . in the past decade , this unexpected lmr has been reported in silver chalcogenide, indium antimonide, silicon, mnas - gaas composite material, and graphene. kapitza s linear law indicates that the metal shows a magnetoresistance linear in perpendicular magnetic field when it has an open fermi surface and a mean free path longer than the electronic larmor radius . recently , another two models , irrespective of the open fermi surface , have been constructed to provide possible mechanisms for the lmr phenomenon . abrikosov suggested a quantum - limit origin of lmr for the homogenous system with a gapless linear energy spectrum. his model requires that landau levels are well formed and the carrier concentration is small that all electrons occupy only the lowest landau band . alternatively , parish and littlewood developed a classical model without involving linear spectrum. ignoring the concrete microscopic mechanism , they attributed this unusual mr to the mobility fluctuations in a strongly inhomogenous system . topological insulators ( tis ) are novel materials with a full energy gap in bulk , while there are gapless surface states . due to its unique band structure with only one helical dirac cone and linear energy dispersion, the surface states of the ti bise become an excellent platform for the study of quantum - limit lmr . the recent experiment in this flat surface system , however , reported that a large positive mr , which becomes very linear above a characteristic field of t , was observed even in an opposite situation where the carrier sheet density is high that electrons occupy more than one landau levels. moreover , they found that raising temperature to room temperature almost has no influence on the observed lmr . it is striking that this observation is in conflict with abrikosov s model and also with the classical parish - littlewood model . so far a reliable theoretical scheme capable of explaining this novel experiment has still been lacking . in this paper , we generalize the balance - equation approach to a system modeling the surface states of a three - dimensional ti to investigate the two - dimensional magnetotransport in it . we find that a positive , nonsaturating and dominantly linear magnetoresistance can appear within quite wide magnetic - field range in the ti surface state having a positive and finite effective g - factor . this linear magnetoresistance shows up in the system of high carrier concentration and low mobility when electrons are in extended states and spread over many smeared landau levels , and persists up to room temperature , providing a possible mechanism for the recently observed linear magnetoresistance in topological insulator bise nanoribbons. we consider the surface state of a bise-type large bulk gap ti in the - plane under the influence of a uniform magnetic field applied along the direction. following the experimental observation, we assume that the fermi energy locates in the gap of the bulk band and above the dirac point , i.e. the surface carriers are electrons . further , the separations of the fermi energy from the bottom of bulk band and dirac point are much larger than the highest temperature  considered in this work . hence , the contribution from the bulk band to the magnetotransport is negligible . these electrons , scattered by randomly distributed impurities and by phonons , are driven by a uniform in - plane electric field in the topological surface . the hamiltonian of this many - electron and phonon system consists of an electron part , a phonon part , and electron - impurity and electron - phonon interactions and : here , the electron hamiltonian is taken in the form , \\ ] ] in which , , and , stand , respectively , for the canonical momentum , coordinate , momentum and spin operators of the th electron having charge , is the vector potential of the perpendicular magnetic field in the landau gauge , is the fermi velocity , is the effective g - factor of the surface electron , and is the bohr magneton with the free electron mass . the sum index in eq. goes over all electrons of total number in the surface state of unit area . in the frame work of balance equation approach, the two - dimensional center - of - mass ( c.m . ) momentum and coordinate and , and the relative - electron momenta and coordinates and are introduced to write the hamiltonian into the sum of a single - particle c.m . part and a many - particle relative - electron part : , with .\\ ] ] in this , is the canonical momentum of the center - of - mass and is the canonical momentum for the th relative electron . here we have also introduced c.m . spin operators and . the commutation relations between the c.m . spin operators and and the spin operators , and of the th electron are of order of : = n^{-1}2\\,{\\rm i}\\,\\varepsilon {\\beta 1\\beta 2\\beta 3}\\sigma j^{\\beta 3} ] , i.e. the relative - electron momenta and coordinates can be treated as canonical conjugate variables , the relative - motion part is just the hamiltonian of electrons in the surface state of ti in the magnetic field without the presence of the electric field . in terms of the c.m . coordinate and the relative electron density operator , the electron impurity and electron phonon interactions can be written as here and are respectively the impurity potential ( an impurity at randomly distributed position ) and electron phonon coupling matrix element in the plane - wave representation , and with and being the creation and annihilation operators for a phonon of wavevector in branch having frequency . velocity ( operator ) is the time variation of its coordinate : = v {\\rm f}(\\sigma {\\rm c}^y\\ , -\\sigma {\\rm c}^x\\ , ) ] . here is the single - particle lifetime and is the cyclotron frequency of linear - energy - dispersion system with being the zero - temperature fermi level . using a semi - empirical parameter to relate with the transport scattering time , and expressing with the zero - field mobility at finite temperature, we can write the landau - level broadening as ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] in the present study we consider the case of -doping , i.e. the fermi level is high enough above the energy zero of the dirac cone in the range of `` + ' ' -branch levels and the states of `` ''-branch levels are completely filled , that they are irrelevant to electron transport . special attention has to be paid to the level , since , depending on the direction of exchange potential the effective g - factor of a ti surface state , , can be positive , zero or negative. the sign and magnitude of the effective g - factor determines how many states of the zero level should be included in or excluded from the available states for electron occupation in the case of -doping at a magnetic field . ( i ) if , the level center is exactly at and the system is electron - hole symmetric . the total number of negative energy states ( including the states of the lower half of the level and states of the \"-branch levels ) and that of positive energy states ( including the states of the upper half of the level and states of the \"-branch levels ) do not change when changing magnetic field . therefore , the lower - half negative energy states of this level are always filled and the upper - half positive - energy states of it are available for the occupation of particles which are counted as electrons participating in transport in the case of -doping . ( ii ) for a finite positive , the level moves downward to negative energy and its distance to the nearest \"-branch level is closer than to the nearest + \" -branch level at finite magnetic field strength . this is equivalent to the opening of an increasingly enlarged ( with increasing ) energy gap between the + \" -branch states and the states of the zero - level and the \"-branch levels . the opening of a sufficient energy gap implies that with increasing magnetic field the states in the + \" -branch levels would no longer shrink into the zero - level , and thus the level should be completely excluded from the conduction band , i.e. only particles occupying the + \" -branch states are counted as electrons participating in transport in the case of -doping , when the magnetic field gets larger than a certain value ( depending on the magnitude of ) . ( iii ) for a finite negative , the level moves upward to positive energy and an increasingly enlarged energy gap will be opened between the states of the zero - level and the + \" -branch and the states of \"-branch levels , and particles occupying the level and + \" -branch states are electrons participating in transport when the magnetic field gets larger than a certain value . as a result , the experimentally accessible sheet density of electrons participating in transport is related to the fermi energy by the following equation valid at finite for the magnetic field larger than a certain value : in which + 1\\}^{-1} ] , even for the lowest landau level , i.e. the whole landau - level spectrum is smeared . with increasing the zero - field mobility the magnitude of resistivity decreases , and when the broadened landau - level width becomes smaller than the neighboring level interval , , a weak sdh oscillation begin to occur around the linearly - dependent average value of at higher portion of the magnetic field range , as seen in fig.(c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) for and . on the other hand , in the case of large mobility , e.g. , where the broadened landau - level widths are much smaller than the neighboring level interval even for level index as large as , the magnetoresistivity shows pronounced sdh oscillation and the linear - dependent behavior disappears , before the appearance of quantum hall effect, as shown in fig.(f ) . abrikosov s model for the lmr requires the applied magnetic field large enough to reach the quantum limit at which all the carriers are within the lowest landau level, while it is obvious that more than one landau levels are occupied in the experimental samples in the field range in which the linear and non - saturating magnetoresistivity was observed. for the given electron surface density , the number of occupied landau levels , or the filling factor , at different magnetic fields is shown in fig.(f ) , as well as in the fig.(d ) and ( e ) , where the integer - number positions of , i.e. filling up to entire landau levels , coincide with the minima of the density - of - states or the dips of sdh oscillation . this is in contrast with case , where the integer number of , which implies a filling up to the center position of the th landau levels , locates at a peak of sdh oscillation , as shown in fig.b . the observed sdh oscillations in the bise nanoribbon exhibiting nonsaturating surface lmr in the experiment favor the former case : a finite positive effective . is plotted as a function of the surface electron density at magnetic field : ( a ) at different values of zero - field mobility , and ( b ) at different values of zero - field conductivity .,scaledwidth=40.0% ] at various lattice temperatures . here the zero - magnetic - field mobility at zero temperature is .,scaledwidth=35.0% ] next , we examine the density - dependence of the linear magnetoresistivity . to compare with abrikosov s quantum magnetoresistance which suggests a behavior, we show the calculated for above lmr versus the carrier sheet density in fig. at fixed magnetic field t . the mobility is taken respectively to be and m/vs to make the resistivity in the lmr regime . a clearly linear dependence of on the surface density is seen in all cases , indicating that this non - saturating linear resistivity is almost inversely proportional to the carrier density . in the figure we also show versus under the condition of different given conductivity and . in this case the half - width is independent of surface density . the linear dependence still holds , indicating that this linear behavior is not sensitive to the modest -dependence of landau level broadening as long as the system is in the overlapped landau level regime . from the above discussion , it is obvious that lmr shows up in the system having overlapped landau levels and the separation of landau levels makes the mr departure from the linear increase . at high temperature , the thermal energy would smear the level separation and phonon scatterings further broaden landau levels . hence , it is believed that this lmr will be robust against raising temperature . this is indeed the case as seen in fig. , where we plot the calculated magnetoresistivity for the above system with zero - temperature linear mobility m/vs versus the magnetic field at different lattice temperatures . we can see that raising temperature to room temperature has little effect on the linearity of mr . due to the decreased mobility at higher temperature from phonon scattering , the weak sdh oscillation on the linear background tends to vanish . these features are in good agreement with the experimental report. in summary , we have studied the two - dimensional magnetotransport in the flat surface of a three - dimensional ti , which arises from the surface states with a wavevector - linear energy dispersion and a finite , positive zeeman splitting within the bulk energy gap . when the level broadening is comparable to or larger than the landau - level separation and the conduction electrons spread over many landau levels , a positive , dominantly linear and non - saturating magnetoresistance appears within a quite wide range of magnetic field and persists up to room temperature . this remarkable lmr provides a possible mechanism for the recently observed linear magnetoresistance in topological insulator bise nanoribbons. in contrast to quantum hall effect which appears in the case of well formed landau levels and to abrikosov s quantum magnetotransport, which is limited to the extreme quantum limit that all electrons coalesce into the lowest landau level , the discussed lmr is a phenomena of pure classical two - dimensional magnetotransport in a system having linear - energy - dispersion , appearing in the regime of overlapped landau levels , irrespective of its showing up in relatively high magnetic field range . furthermore , the present scheme deals with spatially uniform case without invoking the mobility fluctuation in a strongly inhomogeneous system , which is required in the classical parish and littlewood model to produce a lmr. the appearance of this significant positive - increasing linear magnetoresistance depends on the existence of a positive and sizable effective g - factor . if the zeeman energy splitting is quite small the resistivity would exhibit little change with changing magnetic field . in the case of a negative and sizable effective g - factor the magnetoresistivity would decrease linearly with increasing magnetic field . therefore , the behavior of the longitudinal resistivity versus magnetic field may provide a useful way for judging the direction and the size of the effective zeeman energy splitting in ti surface states . this work was supported by the national science foundation of china ( grant no . 11104002 ) , the national basic research program of china ( grant no . 2012cb927403 ) and by the program for science&technology innovation talents in universities of henan province ( grant no . 2012hastit029 ) .", "summary": "a positive , non -

{"article": "a magnitude limited complete census of variable stars in nearby dwarf galaxies allows important contributions to the star formation history of these systems . measurements of some variable stars can supply improved distance determinations for the host galaxies , others will provide important constraints for the population analysis . different classes of variables can further improve the understanding of the star formation history of these system , functioning as tracers of star formation during different epochs . we expect the data set of our long term monitoring program to be especially well suited to study the contents of red long - period variables and to re - investigate the paucity of cepheids with days as reported by sandage & carlson ( 1985 ) . we selected a sample of six local group dwarf irregular galaxies which are visible with the 0.8 m telescope of our institute at mt . the names and additional data from the literature compilation by mateo ( 1998 ) are shown in table 1 . .names , variable star counts , absolute -band brightness in mag , and current distance estimation in kpc for the dwarf galaxies observed in our project . the data are taken from the literature compilation by mateo ( 1995 ) . for leo a the data are from the work of dolphin et . al ( 2002 ) and from this work . this work the observations so far were carried out in and -band , sparsely sampling a three year period starting with test observations in 1999 . this part of the data set should be sensitive for long period variable stars with periods up to days . additional observations in , and -band were obtained during 3 observing campaigns at the 1.23 m telescope on calar alto densely sampling three two week long periods . these observations should provide a ground for a search for variable stars with shorter periods ranging from days up to days . the acquired data were bias subtracted , flat - fielded and cosmic ray rejected . then , the images from one night were astrometrically aligned to a common reference frame and combined with individual weights proportional to their . for each epoch , consisting of all the stacked images of a single night , a difference image against a common deep reference frame was created using an implementation ( gssl & riffeser , 2002 , 2003 ) of the alard algorithm ( alard & lupton , 1998 ) . finally , these difference images were convolved with a stellar psf . to extract lightcurves from the reduced data , first all pixels deviating significantly  from the reference image in a minimum number of epochs were flagged , utilizing the complete per - pixel error propagation of our data reduction pipeline . then , using these coordinates as input , values and associated errors are read from the difference images and the lightcurve data are assembled . to search for periodic signals in the extracted difference fluxes , a lomb ( 1976 ) algorithm using the interpretation from scargle ( 1982 ) is applied . the photometric calibration was conducted using the hst data published by schulte - ladbeck et al . for the galaxies leo a , and ugca 92 , we have a very good monitoring and a large fraction of the data passed already the pipeline . the leo a data set serves as test case : a total of 26 variable star candidates were detected . among them , we identified 16 secure long period variables ( typical average values , and period ) , and we have 8 further candidates for lpvs . in addition we were able to identify two good candidates for cephei stars with best fitting periods of 6.4 and 1.69 days . the later candidate was previously described by dolphin et al .

{"article": "in 1957 g.a . askaryan pointed out that ionisation and cavitation along a track of an ionising particle through a liquid leads to hydrodynamic radiation . in the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , theoretical and experimental studies have been performed on the hydrodynamic radiation of beams and particles traversing dense media . the interest in characterising the properties of the acoustic radiation was , among other reasons , lead by the idea that the effect can be utilised to detect ultra - high energy  cosmic , i.e. astrophysical neutrinos , in dense media like water , ice and salt . in the 1970s this idea was discussed within the dumand optical neutrino detector project and has been studied in connection with cherenkov neutrino detector projects since . the detection of such neutrinos is considerably more challenging than the search for high - energy neutrinos  as currently pursued by under - ice and under - water cherenkov neutrino telescopes . due to the low expected fluxes , detector sizes exceeding 100km are needed . however , the properties of the acoustic method allow for sparsely instrumented arrays with sensors / km . to study the feasibility of a detection method based on acoustic signals it is necessary to understand the properties of the sound generation by comparing measurements and simulations based on theoretical models . according to the so - called thermo - acoustic model , the energy deposition of particles traversing liquids leads to a local heating of the medium which can be regarded as instantaneous with respect to the hydrodynamic time scales . due to the temperature change the medium expands or contracts according to its bulk volume expansion coefficient . the accelerated motion of the heated medium generates an ultrasonic pulse whose temporal signature is bipolar and which propagates in the volume . coherent superposition of the elementary sound waves , produced over the cylindrical volume of the energy deposition , leads to a propagation within a flat disk - like volume in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the particle shower . in this study , the hydrodynamic signal generation by two types of beams , interacting with a water target , was investigated : pulsed protons and a pulsed laser , mimicking the formation of a hadronic cascade from a neutrino interaction under laboratory conditions . with respect to the aforementioned experimental studies of the thermo - acoustic model , the work presented here can make use of previously unavailable advanced tools such as geant4 for the simulation of proton - induced hadronic showers in water . good agreement was found in the comparison of the measured signal properties with the simulation results , providing confidence to apply similar simulation methods in the context of acoustic detection of ultra - high energy neutrinos . a puzzling feature observed in previous studies a non - vanishing signal amplitude at a temperature of 4c , where for water at its highest density no thermo - acoustic signal should be present was investigated in detail . such a residual signal was also observed for the proton beam experiment described in this article , but not for the laser beam , indicating that the formation of this signal is related to the charge or the mass of the protons . in the following , the thermo - acoustic model is derived from basic assumptions , using a hydrodynamic approach . basis is the momentum conservation , i.e. , the euler equation for mass density , velocity vector field of the medium and momentum - density tensor including the pressure . equation  can be derived from momentum conservation . in the derivation , energy dissipation resulting from processes such as internal friction or heat transfer are neglected . motions described by the euler equation hence are adiabatic . taking the three partial derivatives of eq .  with respect to and using for the density the continuity equation a non - linear wave equation can be derived : to solve this equation , the problem is approached in two separated spatial regions : firstly , a region ( ` beam ' ) , where the energy is deposited in the beam interactions with the fluid and thus the wave excited in a non - equilibrium process ; and secondly , a hydrodynamic ( ` acoustic ' ) region , where the acoustic wave propagates through the medium and where linear hydrodynamics in local equilibrium can be assumed . this splitting can be reflected by the momentum density tensor , rewriting it as in local equilibrium the changes in mass density are given by with the bulk volume expansion coefficient , the energy deposition , the adiabatic speed of sound in the medium and the specific heat . in the acoustic regime , where , the momentum density tensor can be expressed as ( using eqs. and  ) , where we assume an adiabatic density change with pressure . the non - linear kinetic term entering according to eq .  can be neglected for small deviations from the static density and small pressure differences from the static pressure . in the region b , where non - equilibrium deposition occur , one may make the ansatz with the direction of the beam which breaks the isotropy of the energy - momentum tensor and describes with the parameter in an effective way the momentum transfer on the fluid . although in non - equilibirum we apply eq .  with the energy deposition density of the beam . then , with the additional energy - momentum tensor due to the beam the wave equation  reads the general solution for the wave equation can be written using a green function approach as \\nonumber \\ ] ] with the components of the unit vector and the retarded time . for the last conversion , partial integration and the total derivative have been used repeatedly . note that for , so that the integration is carried out over the volume of the energy deposition region . assuming an energy deposition without momentum transfer to the medium , the kinetic term in the ansatz  can be neglected  yielding for a thermo - acoustic wave generated solely by heating of the medium . the signal amplitude can be shown to be proportional to the dimensionless quantity when solving eq .  for the case of an instantaneous energy deposition . equation  is equivalent to the results obtained from the approaches presented in . the derivation pursued above , however , uses a different approach starting with the euler equation and an anisotropic energy - momentum tensor , yielding a more general expression in eq .  . only if assuming an isotropic energy deposition one arrives at the expression for the pressure deviation given in eq .  . note that the validation of the last assumption being a good approximation would require a detailed knowledge of the momentum transfer from the beam to the medium . taking it into account would result in an additional dipol term in eq .  which may become the dominant contribution to wave generation if close to 4.0c . however , for the pressure field resulting from a beam interaction in a medium is determined by the spatial and temporal distribution of the energy deposition density alone . the amplitude of the resulting acoustic wave is governed by the thermodynamic properties , and , the latter three depending primarily on the temperature of the medium . a controlled variation of these parameters in the conducted laboratory experiments and a study of the resulting pressure signals therefore allows for a precise test of the thermo - acoustic model . simulations based on the thermo - acoustic model , as performed to interpret the results of the experiments described in the next section , will be discussed in sec . . note that the energy deposition density and its temporal evolution for the proton and laser beam interactions discussed in this paper are quite different from those expected for the interaction of ultra - high energy neutrinos . however , if a simulation starting from basic principles allows for a good reproduction of the experimental results , it is reasonable to assume that these simulation methods are transferable to neutrino interactions , as they are governed by the same underlying physical processes . the experiments presented in this paper were performed with a pulsed infrared nd : yag laser facility  located at the erlangen centre for astroparticle physics ( ecap ) of the university of erlangen , and the pulsed proton beam of the `` gustaf werner cyclotron '' at the `` theodor svedberg laboratory '' in uppsala , sweden . the beam properties allow for a compact experimental setup . in both cases , the beams were dumped into a dedicated water tank , where the acoustic field was measured with several position - adjustable acoustic sensors ( see fig . ) . the sensors ( also called hydrophones ) could be positioned within the tank with absolute uncertainties below 1 cm . the temperature of the water could be varied between and with a precision of . the temperature was brought to a particular value by first cooling the water with ice ; subsequently the whole water volume was heated to the desired temperature in a controlled , gradual procedure . once the water temperature had been established , at least 10min remained for measurements until the water volume heated up by through heat transfer from the environment . this time span was sufficient for all measurements conducted at water temperatures below the ambient temperature . the explored range of spill energies for the proton beam was from to , the beam diameter was approximately and the spill time . for protons , the energy deposition in the water along the beam axis ( -axis , beam entry into the water at ) is relatively uniform up to ending in the prominent bragg - peak at ( see fig . ) . to adjust the spill energy , the number of protons per bunch was varied . the total charge of a bunch was calibrated with two independent methods ( faraday cups and scintillation counters ) , leading to an uncertainty on the order of 15% , with some higher values for low spill energies . to obtain the beam intensity and profile for the proton interactions in the water tank , the distance of about 1.2 m that the beam was travelling from the exit of the beam pipe through air and its entering into the water tank were included in the geant4 simulation . for the laser experiment , the pulse energy was adjusted between and and calibrated using a commercial power meter . the beam had a diameter of approximately mm and the pulse length was fixed at . for the infrared light used , the laser energy density deposited along the beam axis has an exponential decrease with an absorption length of ( see fig . ) . for both beam types the lateral energy deposition profile was gaussian ( the aforementioned beam diameters are the s of the profiles ) . the two experiments allow to explore different spatial and temporal distributions of the energy deposition as well as two different mechanisms of energy transfer into the medium . for both beams , energy is deposited via excitation , in addition the medium is ionised in the case of the proton beam . , width=294 ] for the signal recording , sensors based on the piezo - electric effect were used . a full characterisation of these sensors had been performed prior to the experiments . they are linear in amplitude response , the frequency response is flat starting from a few khz up to the main resonance at with a sensitivity of ( .02v / pa ) . the main resonance is more sensitive by and sensitivity drops rapidly at higher frequencies ; at 90khz , the sensitivity has dropped by 20db . the absolute uncertainty in the determination of the sensitivity is at a level of 2db in the frequency range of interest . above 90khz the uncertainty exceeds 5db . to calculate the response of the sensors to an external pressure pulse a parametrised fit of an equivalent circuit model as described in was used . the sensitivity dependence on temperature was measured and the relative decrease was found to be less than ( or about 0.13db ) per . for every set of fixed experimental parameters ( temperature , energy , sensor position , etc . ) the signals of 1000 beam pulses were recorded with a digital oscilloscope at a sampling rate in excess of . this rate is sufficient for the signals with spectral components up to 100khz , where the sensitivity of the sensors is negligibly small . these individual pulses were averaged to reduce background and environmental noise in the analysis , thereby obtaining a very high statistical precision . figure shows typical signals measured in the proton and the laser experiment , respectively , using the same sensors and experimental setup . the general shapes of the two signals differ : a typical signal for the proton beam shows a bipolar signature , the one for the laser deviates from such a generic form . the laser signal has high frequency components up to several mhz due to the high energy deposition density at the point of beam entry and the almost instantaneous energy deposition compared to the s pulse of the proton beam ; therefore the resonance of the sensor is excited causing a ringing in the measured signal . the spatial distribution of the energy density deposited by the laser leads to the two separate signals : the first originates in the beam area at the same -region as the sensor placement ( ` direct signal ' ) , the second from the beam entry , a point of discontinuity where most of the energy is deposed ( ` beam entry signal ' ) . the signal of the proton beam is deteriorated with respect to an ideal bipolar signal . three main contributions to this distortion can be discerned : the recorded signal starts before the expected onset of the acoustic signal ( 55.2s for the given position , see fig . , given by the sonic path length ) ; reflections of the acoustic wave on the beam entry window overlay the original wave starting in the first rare - faction peak ; and finally there are frequency components of the signal exciting a resonant response of the sensor , slightly changing the signal shape and causing ringing . the first point was studied and found to be consistent with an electric charge effect in the sensors caused by the proton beam . its starting time was always coincident with the beam pulse entry into the water , even for sensor distances of up to 1 m , hinting at an electromagnetic origin of the distorting signal . the shape of this non - acoustic signal is consistent with the integrated time - profile of the beam pulse with a subsequent exponential decay . this deformation of the main signal is considered a systematic uncertainty on the signal properties and treated as such in the analysis . for the most part , its shape was fitted and subtracted from the signal . in order to minimise the impact of the signal deformation caused by the described effects on the analysis of the recorded signals , robust characteristics were used : the peak - to - peak amplitude and the signal length from maximum to minimum of the signal . for the laser experiment these features were extracted for the direct signals only . = 10 cm and =20 cm and are shown within the same time interval . the dash - dotted line in the upper graph indicates the charge effect described in the text . , width=264 ] for an in - depth validation of the thermo - acoustic model , comparisons of the signal properties with simulation results based on the model are essential . to this end , a simulation of the expected signals was developed . it is based on the thermo - acoustic model using a numeric solution of eq .  . the input parameters to the simulation were either measured at the experiments , i.e. medium temperature and beam profiles , or simulated , i.e. the energy deposition of the protons ( using geant4 ) . the thermodynamic parameters bulk volume expansion coefficient , heat capacity and speed of sound were derived from the measured water temperature using standard parametrisations . tap water quality was assumed . a series of simulations was conducted , where the input parameters were varied individually in the range given by the experiment , including uncertainties . especially the spatial and temporal beam profile have a substantial impact on amplitude , duration and shape of the signal . simulated signals and the respective sensor response corresponding to the measured signals of fig . are shown in fig. . to minimise systematic effects from the setup caused e.g. by reflections on the surfaces , the sensor response was convoluted onto the simulated signals , rather than deconvoluted from the measured ones . thus in the analysis voltage rather than pressure signals are compared . . the corresponding dashed - lined signals mark the simulated signals after convolution with the sensor response . for better comparability , the signal maxima were normalised to 1 . , width=264 ] the shapes of the simulated pulses are altered by the sensor response , especially the high - frequency components above the resonant frequency of the sensor . in the case of the laser pulse , mostly the resonance of the sensor is excited , leading to a strong ringing . for the proton beam , the primarily bipolar shape is again prominent , whereas the laser pulse is segmented into the two parts described above . the direct pulse of the laser experiment exhibits a bipolar shape as well , albeit less symmetric than for the proton beam . figure exemplifies the dependency of the signal amplitude on the input parameters of the simulation : water temperature , pulse energy , beam profile in and , pulse length and the position of the sensor . as nominal positions of the sensor m , m , and m were used . all parameters were varied by around the value of the best agreement with measurement , i.e. the values used for the simulations of the signals shown in fig . . some of the characteristics of thermo - acoustic sound generation are observable . as discussed in sec . , the dependence on temperature enters through the factor ( where the dependence on the speed of sound is negligible ) and is roughly linear in the range investigated for this study . the dependence on energy is strictly linear . the dependency on the beam pulse parameters is diverse . it is governed by the integral in eq. and therefore depends on both the spatial and the temporal beam profiles and the interaction of the particles with the water . for a given point in space and time , the elementary waves produced in the volume of energy deposition may interfere constructively or destructively depending on the beam properties . accordingly , the length of the laser pulse has no influence on the amplitude , as with 9ns it is much shorter than the transit time of the acoustic signal through the energy deposition area . for the several ten s long proton spill , the spill time is comparable to the transit time . thus the acoustic signal shows a strong dependence on the spill time . the dependence on the radial coordinate w.r.t . the beam axis follows roughly the expected 1/ and fall - off of a cylindric source in the near and the far field , respectively . the -position was varied between and 2 cm , as the signals were recorded within the -plane . the resulting change in amplitude is below 1% . the -dependency for the laser experiment follows the exponential fall - off expected from the light absorption . the one for the proton experiment shows the only non - strictly monotonic behaviour due to the form of the energy deposition with the prominent bragg peak . using these dependencies the systematic uncertainties of the model were obtained using the experimental uncertainties of the various parameters . the main uncertainty for the proton beam is given by the temporal profile of the pulse , which was simplified to a gaussian profile for this chapter ( however not for the rest of this work ) . for the laser beam experiment this parameter influences the signal amplitude only on a one percent level . the second main influence on the amplitude is the sensor position along the beam axis ( -direction ) . table gives the parameters and their uncertainties  used for the simulation of the signals . the resulting systematic uncertainties in the amplitude  are given as well . the combined uncertainties are for the proton signal and for the laser signal , respectively . .beam parameters used for the simulated signals in fig . with their associated experimental uncertainties  and resulting uncertainty in signal amplitude  . the pulse length of the laser is set to a value much higher than in the experiment , to save calculation time . the resulting uncertainty in the signal amplitude is below in the following , the results obtained in the comparison of experiment and simulation are presented . figure shows a comparison between simulated and measured signals for the proton beam experiment at different sensor positions . for better visibility only the main part of the signals ( first bipolar part ) is plotted . the input parameters of the simulation were varied within the experimental uncertainties until the best agreement with the measured signal in amplitude and duration was obtained for the reference point at =0.40 m and =0.11 m . for this optimisation , a simple procedure of adjusting the parameters manually and scanning the resulting agreement visually was found to be sufficient . the other signals were simulated with the same parameter set , only the sensor positions were changed . the signal shapes differ for different -positions due to the geometry of the energy deposition profile described in sec . with cylindric form in the -plane and almost flat energy density in -direction up to the bragg peak at =0.22 m . due to this geometry an almost cylindrical wave is excited in the medium , with coherent emission perpendicular to the beam axis . in the region m the signals are of bipolar shape . along the beam axis ( m , m ) the main part of the observed signal originates from the bragg peak as a nearly spheric source and no clear bipolar shape evolves . the agreement between simulation and measurement is good for all positions . not only amplitude and duration match ( see also the following sections ) but also the signal shape is reproduced to a very high degree . the small discrepancies , primarily in the rare - faction part of the bipolar pulse , have contributions stemming from a non - ideal sensor calibration and reflections on the tank surfaces . however , a significant part of the discrepancies may lie in the beam pulse modelling or even the thermo - acoustic model itself . the prominent feature of the energy deposition of the laser beam is at the beam entry into the medium . overall , the geometry of this deposition is mainly a cylindric one with rotational symmetry around the -axis , as for the proton beam , with coherent emission perpendicular to the beam axis ( direct signal ) . the signal from the discontinuity at the beam entry is emitted almost as from a point source ( beam entry signal ) . in contrast to the proton beam , the shapes of signals at different positions along the -axis do not vary much , only the relative timing between the two signal components varies . therefore , fig . shows only signals for a -position in the middle of the water tank . here , both signal parts are well described by the simulation . the beam entry part of each signal is less well reproduced in the simulation due to its high frequency components where the sensor calibration is less well understood . + m for different sensor positions along ( reference at m ) . for more details , width=325 ] to compare the characteristics of the signals in simulation and measurement in the following studies , their amplitudes and the point in time of the recording of the signal maximum were further studied . for the laser signal , the direct signal part is considered only . equation  yields as velocity of propagation for the thermo - acoustic signal the speed of sound in the medium , here water . to verify the hydrodynamic origin of the measured signals the variation of the arrival times for different sensor positions perpendicular to the beam axis were analysed . figure shows the measured data and a linear fit for each beam type . the data is compatible with an acoustic sound propagation in water , as the fits yield a speed of sound compatible with pure water at the temperature used . for the proton beam  was obtained for a water temperature of c , where literature gives for pure water at normal pressure which is in complete agreement . for the laser measurements the water temperature of c and thus the speed of sound were significantly higher , the observed  is again in perfect agreement with the theoretical value of . the offset between proton and laser beam data in fig . is due to a differing delay time in between trigger time and arrival time of the different beams in the water and is irrelevant for the calculation of the speed of sound . position ) . the straight lines represent linear fits to the data points yielding and for the proton and laser beam , respectively . , width=325 ] the durations of the complete , unclipped signals vary with sensor positions mainly due to reflections , which were not simulated and can therefore not be compared . the comparison of simulated and measured signals for different sensor positions within the water tank , excluding the parts of the signals dominated by reflections , was shown in fig . . the good agreement between model and measurement also manifests itself in the development of the signal amplitude with distance of sensors from the beam axis , shown in fig . . to minimise systematic effects from reflections , only the amplitude of the leading maximum is analysed . though there are sizeable deviations , the overall shape of the curve is reproduced . the behaviour is again different for the two -positions . the development at m follows the one expected from a cylindric source with a behaviour in the near field up to m and a behaviour in the far field beyond that distance . at the smallest measured distances , the simulated behaviour deviates from the measured one . presumably this is due to simplifications made in the derivation of the model in sec . . at m the amplitude falls off more uniformly , this is again a combination of the point - like emission characteristic of the bragg peak interfering with the cylindric emission at m . ) for the proton beam experiment . points mark the measured amplitudes for two different -positions and the lines the respective simulation results . , width=325 ] the behaviour for the laser experiment is not as well reproduced by the simulation ( see fig . ) . this is again attributed to the high - frequent signal components of the laser , where minor uncertainties in the simulation may result in big changes of the signal amplitude . especially the overlap of the direct with the beam entry window signal distort the signal shape . at distances exceeding 0.5 m the two signal parts can not be distinguished . ) for the laser beam experiment . points mark the measured amplitudes at m and the line the simulation result . , width=325 ] assuming otherwise unchanged settings , the energy deposition density scales linearly with total deposited energy . thus the spill energy can be written as a pre - factor in eq .  effecting the pressure and thus signal amplitude linearly . as shown in fig . this behaviour was observed in the experiments yielding a zero - crossing of the pulse energy at mpa for the proton beam and mpa for the laser beam . both values are consistent with zero . the slope of the line depends on the energy deposition and the sensor positioning along the beam axis and can therefore not be compared for the two beams . as expected from the model , the signal duration and signal shape showed no significant dependence on energy . m. there is a ten percent systematic uncertainty in the absolute determination of the pulse energy . the lines represent linear fits to the data points yielding a zero - crossing of the amplitude compatible with no energy in a pulse . the insert shows the data for the proton beam. , width=325 ] the main feature of the thermo - acoustic model is its dependence on the temperature of the medium . figure shows the temperature dependence of the signal peak - to - peak amplitude for the laser beam , where a positive ( negative ) sign denotes a leading positive ( negative ) peak of the signal . the two data sets shown in the figure were recorded by two sensors simultaneously , which were positioned at perpendicular to the beam axis and at and along the beam axis , respectively . in the case of the proton beam setup , which will be discussed below , these hydrophone positions correspond roughly to the -position of the bragg - peak and a -position half way between the bragg - peak and the beam entry into the water , respectively . for comparability , the same positions and the same sensors were chosen for the laser and proton beam experiments . at . the insert shows a blow - up of the region around c where the sign of the amplitude changes . ,width=325 ] the laser beam signal shown in fig . changes its polarity around , as expected from the thermo - acoustic model . the theoretical expectation for the signal amplitude , which is proportional to and vanishes at for the given temperature and pressure , is fitted to the experimental data . in the fit , an overall scaling factor and a shift in temperature ( for the experimental uncertainty in the temperature measurement ) were left free as fit parameters . the fit yielded a zero - crossing of the amplitude at , where the error is dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the temperature setting . c , fitted with the model expectation as described in the text . a systematic deviation from the model expectation as the amplitude changes its sign is clearly visible . the amplitudes were normalised to at . , width=325 ] . to allow for an easy comparison of the signal shapes , a point in time at the onset of the acoustic signals was chosen as zero time and for all signal amplitudes the corresponding offset was added or subtracted to yield a zero amplitude at that time . , width=325 ] analysing the proton data in the same fashion resulted in a fit that deviated from the model expectation , and a zero - crossing significantly different from at , see fig . . the data strongly indicate the presence of a systematic effect near the zero - crossing of the signal amplitude . to understand this effect , the signal shapes near the temperature of were investigated ( fig . ) . a non - vanishing signal is clearly observable at and the signal inverts its polarity between and . in view of the results from the laser beam measurements and the obvious systematic nature of the deviation from the model visible in fig . , we subtracted the residual signal at , which has an amplitude of of the signal , from all signals . thus a non - temperature dependent effect in addition to the thermo - acoustic signal was assumed . the resulting amplitudes shown in fig . are well described by the model prediction . c was subtracted at every temperature . the amplitudes were afterwards normalised to at . the insert shows a blow - up of the region around c where the sign of the amplitude changes . , width=325 ] the production mechanism of the underlying signal at , which was only observed in the proton experiment , could not be unambiguously determined with the performed measurements . from the model point of view , the main simplification for the derivation of eq .  was to neglect all non - isotropic terms and momentum transfer to the medium in the momentum density tensor by setting in eq .  . as discussed in sec . , dipole radiation could contribute significantly near the disappearance of the volume expansion coefficient for the case . also other non - thermo - acoustic signal production mechanism have been discussed in the literature which could give rise to an almost temperature independent signal , see e.g. . the obvious difference to the laser experiment are the charges involved both from the protons themselves and the ionisation of the water which could lead to an interaction with the polar water molecules . another difference are the massive protons compared to massless photons . residual signals at were found in previous works as well , as will be discussed in more detail in sec . . for clarification further experiments are needed either with ionising neutral particles ( e.g. synchrotron radiation ) or with charged particles ( e.g. protons , -particles ) with more sensors positioned around the bragg - peak . with such experiments it might be possible to distinguish between the effect of ionisation in the water and of net charge introduced by charged particles . with the analysis that has been described above , the signal production according to the thermo - acoustic model could be unambiguously confirmed . while the model has been confirmed in previous experiments , the simulations presented in this work constitute a new level of precision . the most puzzling feature , a residual signal at 4c that was also observed in previous experiments , was investigated with high precision by scanning the relevant temperature region in steps of c . the observed shift of the zero - crossing of the amplitude towards values higher than 4c , caused by a leading rarefaction non - thermal residual signal at 4c , is in qualitative agreement with . in , a residual signal at c was also reported . since in that work the zero - crossing of the amplitude is observed at c , i.e.a higher value than the expected c , it can be assumed that the corresponding residual signal has a leading rarefaction . in , a residual signal is found at c , however with a leading compression rather than rarefaction . the authors conclude that this may lead to a signal disappearance point below the expected value , in contrast to and the work presented in this article . for the measurements with a laser beam reported in , a residual signal was also observed at c , albeit with a leading compression and a subsequent reduction of the temperature of the zero - crossing of the signal amplitude to about c . this observation is in contrast to the laser experiment presented in this article . in conclusion , the works of all authors discussed here indicate a non - thermal residual signal for proton beams , albeit with varying results concerning the size of the effect and the shape of the underlying non - thermal signal . the results for the laser beam reported in differ from those described in the article at hands . it should be pointed out , however , that in and results are reported by the same authors for proton and for laser beams , respectively . a comparison of these two publications shows that a different behaviour near the temperature of c was observed for the two types of beams . hence , to the best of our knowledge , there are currently no results in contradiction with the notion of different non - thermal effects in the interaction of proton vs. laser beams with water . the available data does not allow for a more detailed analysis of the correlation between experimental conditions and the temperature of the zero - crossing of the signal amplitude . efforts to detect neutrinos at ultra - high energies are at the frontier of research in the field of astroparticle physics . neutrinos are the only viable messengers at ultra - high energies beyond the local universe , i.e. distances well beyond several tens of megaparsecs . if successful , the investigation of these elusive particles will not only enhance the understanding of their own nature , but also provide important complementary information on the astrophysical phenomena and the environments that accelerate particles to such extreme energies . for acoustic particle detection , not only the technical aspects such as optimal design and detector layout are subject of research . but also the underlying physics processes the formation of hadronic cascades resulting from neutrino interactions in dense media have never been observed directly in detector experiments at these energies . producing ever more reliable extrapolation of reaction properties to ultra - high energies is an ongoing effort . with advancements in the simulations of cascades forming in water and improvements of detector simulation tools , the discrepancy between cascade parameters from independent simulations decreased : recent studies differ only slightly . at the same time it is necessary to gain a solid understanding of the sound signals generated from the energy depositions by particle cascades . for this purpose , laboratory measurements are required . this work , together with others has established the validity of the thermo - acoustic model with uncertainties at the level . the input to a model as discussed in this article is an energy deposition in water as it is also produced by a cascade that evolves from a neutrino interaction . in comparison with the uncertainty in the thermo - acoustic model , uncertainties due to the simulations of hadronic cascades and cascade - to - cascade variations are large , dominating the challenge to detect and identify sound signals resulting from neutrino interactions . it can hence be concluded that the current level of precision in modelling sound signals in the context of the thermo - acoustic model is fully sufficient for the understanding of acoustic neutrino signatures . the latter is necessary to improve the selection efficiency and background rejection for neutrino detection algorithms in potential future acoustic neutrino detectors . several experiments have been conducted to understand the acoustic background at the sites of potential future large - scale acoustic neutrino telescopes in sea water , fresh water and ice . the combination of simulation efforts , laboratory measurements and studies with in - situ test arrays will allow for a conclusion of the feasibility of acoustic neutrino detection . we have demonstrated that the sound generation mechanism of intense pulsed beams is well described by the thermo - acoustic model . in almost all aspects investigated , the signal properties are consistent with the model . the biggest uncertainties of the experiments are on the 10 level . one discrepancy is the non - vanishing signal at 4c for the proton beam experiment , which can be described with an additional non - temperature dependent signal with a contribution to the amplitude at 15c . the model allows for calculations of the characteristics of sound pulses generated in the interaction of high energy particles in water with the input of the energy deposition of the resulting cascade . a possible application of this technique would be the detection of neutrinos with energies this work was supported by the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) by grants 05cn2we1/2 , 05cn5we1/7 and 05a08we1 . parts of the measurements were performed at the `` theodor svedberg laboratory '' in uppsala , sweden . the authors wish to thank all involved personnel and especially the acoustics groups of desy zeuthen and of uppsala university for their support .", "summary": "the generation of hydrodynamic radiation in interactions of pulsed proton and laser beams with matter is explored . the beams were directed into a water target and the resulting acoustic signals were recorded with pressure sensitive sensors . measurements were performed with varying pulse energies , sensor positions , beam diameters and temperatures . the obtained data are matched by simulation results based on the thermo - acoustic model with uncertainties at a level of 10 . the results imply that the primary mechanism for sound generation by the energy deposition of particles propagating in water is the local heating of the medium . the heating results in a fast expansion or contraction and a pressure pulse of bipolar shape is emitted into the surrounding medium . an interesting , widely discussed application of this effect could be the detection of ultra - high energetic cosmic neutrinos in future large - scale acoustic neutrino detectors . for this application a validation of the sound generation mechanism to high accuracy , as achieved with the experiments discussed in this article , is of high importance . cosmic neutrinos , acoustic neutrino detection , thermo -

{"article": "the epoch of reionization signified the appearance of the first stars and galaxies within the first billion years after the big bang , and the transformation of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from opaque to transparent . despite recent progress , however , it is not yet fully understood . it is now well established that reionization is completed by thanks to observations of the ly forest ( e.g. ) , and that the universe was substantially ionized around redshift when its age was less than 600 myr , based on the electron scattering optical depth measured by planck . however , there is still substantial uncertainty regarding the sources of reionization . can galaxies form with sufficient efficiency at such early times to provide enough reionizing photons ( e.g. ) , or is the process possibly driven by other classes of objects such as agn ? observationally , recent progress in near - ir detector technology has dramatically advanced our ability to search for galaxies during this epoch . following the installation of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , a continuously growing sample of galaxy candidates at is accumulating thanks to a variety of surveys . these range from small - area ultradeep observations such as the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf , ) , to shallower , larger - area searches for galaxies either in legacy fields such as the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; ) , or taking advantage of random - pointing opportunities like in the brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) survey ( go 11700 , 12572 , 13767 ; pi trenti ) . overall , a sample approaching 1000 galaxy candidates at is known today , and we are beginning to identify the first galaxy candidates from the first 500 million years ( ; ) . these observations provide solid constraints on the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) out to , which appears to be overall well described by a form , , as at lower redshift . however , other studies suggest that bright galaxy formation might not be suppressed as strongly at , and either a single power law or a double power law fit to the bright end of the lf has been explored . this change in the shape of the bright end is in turn connected theoretically to the physics of star formation in the most overdense and early forming environments where the brightest and rarest galaxies are expected to live . a departure from a schechter form could indicate a lower efficiency of feedback processes at early times , which in turn would imply an increase in the production of ionizing photons by galaxies . additionally , at , the observed number density of bright galaxies is affected by magnification bias , and this bias can cause the lf to take on a power - law shape at the bright end . currently , the samples at are still too small to draw any conclusion on which scenario is realized , since only a handful of candidates are known . in addition to constraining the shape of the lf , the brightest high- candidates identified by hst observations are also ideal targets for follow - up observations to infer stellar population properties such as ages and stellar masses , ionization state of the igm , and spectroscopic redshift . for the latter , confirmation of photometric candidates relies typically on detection of a lyman break in the galaxy continuum , ( e.g. , ) and/or of emission lines , primarily lyman- ( e.g. ) or other uv lines such as ciii ] or civ . spectroscopic follow - up for sources at is extremely challenging , with only limits on line emission resulting from most observations . yet , the brightest targets show significant promise of detection based on the latest series of follow - ups which led to spectroscopic confirmation out to , with several other ly detections at . with the goal of complementing the discovery of the rarest and most luminous sources in the epoch of reionization from legacy fields such as candels , the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey ( borg , see ) has been carrying out pure - parallel , random pointing observations with wfc3 since 2010 . borg identified a large sample  of -band dropouts with ( ; see also ) . this represents a catalog of galaxies that is not affected by large scale structure bias ( sample or `` cosmic '' variance ; see ) , which is especially severe for rare sources sitting in massive dark matter halos  , as inferred from clustering measurements at . follow - up spectroscopy of the borg dropouts with keck and vlt has provided evidence for an increase of the igm neutrality at compared to . currently , a new campaign of observations is ongoing , with a revised filter - set optimized for the new frontier of redshift detection at ( borg ; go 13767 , pi trenti ) . initial results from of the dataset ( arcmin ) led to the identification of two candidates at with , which are similar in luminosity to the spectroscopically confirmed source reported by , but significantly brighter than the six -dropouts with identified in the goods / candels fields from a comparable area . these recent developments indicate that it might be possible for a small number of ultra - bright sources  to be present as early as 500 myr after the big bang . thus , they prompted us to systematically analyze the borg archival data from observations in the previous cycles , which cover arcmin , to search for bright candidates and constrain their number density . this paper presents the results of this search , and is organized as follows : section briefly introduces the borg dataset . section discusses our selection criteria for sources ( -band dropouts ) , with results presented in section . in section , we determine the galaxy uv luminosity function at , and compare with previous determinations . section summarizes and concludes . throughout the paper we use the cosmology : , and . all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system . we use data acquired as part of the brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) survey , which consists of core borg pointings ( go 11700 , 12572 , 12905 ) , augmented by other pure parallel archival data ( go 11702 , pi yan , ) and cos gto coordinated parallel observations . for an in - depth description of the survey , we refer the reader to . here , we use the 2014 ( dr3 ) public release of the data , which consists of 71 independent pointings covering a total area of arcmin . all fields were imaged using the wfc3/ir filters f098 m , f125w and f160w , and in the optical band , using either the wfc3 f606w or f600lp filter . we refer to the wfc3 f098 m , f125w and f160w images as the , and images , and to the f606w and f600lp images as and , respectively . exposure times in each filter vary on a field - by - field basis , and 5 limiting magnitudes for point sources and aperture are between , with a typical value of . we note that since the dataset originates from parallel observations when the primary instrument is a spectrograph ( cos or stis ) , there is no dithering of the exposures . to compensate for the lack of dithering , the borg data reduction pipeline has been augmented with a customized laplacian edge filtering algorithm developed by . overall , the lack of dithering has a minimal impact  on the image and photometric quality , as it has been established through comparison between primary ( dithered ) versus pure - parallel observations of the same field . since the borg survey was designed to have as primary detection band , some fields have only a single short exposure in the -band . to ensure a consistently high image quality , here we include in the analysis only those fields with total exposure time in . this resulted in the exclusion of 9 fields out of 71 , so that the area included in our study is arcmin . the distribution of the exposure time in for the fields in borg is shown in figure . the borg public data release consists of reduced and aligned science images produced with ` multidrizzle ` with a pixel scale of , as well as associated weight maps ( see ) . following our standard analysis pipeline to search for dropouts in the data , we create rms maps from the weight maps , and normalize them to account for correlated noise induced by ` multidrizzle ` ( see ) . in short , this is done for each field and filter by measuring the noise in the image at random positions not associated with detected sources ( i.e. the `` sky '' noise ) , and comparing the measurement with the value inferred from the rms map , which can then be corrected by a multiplicative factor to match the measurement . our rescaling factors are on average for the ir filters and for ( see also ) . in addition , photometric zero - points are corrected to account for galactic reddening along each line of sight , according to . using ` sextractor ` in dual - image mode , we construct catalogues of sources in each field , using the -band image for detection . colors and signal to noise ratios are defined based on isophotal fluxes / magnitudes ( flux iso ) , while we adopt mag auto for the total magnitude of each source . to select galaxy candidates , we use the dropout technique . at high , neutral hydrogen in the igm almost completely absorbs uv photons , leading to a break at the galaxy rest wavelength of ly ( 1216 ) . for galaxies between , this implies a drop in the -filter , and non - detection in the and bands . our focus on -dropouts implies that our sample of candidates are essentially detected only in . therefore , to minimize the risk of introducing spurious sources , we require a clear detection in , with s / n . we also impose a strong break , trading sample completeness for higher purity , and require a color cut : , which is more conservative than the typical applied to legacy fields ( e.g. ) since we do not have the availability of multi - observatory data to constrain the continuum of candidates at longer wavelengths and help control contamination . overall , we impose the following criteria for selection as -dropouts : when computing the color , if the -band flux has s / n we use the limit instead . finally , to reduce the risk of contamination from detector defects surviving the data reduction pipeline , we further impose a stellarity cut through the ` sextractor ` class star parameter . we require class star , where 1 corresponds to a point source , and 0 to a diffuse light profile . we then visually inspected the dropouts that meet these criteria to reject any remaining detector artifacts and diffraction spikes . all the sources that meet all criteria and pass the visual inspection are listed in table , and discussed below . lccccccccccc borg 0240 -

band ( and ) detections , the photometric redshifts are sharply peaked around . the photometric probability distributions are included in figure alongside the images of the candidates . a comparison of the apparent magnitude against the photometric redshift of our candidates against candidates from other hst /wfc3 surveys is shown in figure . while two of our candidates are particularly bright in , they are consistent with previously - discovered candidates at by . we also determine the size of the candidates , starting from the observed half - light ( effective ) radius as determined by ` sextractor ` , which is translated into an intrinsic source size taking into account the effects of the point - spread function ( psf ) broadening and surface brightness limits following . the empirical relation has been constructed by inserting and recovering artificial sources with known input size and magnitude into borg images . source size is very helpful to help discriminate between high- and low- sources , since direct measurements by on candels galaxies show that sources are more compact than contaminants with similar colors . this empirical separation might be related to an approximate scaling of galaxy sizes as with , although a recent study by highlights that the intrinsic sizes likely evolve less strongly with redshift  compared to observed sizes . we discuss the contamination of our sample further in section . this candidate is the brightest in the sample , with magnitude . it is robustly detected in at , and marginally detected in at , even though it is close to the edge of the chip . the source has a very red color , with . it also shows extended structure , and has . its photometric redshift solution is sharply peaked at , with a broad higher - redshift wing . this candidate , in the same field as the previous one is detected with magnitude , making it the second - brightest source in the sample . it is detected with s / n in , and again marginally detected with s / n in . it is the most extended source in the sample , with . its photometric redshift , like borg 0240 - 1857 129 , is peaked at , with a broad higher - redshift wing . field borg 0240 - 1857 includes a third bright candidate with , detected at s / n . this source is not detected in the other bands ( , or ) . unlike the two brighter candidates , this object is more compact , with a measured half - light radius . this is smaller than the psf of the image  , indicating that it could be a point - source - like contaminant such as a cool dwarf star , although the stellarity of this source is , which is lower than the value expected for a point source ( e.g. uses class star and class star to exclude stars ) . this candidate is close to a foreground galaxy with , with a centre - to - centre projected separation of . while this foreground galaxy has an uncertain photometric redshift solution , it is likely to be at , based on its compact size . using the framework developed by and , we estimate the gravitational lensing of this source . magnification pdfs are obtained by estimating velocity dispersions from magnitudes , using the empirical redshift - dependent faber - jackson relations given in and . velocity dispersion is the best tracer of the strength of a strong gravitational lens . the einstein radii of the foreground objects are modelled as singular isothermal spheres ( e.g. ) which depend on the velocity dispersion and the angular diameter distance to the source , and between the lens and source ( where we use the best photo- values ) . assuming that the foreground source is at ( which maximizes lensing magnification ) , we infer a magnification . this object has a magnitude  , and is detected in the only , with an extended but compact structure ( effective radius ) . the source is located relatively close ( separation ) to a hot pixel , which appears in the and images . the -band image is unaffected since it was acquired in a later orbit than the images in bluer bands . we carefully examined the individual flt files and conclude that since the separation between the source center and the hot pixel is larger than twice , and there is no sign of a hot pixel in the -band , the identification of the candidate as a -dropout is robust . this candidate is detected with a magnitude , and has s / n . it is not detected in , or . it has an effective radius of . this candidate is close to a foreground object ( centre - to - centre projected separation ) . the foreground object has an apparent magnitude , and is at an indeterminate photometric redshift . we use the same modelling framework as for borg 0240 - 1857 25 to estimate the lensing magnification of this source . assuming that the source is at , we find a maximum . analysis of the flt images of this field highlighted the presence of a bad pixel , correctly identified and masked by the data reduction pipeline , at the outer edge of the segmentation map of the dropout candidate in one of the two frames . to determine the impact on the final photometry , we measured the source flux in the flt frames separately , finding that the candidate is detected with s / n in the unaffected image and also s / n in the image affected by the bad pixel . hence , we are confident that the source is real and that the photometry from the final drizzled image is robust . the sixth and final candidate is confidently detected at s / n in  , and also in the with s / n = 3.7 . its photometric redshift is sharply peaked at , with a secondary solution at . this candidate is also very compact , with measured half - light radius , and the highest stellarity of the sample ( class star = 0.91 ) . combining compactness with high stellarity from a high s / n source , a stellar nature ( cool dwarf ) for this source is relatively likely , as we discuss in section . to translate the results on the search of possible candidates at from the archival borg data into a number density / luminosity function determination , we need to assess both the impact of contamination in our sample , and the effective volume probed by the data . there are multiple classes of lower- sources that may have similar colors to lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , such as galactic stars , intermediate - redshift passive galaxies , and strong line emitters . cool , red stars in the milky way may be possible contaminants of our sample , although typical colors lack a strong drop . at low signal - to - noise ratio , the separation of point - like galactic stars from resolved galaxies using the ` sextractor ` class star parameter is not fully reliable . we use class star in our selection of -dropouts in section to reject artifacts remaining from the reduction process , but this is not a strict enough criterion to reject all stars from our sample . in this case , five of our candidates identified as -dropouts have class star , with only borg 1459 + 7146 785 having class star ( a value considered by as indicative of a stellar nature ) . therefore we conclude that this source is most likely a stellar contaminant with unusual colors . emission - line galaxies are another source of contamination for galaxy samples . for example , galaxies at with strong emission may appear bright in -band while the galaxy continuum is too faint to be detected in the other bands . find that , at , the average density of extreme line emitters that enter the photometric selection is per arcmin , by creating mock catalogs of extreme emission line galaxies with varying magnitude and spectral slope . extrapolating this result to , we expect to find potential contaminants of this type over our survey area . this value is in line with previous spectroscopic observations of borg candidates by using the mosfire spectrograph on the keck telescope , and by using xshooter on the very large telescope . these studies found no emission lines in the spectroscopy of candidates , and are able to rule out emission lines from a low- extreme emission line contaminant to , assuming that all of the flux is due to a strong emission line . also find that , with a 3hr exposure , only a small part of the spectrum  is so affected by atmospheric transmission and absorption by oh lines that a strong emission line would not be detected to . the last , and probably most severe class of contaminants , is that of passive and dusty galaxies that thus show a strong balmer break and a very faint uv continuum . under these conditions , sources may mimic properties of lbgs and thus enter into our selection . observations with spitzer /irac at and m can efficiently distinguish between high- and low - redshift sources . in fact , dusty galaxies will appear 1 - 2 magnitudes brighter in and than in , while lbgs will have a relatively flat spectrum . without spitzer data , we rely on the size of the sources as proxy for the $ ] color , considering sources with as likely contaminants . find that , while the mean size of candidates in the sample from is , low - redshift , irac - red interlopers have a mean size of , but can be as small as , and there are no high- candidates with sizes greater than ( figure 4 , ) . hence , we take as a threshold . the two brightest sources in our sample are so extended to fall into such classification . the sources considered in are fainter than the candidates in our sample , and so it is conceivable that the larger sizes of borg 0240 - 1857 129 and borg 0240 - 1857 369 are due to their higher luminosities . using the size - luminosity relation derived in , we infer that the size of a galaxy at ( the brightest in our sample ) would be , below our threshold of . this size can not be used to completely reject extreme emission - line galaxies , which are likely to be more compact . for example , find that their sample of 52 extreme emission line galaxies in clash have fwhm , similar to our criterion for candidates . in addition to finding the redshift probability distribution of our six candidates using bpz , we also fit sed templates described in . from this , we find an average probability of . we conclude that three out of the six candidates , borg 1459 + 7146 785 , borg 0240 - 1857 129 , and borg 0240 - 1857 369 , are likely to be contaminants . for the remaining three , contamination is still a possibility , and hence we make a conservative assumption of contamination ( two out of three sources at ) , based on the estimate from the borg survey using the average probability for the candidates in their sample . of the six possible candidates identified in the full borg survey , three of them , including the two brightest , are found in the same field ( borg 0240 - 1857 ) . the exposure time for this pointing is similar to the median of the survey ( s in ) , and thus such a catch is highly unlikely under the assumptions of a uniform distribution of candidates in the 62 fields analyzed here . based on theoretical expectations , the presence of clustering can be used to verify the identity of bright high- sources , under the broad assumption that uv luminosity is correlated with dark - matter halo mass ( e.g. , ) . overdensities have also been identified at in lbg samples . however , one alternative possibility , more consistent with the relatively large size of the two bright -dropouts , would be the presence of an overdensity of passive and dusty satellite galaxies within an intermediate redshift group . in either case , a further exploration of this configuration is very interesting since it can either identify an exciting overdensity of unexpectedly bright sources at , or shed light on the properties of intermediate redshift galaxies with extreme colors . we perform source recovery simulations to determine the efficiency and completeness of our selection , following . to do this , we insert and recover artificial galaxies with a srsic luminosity profile in the images . half of the sources follow a de vaucouleurs profile ( srsic index ) , and the other half follow an exponential profile ( srsic index ) , spanning a range of magnitudes  , redshifts  and sizes ( logarithmic distribution with mean 0175 at , scaling as ) . the spectra of the sources are modeled as power law with ( gaussian distribution ) with a sharp cut - off at rest - frame . the intrinsic profiles of the artificial sources are convolved with the wfc3 psf for each corresponding filter , before being inserted into the borg science images at random positions . sources are then identified with , and the statistics of the recovery rate is quantified . this is through the definition of which is the completeness of the source detection , that is the probability of recovering an artificial source of magnitude in the image , and of , which is the probability of identifying an artificial source of magnitude and redshift within the dropout sample , assuming that the source is detected . one example of the selection function for the dropout search in field borg 0440 - 5244 is shown in the bottom panel of figure , while the upper panel of the same figure shows the overall effective volume probed by our search over all borg archival fields as a function of the apparent magnitude . + recovered from simulations , as a function of the apparent magnitude . bottom panel : an example of the selection function for field borg 0440 - 5244 . the selection function is derived from simulations , by inserting and recovering artificial sources . ,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ] from the discussion in section , we consider the two brightest sources to be likely contaminants because of their large half - light radii , and we exclude the point - like source borg 1459 + 7146 785 as well . for the surviving three candidates we assume a contamination rate of , e.g. we expect two sources to be at . after taking into account the effective volume probed by our selection , our estimates for the bright - end of the luminosity function at is reported in table , and shown in figure . interestingly , we infer a higher number density of bright sources than previous determinations by around , although the uncertainty is very large because of the small number of candidates . for brighter sources  , our upper limits on density are similar to those obtained in legacy fields , and strengthen the evidence for suppression of the abundance of galaxies at the bright - end of the luminosity function . when compared to the initial results from the ongoing borg survey , assuming that our two brightest sources are low - redshift contaminants , we do not find evidence of ultra - bright  galaxies despite analyzing data covering more than twice the area . if follow - up observations of our brightest sources indicate that they are likely at high redshift , we would instead determine that the lf is higher at the bright end than the upper limit from , and is instead consistent with the determination by at . overall , our lf determination is higher , but still consistent at with the theoretical model of , shown as grey shaded area in figure . previous studies did not attempt unconstrained fits to the lf , likely because of the small number of candidates . to evaluate the status of the situation with our additional datapoints , we attempt to derive schechter parameters for a maximum likelihood fit to the stepwise lf data , carried out assuming a poisson distribution for the number of galaxies expected in each bin ( see ) . due to the non - detection at by , the lf is suppressed at the faint end . this leads to a likelihood landscape that is very flat over a wide region of the parameter space , and hence , we are unable to sufficiently constrain the schechter parameters . our fit attempt thus highlights that the dataset is still too small for tight quantitative constraints , but future growth in the number of candidates identified will allow rapid improvements . finally , we note that our conclusions rest on the assumption that the two brightest candidates we identified in field borg 0240 - 1857 are contaminants . if we were to include them in the analysis as sources , we would infer that the lf would favor a power law at the bright end , rather than a schechter form . evidence for a single or double power - law form at high redshift has been seen in determinations of the lf at ( , also earlier considered by ) , and potentially at by , and may be naturally interpreted as a decrease in mass quenching from processes such as agn feedback at high redshift . magnification bias , however , can also produce this effect on an otherwise schechter - like lf . thus , the astrophysical interpretation of our search ultimately rests on follow - up observations to establish the nature of the candidates borg 0240 - 1857 129 and borg 0240 - 1857 369 . in any case , it is very interesting to note that the number of potential candidate -dropouts that we identified is small ( just six in over 60 fields ) , making further observations time - efficient , especially because half of the sources are clustered in a single pointing . cc & + & + & in this paper we presented a search for candidates in archival data of the 2010 - 2014 brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) survey , a pure - parallel optical and near - infrared survey using hst /wfc3 . while the survey was optimized to identify sources as -dropouts , we searched over the deepest 293 arcmin of the survey for -dropout sources with , motivated by recent identification of very bright sources with . our key results are : * we identify six galaxy candidates , detected in at s / n and satisfying a conservative color selection with non - detection in bluer bands of the survey . the candidate s magnitudes vary from to . analysis of the surface brightness profile leads to the tentative identification of three contaminants , with the two brightest sources likely being intermediate redshift passive galaxies due to their size , and one faint source a galactic cool dwarf star because of the compact size and high stellarity . * of the six candidates , three are in the same field , borg 0240 - 1857 , including the two brightest of the sample . such strong clustering would be naturally explained if the sources were ( see ) , despite contrary indication from , but an alternative explanation of sub - halo clustering at intermediate redshift would also be viable . * based on our best estimate of the lf , we infer a higher galaxy number density for sources at compared to the observations of bouwens et al . ( 2015a , b ) and with the theoretical model of mason et al . ( 2015b ) . however , our measurement is still consistent at the level with these studies . * irrespective of the nature of the two brightest sources in the sample , the selection criteria that we adopted yield a small number of candidates , very manageable for follow - up observations . this is quite remarkable , since the borg survey was not designed with in mind , and the number of contaminants could have been much larger given the absence of a second detection band and the lack of a near - uv color to help remove passive and dusty intermediate redshift galaxies . * targeted follow - up observations can efficiently clarify the nature of the candidates we identified , help to further constrain the bright - end of the lf and characterize the properties of the yet unstudied population of compact intermediate redshift passive galaxies that mimic the colors of sources . the efficiency of targeted follow - ups and the overall potential to complement searches for sources traditionally carried out in legacy fields are demonstrated by the very recent award of spitzer irac time to our team to investigate the nature of the sources discussed here ( pid # 12058 , pi bouwens ) . with these observations , it will be possible to clarify the behavior of the bright end of the lf at , as well as to confirm ideal targets for further spectroscopic follow - up investigations without having to wait for james webb space telescope . sb , mt , and jw thank the vatican observatory , where part of this work was carried out , for kind hospitality . this work was partially supported by grants hst /go 13767 , 12905 , and 12572 . this research was conducted by the australian research council centre of excellence for all -

{"article": "invariants are a popular concept in object recognition and image retrieval . they aim to provide descriptions that remain constant under certain geometric or radiometric transformations of the scene , thereby reducing the search space . they can be classified into global invariants , typically based either on a set of key points or on moments , and local invariants , typically based on derivatives of the image function which is assumed to be continuous and differentiable . the geometric transformations of interest often include translation , rotation , and scaling , summarily referred to as similarity transformations . in a previous paper , building on work done by schmid and mohr , we have proposed differential invariants for those similarity transformations , plus linear brightness change . here , we are looking at a non - linear brightness change known as gamma correction . gamma correction is a non - linear quantization of the brightness measurements performed by many cameras during the image formation process . the idea is to achieve better perceptual results by maintaining an approximately constant ratio between adjacent brightness levels , placing the quantization levels apart by the just noticeable difference . incidentally , this non - linear quantization also precompensates for the non - linear mapping from voltage to brightness in electronic display devices . gamma correction can be expressed by the equation where is the input intensity , is the output intensity , and is a normalization factor which is determined by the value of . for output devices , the ntsc standard specifies . for input devices like cameras , the parameter value is just inversed , resulting in a typical value of . the camera we used , the sony 3 ccd color camera dxc 950 , exhibited . for the kodak megaplus xrc camera ] shows the intensity mapping of 8-bit data for different values of . it turns out that an invariant under gamma correction can be designed from first and second order derivatives . additional invariance under scaling requires third order derivatives . derivatives are by nature translationally invariant . rotational invariance in 2-d is achieved by using rotationally symmetric operators . the key idea for the design of the proposed invariants is to form suitable ratios of the derivatives of the image function such that the parameters describing the transformation of interest will cancel out . this idea has been used in to achieve invariance under linear brightness changes , and it can be adjusted to the context of gamma correction by at least conceptually considering the logarithm of the image function . for simplicity , we begin with 1-d image functions . let be the image function , i.e. the original signal , assumed to be continuous and differentiable , and the corresponding gamma corrected function . note that is a special case of where . taking the logarithm yields with the derivatives , and . we can now define the invariant under gamma correction to be {0mm}{13 mm } & = \\\\ & = \\ ] ] the factor has been eliminated by taking derivatives , and has canceled out . furthermore , turns out to be completely specified in terms of the original image function and its derivatives , i.e. the logarithm actually does nt have to be computed . the notation indicates that the invariant depends on the underlying image function and location the invariance holds under gamma correction , not under spatial changes of the image function . a shortcoming of is that it is undefined where the denominator is zero . therefore , we modify to be continuous everywhere : {0mm}{8 mm } { \\normalsize } & & { \\normalsize if } \\\\ & & { \\normalsize else } \\\\ \\ ] ] where , for notational convenience , we have dropped the variable . the modification entails . note that the modification is just a heuristic to deal with poles . if all derivatives are zero because the image function is constant , then differentials are certainly not the best way to represent the function . if scaling is a transformation that has to be considered , then another parameter describing the change of size has to be introduced . that is , scaling is modeled here as variable substitution : the scaled version of is . so we are looking at the function where the derivatives with respect to are , , and . now the invariant is obtained by defining a suitable ratio of the derivatives such that both and cancel out : {0mm}{10 mm } & = \\ ] ] analogously to eq .  , we can define a modified invariant {0mm}{8 mm } { \\normalsize } & & { \\normalsize if cond2 } \\\\ & & { \\normalsize else } \\\\ \\ ] ] where condition cond1 is , and condition cond2 is . again , this modification entails . it is a straightforward albeit cumbersome exercise to verify the invariants from eqs .  and  with an analytical , differentiable function . as an arbitrary example , we choose the first three derivatives are , , and . then , according to eq .  , . if we now replace with a gamma corrected version , say , the first derivative becomes , the second derivative is , and the third is . if we plug these derivatives into eq .  , we obtain an expression for which is identical to the one for above . the algebraically inclined reader is encouraged to verify the invariant for the same function . shows the example function and its gamma corrected counterpart , together with their derivatives and the two modified invariants . as expected , the graphs of the invariants are the same on the right as on the left . note that the invariants define a many - to - one mapping . that is , the mapping is not information preserving , and it is not possible to reconstruct the original image from its invariant representation . if or are to be computed on images , then eqs .  to  have to be generalized to two dimensions . this is to be done in a rotationally invariant way in order to achieve invariance under similarity transformations . the standard way is to use rotationally symmetric operators . for the first derivative , we have the well known gradient magnitude , defined as where is the 2-d image function , and , are partial derivatives along the x - axis and the y - axis . for the second order derivative , we can use the linear laplacian horn also presents an alternative second order derivative operator , the quadratic variation since the qv is not a linear operator and more expensive to compute , we use the laplacian for our implementation . for the third order derivative , we can define , in close analogy with the quadratic variation , a cubic variation as the invariants from eqs .  to  remain valid in 2-d if we replace with , with , and with . this can be verified by going through the same argument as for the functions . recall that the critical observation in eq .  was that cancels out , which is the case when all derivatives return a factor . but such is also the case with the rotationally symmetric operators mentioned above . for example , if we apply the gradient magnitude operator to , i.e. to the logarithm of a gamma corrected image function , we obtain returning a factor , and analogously for , qv , and cv . a similar argument holds for eq .  where we have to show , in addition , that the first derivative returns a factor , the second derivative returns a factor , and the third derivative returns a factor , which is the case for our 2-d operators . while the derivatives of continuous , differentiable functions are uniquely defined , there are many ways to implement derivatives for sampled functions . we follow schmid and mohr , ter haar romeny , and many other researchers in employing the derivatives of the gaussian function as filters to compute the derivatives of a sampled image function via convolution . this way , derivation is combined with smoothing . the 2-d zero mean gaussian is defined as the partial derivatives up to third order are , , , , , , , , . they are shown in fig . . we used the parameter setting and kernel size with these kernels , eq .  , for example , is implemented as at each pixel , where denotes convolution . we evaluate the invariant from eq .  in two different ways . first , we measure how much the invariant computed on an image without gamma correction is different from the invariant computed on the same image but with gamma correction . theoretical , this difference should be zero , but in practice , it is not . second , we compare template matching accuracy on intensity images , again without and with gamma correction , to the accuracy achievable if instead the invariant representation is used . we also examine whether the results can be improved by prefiltering . a straightforward error measure is the absolute error , where `` 0gc '' refers to the image without gamma correction , and gc stands for either `` sgc '' if the gamma correction is done synthetically via eq .  , or for `` cgc '' if the gamma correction is done via the camera hardware . like the invariant itself , the absolute error is computed at each pixel location of the image , except for the image boundaries where the derivatives and therefore the invariants can not be computed reliably . shows an example image . the sgc image has been computed from the 0gc image , with . note that the gamma correction is done after the quantization of the 0gc image , since we do nt have access to the 0gc image before quantization . shows the invariant representations of the image data from fig . and the corresponding absolute errors . since , we have . the dark points in fig . , ( c ) and ( e ) , indicate areas of large errors . we observe two error sources : * the invariant can not be computed robustly in homogeneous regions . this is hardly surprising , given that it is based on differentials which are by definition only sensitive to spatial changes of the signal . * there are outliers even in the sgc invariant representation , at points of very high contrast edges . they are a byproduct of the inherent smoothing when the derivatives are computed with differentials of the gaussian . note that the latter put a ceiling on the maximum gradient magnitude that is computable on 8-bit images . in addition to computing the absolute error , we can also compute the relative error , in percent , as then we can define the set of reliable points , relative to some error threshold , as and , the percentage of reliable points , as where is the number of valid , i.e. non - boundary , pixels in the image . shows , in the first row , the reliable points for three different values of the threshold . the second row shows the sets of reliable points for the same thresholds if we gently prefilter the 0gc and cgc images . the corresponding data for the ten test images from fig . is summarized in table . derivatives are known to be sensitive to noise . noise can be reduced by smoothing the original data before the invariants are computed . on the other hand , derivatives should be computed as locally as possible . with these conflicting goals to be considered , we experiment with gentle prefiltering , using a gaussian filter of size =1.0 . the size of the gaussian to compute the invariant is set to =1.0 . note that and can not be combined into just one gaussian because of the non - linearity of the invariant . with respect to the set of reliable points , we observe that after prefiltering , roughly half the points , on average , have a relative error of less than 20% . gentle prefiltering consistently reduces both absolute and relative errors , but strong prefiltering does not . template matching is a frequently employed technique in computer vision . here , we will examine how gamma correction affects the spatial accuracy of template matching , and whether that accuracy can be improved by using the invariant . an overview of the testbed scenario is given in fig . . a small template of size , representing the search pattern , is taken from a 0gc intensity image , i.e. without gamma correction . this query template is then correlated with the corresponding cgc intensity image , i.e. the same scene but with gamma correction switched on . if the correlation maximum occurs at exactly the location where the 0gc query template has been cut out , we call this a correct maximum correlation position , or cmcp . the correlation function employed here is based on a normalized mean squared difference : where is an image , is a template positioned at , is the mean of the subimage of at of the same size as , is the mean of the template , and . the template location problem then is to perform this correlation for the whole image and to determine whether the position of the correlation maximum occurs precisely at . demonstrates the template location problem , on the left for an intensity image , and on the right for its invariant representation . the black box marks the position of the original template at ( 40,15 ) , and the white box marks the position of the matched template , which is incorrectly located at ( 50,64 ) in the intensity image . on the right , the matched template ( white ) has overwritten the original template ( black ) at the same , correctly identified position . visualizes the correlation function over the whole image . the white areas are regions of high correlation . the example from figs . and deals with only one arbitrarily selected template . in order to systematically analyze the template location problem , we repeat the correlation process for all possible template locations . then we can define the correlation accuracy ca as the percentage of correctly located templates , where is the size of the template , is the set of correct maximum correlation positions , and , again , is the number of valid pixels . we compute the correlation accuracy both for unfiltered images and for gently prefiltered images , with . shows the binary correlation accuracy matrices for our example image . the cmcp set is shown in white , its complement and the boundaries in black . we observe a higher correlation accuracy for the invariant representation , which is improved by the prefiltering . we have computed the correlation accuracy for all the images given in fig . . the results are shown in table and visualized in fig . . we observe the following : * the correlation accuracy ca is higher on the invariant representation than on the intensity images . * the correlation accuracy is higher on the invariant representation with gentle prefiltering , , than without prefiltering . we also observed a decrease in correlation accuracy if we increase the prefiltering well beyond . by contrast , prefiltering seems to be always detrimental to the intensity images ca . * the correlation accuracy shows a wide variation , roughly in the range 30%% for the unfiltered intensity images and 50%% for prefiltered invariant representations . similarly , the gain in correlation accuracy ranges from close to zero up to 45% . for our test images , it turns out that the invariant representation is always superior , but that does nt necessarily have to be the case . * the medians and means of the cas over all test images confirm the gain in correlation accuracy for the invariant representation . * the larger the template size , the higher the correlation accuracy , independent of the representation . a larger template size means more structure , and more discriminatory power . we have proposed novel invariants that combine invariance under gamma correction with invariance under geometric transformations . in a general sense , the invariants can be seen as trading off derivatives for a power law parameter , which makes them interesting for applications beyond image processing . the error analysis of our implementation on real images has shown that , for sampled data , the invariants can not be computed robustly everywhere . nevertheless , the template matching application scenario has demonstrated that a performance gain is achievable by using the proposed invariant . bob woodham suggested to the author to look into invariance under gamma correction . his meticulous comments on this work were much appreciated . jochen lang helped with the acquisition of image data through the acme facility .

{"article": "it is believed that solar magnetic fields are created in the tachocline , the interface between the convection zone and the radiative interior . due to buoyancy instabilities , they move upward and emerge into the solar atmosphere in the form of -shaped flux tubes . the largest emerging active regions produce sunspots with magnetic fluxes in excess of mx and lifetimes of several weeks to months . smaller active regions consist of pores and contain an order of magnitude less flux , persisting over days to weeks . the smallest emerging regions detected to date are the so - called ephemeral regions . they have fluxes between and mx and lifetimes in the range from hours to days ( e. g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . outside of active regions , the quiet sun has proved to be full of magnetic fields with strengths roughly in equipartition with the photospheric convective flows . an important question is the origin of these fields . suggested that horizontal internetwork fields represent concentrated loops of flux carried to the surface by the upflows of granular convection or by magnetic buoyancy . in a recent paper , indirectly traced the emergence of magnetic flux and reconstructed , for the first time , the three dimensional topology of the magnetic field vector in quiet regions of the solar photosphere . it was found that at least 20% of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun is connected by low - lying magnetic loops . later , studied time series of spectropolarimetric observations taken with the solar optical telescope aboard hinode . these authors followed the time evolution of one magnetic loop in the internetwork , showing that they appear on spatial scales smaller than 2 . and demonstrated that the emergence of magnetic flux on granular scales brings large amounts of horizontal fields to the photosphere both in plage regions and in the quiet sun . another form of flux emergence has been reported by . it involves the appearance and subsequent disappearance of what seem to be vertical fields at the center of granular cells . the observations strongly suggest that a significant fraction of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun might be the result of the emergence of small - scale magnetic loops . but , where do the loops come from ? are they created by the global solar dynamo , by a local dynamo , or by recycling of flux from decaying active regions ? is the emergence process a local phenomenon confined to the photosphere or does the magnetic flux reach higher atmospheric layers ? the answers to these questions bear important consequences for our understanding of the magnetic and thermal structure of the solar atmosphere . for example , claim that the magnetic energy stored in the quiet photosphere is sufficient to balance the radiative losses of the chromosphere . quiet sun magnetic fields are excellent candidates to solve the chromospheric and coronal heating problem , but a mechanism capable of transferring their energy to the upper layers has not been identified yet . from a theoretical point of view , it is not clear whether the fields of the quiet solar photosphere can rise to the chromosphere . have presented mhd simulations in which the magnetic field emerges into the photosphere in the form of small - scale -loops . they reach the chromosphere and get reconnected with the local expanding vertical magnetic fields , heating the plasma and generating high frequency mhd waves that propagate into the corona . however , the magnetoconvection simulations of show -loops that disintegrate as they rise through the solar atmosphere . these discrepancies emphasize the need for observational studies aimed at determining whether magnetic fields emerging into the quiet photosphere are able to reach higher atmospheric layers . here we use multi - wavelength observations taken by hinode and the dutch open telescope to address this question . we also characterize the physical properties of small - scale magnetic loops in the quiet sun , providing estimates of their magnetic fluxes , emergence rates , lifetimes , sizes , and velocities . the data analyzed in this paper consist of time series of polarimetric and imaging observations of quiet sun regions at disk center . they were acquired in seven different days ( 25 - 29 september , 1 and 6 october 2007 ) using the instruments of the solar optical telescope aboard hinode and the dutch open telescope ( dot ; * ? ? ? * ) at observatorio de el roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) . the observations belong to the hinode operation plan 14 , entitled `` hinode / canary islands campaign '' . the hinode spectro - polarimeter ( sp ; * ? ? ? * ) recorded the full stokes vector of the pair of lines at 630 nm in a narrow field of view ( fov ) of . this region was scanned with a cadence of 28 s during 2 - 6 hours per day ( table ) . the exposure time per slit position was set to 1.6 s to track very rapid events . however , this mode of operation also led to a noise level of in units of the continuum intensity . with a pixel size of along the slit and perpendicular to it , the sp measurements have a spatial resolution of about . the hinode narrowband filter imager ( nfi ; tsuneta et al . 2008 ) acquired stokes i and v filtergrams in the wings of the chromospheric mg i b 517.3 nm line , pm away from its center . the nfi was operated in shutterless mode to reach an effective exposure time of 9.6 s per wavelength and polarization state , covering a fov of . the original filtergrams had a pixel size of 0.08 , but we rebined them to the sp pixel size in order to further reduce the noise . the hinode broadband filter imager ( bfi ; * ? ? ? * ) acquired simultaneous images of the photosphere in the cn bandhead at 388.3 nm ( filter width of 0.52 nm ) and the chromosphere in the caiih line at 396.85 nm ( filter width of 0.22 nm ) . the exposure times were 0.1 s and 0.3 s , respectively . the bfi covered a region of with a pixel size of . both the nfi and the bfi took images with a cadence of 30 s. the area scanned by the sp represents a small part of the total fov of the nfi and the bfi . therefore , we have cospatial and cotemporal observations of the quiet sun tracing different heights in the atmosphere . the dot observed photospheric and chromospheric layers by means of a tunable lyot filter that scanned the intensity profile of the h line at five wavelength positions ( , , and 0 ) . the passband of the filter was 0.25 . speckle bursts of 100 frames were taken at each wavelength position every 30 s. following the standard reduction procedure at the dot , the individual filtergrams were reconstructed using a speckle masking technique ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . the reconstructed images cover a fov of and have a spatial resolution of about 0.2 . the dot and hinode carried out simultaneous observations , but there is little overlap between them because of bad weather conditions . the sp data have been corrected for dark current , flat - field , and instrumental cross - talk using the sp prep.pro routine included in the solarsoft package . the algorithm applied to the hinode filtergrams ( fg prep.pro ) removed dark current , hot pixels , and cosmic rays . the spectropolarimetric maps and the various filtergrams have been aligned with pixel accuracy using the granulation , g - band bright points , and network elements as a reference . in fig . we show time - averaged h filtergrams and b magnetograms for the seven days of observation . the h images have been trimmed to the size of the b fov . the rectangles represent the areas scanned by the sp . note the absence of strong brigthenings in the h maps , as expected for very quiet regions largely devoid of network elements . + ccccc date & 1st period & 2nd period & observed & detected + & ( ut ) & ( ut ) & time & loops + 25 sep & 13:00 - 15:59 & & 3.0 h & 18 + 26 sep & 08:15 - 14:14 &

polarity . one of the main goals of this paper is to trace the possible ascent of small - scale magnetic loops through the solar atmosphere . to this end , we use photospheric and chromospheric observables . the sp data make it possible to investigate the topology of the field in the photosphere . the information is complemented by the cn filtergrams , where bright points associated with magnetic fields are easily visible . we define the total circular polarization as the integral of the unsigned stokes spectrum . the integration is carried out in the wavelength range from pm to pm . the total linear polarization is computed as the integral of the stokes profile of 603.25 nm , using the same initial and final wavelengths . we visually inspect the polarization maps to search for weak linear signals between two patches of circular polarization with opposite polarity . since in general the linear polarization signals are very small in the quiet sun , we ascribe those cases to loop - like structures only after corroborating that the linear polarization is produced by symmetric stokes and profiles . figure shows the first stages of the emergence of a small - scale magnetic loop as seen in the 630.25 nm line . the different panels represent continuum intensity ( top ) , total linear polarization ( middle ) , and total circular polarization ( bottom ) . red contours indicate enhanced linear polarization . black and white contours mark the location of strong negative and positive circular signals . at s , a patch of linear polarization shows up at the center of the image . it corresponds to the horizontal part of a magnetic structure emerging into the photosphere . between and 60 s , two circular polarization patches of opposite polarity appear next to it , at the edge of a granular cell . the fact that the linear signal is detected earlier than the circular polarization indicates that the magnetic structure has the shape of an -loop : the apex creates linear polarization and the vertical fields of the footpoints give rise to circular polarization . the linear polarization disappears below the noise at s while the footpoints separate with time . this sequence of events is consistent with a loop that emerges and travels up in the atmosphere . the distance between the footpoints keeps increasing until they reach the edges of the area scanned by the sp . the subsequent evolution of this loop will be studied in . the stokes and filtergrams acquired in the red and blue wings of the b line give information about the upper photosphere / temperature minimum region . we have used them to construct longitudinal magnetograms  and dopplergrams  as where the subscripts r and b represent the measurements at and pm from line center , respectively . to first order , the magnetograms computed in this way are not affected by mass motions . the quantities and have been transformed into magnetic flux densities and line - of - sight velocities according to with in mx cm and in km s . equation is valid in the range km s . these expresions have been obtained through calibration of the b line shape in the fourier transform spectrometer atlas of the quiet sun and give only rough estimates of the magnetic flux density and velocity at the height of formation of the b measurements . since stokes q and u were not recorded , the mg i magnetograms can only be used to detect relatively vertical fields such as those expected at the footpoints of magnetic loops . by definition , fields pointing towards the observer and upflows will both be positive . note that our sign convention for the velocity differs from that commonly used in astrophysics . in the chromosphere we do not have polarimetric information . however , magnetic fields can be detected through brightness enhancements in the h filtergrams . the passband of the hinode h filter includes a significant photospheric contribution , but it has a long tail that extends well into the chromosphere . finally , information on the upper chromosphere is provided by the h measurements taken at the dot . we have used them to construct dopplergrams at different heights in the chromosphere . we determine the magnetic flux density from the stokes profiles of the 630 nm lines using the weak field approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) where is the longitudinal flux density , the filling factor , the field strength , the inclination of the field with respect to the vertical , a proportionality constant that depends on the central wavelength and the effective land factor of the transition , and represents the intensity profile . the units of are mx cm when is expressed in . the longitudinal flux density is obtained from a least - squares minimization of the form }{\\partial \\phi}=0 , {\\partial \\phi}\\left=0 , \\ ] ] which uses all the wavelength samples across the profile ( index ) and is therefore more accurate that determinations based on single magnetogram measurements . this calculation is repeated for each pixel and each spectral line separately . the final result is to estimate the uncertainty caused by photon noise we simulated a data set containing only gaussian noise with a standard deviation of . the analysis of this data set using eq . leads to a gaussian - shaped histogram for the magnetic flux density which is centered at 0 and has a standard deviation of mx cm . in figure we check the assumption made on the zeeman regime . the plot shows an histogram of the ratio between the magnetic flux densities derived from 630.15 and 630.25 nm . only the stokes v spectra at the footpoints of the loops having amplitudes above 5 times the noise level have been considered . as can be seen , the histogram is narrow and peaks at 1 . the figure also shows a scatter plot of the magnetic flux densities obtained with the two lines . the fact that most of the points are located near the diagonal implies that in the majority of cases both spectral lines measure the same magnetic flux . this strongly supports the idea that the fields are weak . during 28 hours of observations we have detected the appearance of 69 loop - like structures in the region scanned with the hinode spectropolarimeter . table summarizes their properties . the observed loops followed very similar evolution patterns . in this section we describe specific cases to illustrate the emergence process , distinguishing between loops that rise to the chromosphere and loops that remain low - lying . one of the clearest examples of a loop that reached the chromosphere was loop ml09 , observed on september 25 , 2007 at 14:39 ut . its evolution is summarized in figs . and . each row represents a time step , for a total of 1020 s. from left to right we show cn filtergrams , photospheric los velocities derived from the stokes zero - crossing shifts of 630.25 nm , total circular polarization maps in 632.05 nm , magnetic flux densities computed from b 517.3 nm , los velocities at the height of formation of the b line , and h line - core filtergrams . positive velocities indicate upflows . note that the time steps are not evenly spaced ; rather , we have adjusted them to better describe the various phases of the process . the red contours mark regions of large linear polarization signals in 630.25 nm . when the footpoints of the loop are visible in the photosphere , we plot contours of 630.25 nm circular polarization in black and white for the negative and positive signals , respectively . when the footpoints are only visible in the b magnetogram we plot them in blue and turquoise . the first row of fig . shows the emergence of linear polarization above a granule ( cf . the white arrow in the cn filtergram ) . it is caused by the horizontal part of the loop reaching the photosphere . the footpoints are not yet visible but will appear 30 s later , very close to the patch of linear polarization . at the loop is completely formed . it emerges in a granular region , perhaps because the upward granular motions help the field lines to rise from below the solar surface . the los velocity maps show photospheric upflows at the position of the footpoints , confirming that the loop is rising . for the moment , however , the magnetic field remains in the lower photosphere : we do not observe circular polarization signals in the b magnetograms or brightenings in caiih that could be associated with the loop . interestingly , the strong photospheric network element with negative polarity located towards the bottom of the scan , at a height of about one fourth of the displayed fov , is well observed both in the b magnetograms and the ca filtergrams , and will remain so during most of the time sequence . this nicely illustrates the capabilities of our observations : magnetic structures that are visible in the polarization maps but not in b or h are intrinsically lower in the solar atmosphere . between s and s the linear polarization signals disappear below the noise . the positive footpoint has drifted to an intergranular lane and is concentrated , whereas the negative footpoint continues to be rooted in the granule and is more diffuse . the distance between them increases steadily . we still see upward motions in the photospheric velocity maps . since the loop is moving to higher layers , it is reasonable to conclude that the linear polarization disappears because the apex of the loop leaves the formation region of the 630 nm lines . however , no traces of the loop are detected yet in b or h. at s , weak circular polarization signals cospatial with the photospheric footpoints are observed in the b magnetograms for the first time . this indicates that the loop has reached the upper photospheric / lower chromospheric layers where the central part of the b line forms . interestingly , the b dopplergram exhibits downflows of about km s at the position of the positive footpoint . the downflows could represent plasma moving along the legs of the loop as the whole structure reaches high atmospheric layers . these motions may be essential for the loop to get rid of part of its mass before it can emerge into a less dense medium . at s , the loop is nearly out of the region scanned by the sp . the signals in the b magnetogram are much more intense and correspond to footpoints rooted in intergranular lanes . from now on the distance between the footpoints will increase , but at a slower rate than when they were crossing granular structures . this inflection point can be seen in fig . , where we plot the footpoint separation as a function of time . the distance is computed only when the two footpoints are visible , both in the maps ( squares ) and in the b magnetograms ( triangles ) . in the first 500 s of the loop evolution , the distance between the footpoints increases linearly at a rate of 5.9 km s . therefore , the mean velocity of the footpoints is 2.95 km s , a value compatible with the motion of the granular plasma . the linear increase of the separation with time is a common feature of the loops and indicates that they do not undergo a free random walk ( otherwise the distance would increase as the square root of time ) . towards the end of the loop evolution the separation rate slows down , coinciding with the arrival of the footpoints to intergranular lanes . summarizing , the loop emerges in a granule and the horizontal granular motions drive the magnetic field lines to the closest intergranular space , where strong downdrafts capture and stabilize them . when this happens , the separation between the footpoints is about 4000 km . at s , the footpoints are clearly visible in the b magnetogram and exhibit downflows in the b dopplergram . the whole structure is rising because the footpoints continue to separate . however , no brightenings are detected in the h filtergrams . we mention in passing that a new loop appear in the fov at this time , very close to the site of emergence of the structure we are describing in detail . they show a linear polarization signal in between opposite polarities , which makes it easy to identify . at s , the loop has reached the chromosphere since we observe two h brightenings associated with the footpoints ( in fig . , the contours have been substituted by arrows for clarity ) . the legs of the loop still show downflows in the b dopplergrams and , for the first time , bright points are observed in the cn images at the position of the footpoints . the last panels of fig . displays the beginning of the loop decay . the positive footpoint is very weak , although it still shows downflows at the height of formation of the b measurements . it will disappear below the noise level , together with the downdrafts , at the end of the sequence . the negative footpoint is approaching a negative polarity patch with whom it will eventually mix . the negative footpoint shows downflows and is associated with a bright point in h. these features will survive the disappearance of the footpoint thanks to the interaction with the network element . in this section we present a typical example of a loop which do not show chromospheric signatures and thus remain low - lying . figure shows all the data available for this loop ( ml23 ) , arranged as in fig . . in the first frame , a patch of linear polarization is observed to emerge at the border of a granule ( see the white arrow ) . the footpoints can already be detected in the intergranular lane , but they are very weak . at this time the photospheric velocity map exhibits a patch of upflows at the position of the loop , confirming its rise through the solar atmosphere . at s the loop reaches its largest extent ( 520 km ) while the upflows start to weaken . the linear polarization and the upward plasma motions are almost gone by s. in the next frame , at s , the loop is no longer seen . the evolution of the loop is so rapid that it appears and disappears almost at the same place . interestingly , the footpoints never approach each other . this rules out submergence below the solar surface as the cause of the loop disappearance . all the loops that stay in the photosphere show very similar behaviors . in general , the evolve very quickly , disappearing not far from the region where they emerged . none of these loops exhibit downflows in the b line or brightenings in the cn or ca filtergrams . in the previous section we have seen that small - scale magnetic loops in the quiet sun may rise through the atmosphere and reach the layers where the central part of the b 517.3 nm line is formed . some of them also produce h brightness enhancements . in this context , the question naturally arises as to the maximum height that these structures can attain . are they able to reach the upper chromosphere or even the corona ? here we use the h observations of the dot to provide a partial answer to this question . unfortunately , there is little overlap between the hinode and dot measurements because of bad seeing conditions . nevertheless , for one of the loops detected by there is simultaneous coverage from the dot . we use these data to attempt to observe the rise of the loop to the upper chromosphere . the analysis is not complete and must be refined with euv and x - ray observations tailored to the detection of such magnetic structures in the hot corona . the loop observed simultaneously by hinode and the dot ( ml20 ) appeared on september 26 , 2007 , at 09:06 ut . in fig . we show its evolution in the photosphere / temperature minimum region using the 630.25 nm circular polarization maps and the b magnetograms ( first and second columns , respectively ) . the figure also displays h line core filtergrams , as well as h dopplergrams at and from line center . if the loop reaches the layers where h is formed , it should first appear in the fifth column , then in the fourth , and finally in the third . the loop emerged as a small patch of linear polarization at the border of a granule ( s , not shown ) . its subsequent evolution is similar to that of the loop considered in fig . . the footpoints of the loop are detected in the photosphere for the first time at s. the whole structure shows upflows in the stokes v zero - crossing maps , indicating its ascent . unfortunately , the negative footpoint is close to the border of the fov scanned by the sp and soon disappears from the photospheric maps . the loop becomes visible in the b magnetograms at s. at this time there is clear signal in the negative footpoint and weaker polarization in the positive leg . at s both footpoints show stronger magnetogram signals but the distance between them has not increased . the ascent of the loop to the chromosphere is associated with downflows in the b dopplergram and brightenings in the caiih line - core images . the and b signals start to fade at s until the loop disappears simultaneously from the low and the upper photospheric layers . the h line core images and the dopplergrams do not show any particular feature that could be associated with the appearence of an arch filament system in the chromosphere . it is important to remark that the maximum separation between the footpoints of this loop was only 760 km . it may well be that a larger separation is required for the apex of the loop to reach the upper chromosphere . in fact , excessive magnetic tension might prevent the field lines from rising . keeping in mind these considerations , we do not discard that magnetic loops with larger separations may be seen in future h observations . in this section we characterize the physical properties of the small - scale magnetic loops observed with weak examples and loops appearing close to strong network elements or in crowded areas are omitted from the analysis to maintain the quality of the results . this leaves us with 33 loops , which represents 48% of the total sample . table lists the basic parameters of the loops , including lifetimes  , maximum distances between footpoints  , speeds at which the footpoints separate initially  , total magnetic fluxes  and maximum flux densities  in the photosphere , estimations of maximum magnetic flux densities at the height of formation of the b measurements  , and an estimation of the largest downflows detected in the b dopplergrams  . the lifetime is the time elapsed between the appearance and disappearance of the polarization signals . when two numbers are given , the first indicates the time passed until one of the footpoints interacts with a neighboring magnetic element . the second is the time of disappearance proper ; if it is accompanied by an asterisk , then the polarization signatures of the loop were still visible at the end of the observations . to compute the total magnetic flux we define the footpoints as those regions where the flux density is larger than at the position of the loop . the value of reported in table is the maximum flux detected in one of the footpoints during the loop evolution , and the error indicates the uncertainty in caused by photon noise . the last four columns of table give the time intervals between the appearance of the loops in the photosphere and their detection in the b magnetograms , the b dopplergrams , the h line core images , and the cn filtergrams . we consider that a loop is present in any of these maps when at least one of the footpoints shows up clearly . the two numbers in each column correspond to the positive footpoint ( left ) and the negative one ( right ) . cccccccccccccc name & date & t & t & d & & & & & & t & t & t & t + & ( 09/07 ) & ( ut ) & ( s ) & ( km ) & ( km /

range of loop parameters . the lifetimes vary from some 2 min up to 40 min , although most of the loops disappear in less than 10 minutes . the maximum separation between the footpoints is a strong function of the lifetime and ranges from km to 4000 km . many loops reach horizontal dimensions comparable to , or larger than , those of granules . therefore , they must be viewed as coherent structures capable of withstanding the conditions of the granular environment for a relatively long time . the initial velocity of separation between the footpoints does not seem to have any relationship with the other parameters listed in the table . values of 0.1 to 6 km s are typical . as already mentioned , the separation speed tends to decrease when the footpoints reach the intergranular space , likely because horizontal motions there are not as vigorous as in the interior of granular cells . the longitudinal magnetic fluxes measured in the footpoints range from to mx at the level of formation of the 630 nm lines mx , considerably larger than the rest of values . this might be an artifact caused by the difficult separation of ml24 and the strong network element with which it interacts . ] . therefore , the loops have smaller fluxes than ephemeral regions and should be placed at the lower end of the flux distribution observed in emerging active regions . the magnetic flux density in the footpoints is typically 2040 mx cm . to infer the magnetic field strength from the magnetic flux density values we need to know the filling factor of the field lines that build the loop structure and their inclination . the footpoints should be relatively vertical because of geometrical reasons . assuming that the fields occupy most of the resolution element , i.e. , that the magnetic filling factor is close to unity the field strength of the loops can be estimated to be of order 10 - 100 g. only if the filling factor is much smaller than unity would the field strength increase to kg values , but we consider this possibility unlikely in view of fig . . an important result is that 23% of the loops are detected in the b magnetograms after their appearance in the photosphere ( 16 cases out of 69 ) . it takes an average of 5 minutes for the loops to move from the photosphere to the height at which the b measurements form , although faster and slower ascents have been observed too . all the loops detected in the b magnetograms develop downflows at the same heights . in addition , 15% of the loops are seen as bright points in h line - core filtergrams . this means that an important fraction of the magnetic flux that emerges into the photosphere reaches the chromosphere . as they travel upward , the loops are observed in the magnetograms , the b magnetograms , the b dopplergrams , the h line - core images , and the cn filtergrams ( in this order ) . by contrast , 77% of the loops never make it to the chromosphere . we have been unable to identify any parameter determining whether a given loop will rise or not . this includes the total magnetic flux and the magnetic flux density . however , low - lying loops tend to have lifetimes shorter than 500 s and separations smaller than 500 km . thus it may simply be that they do not last long enough to reach high atmospheric layers . further work is clearly needed to explain why a substantial fraction of the loops remain low - lying . also , the relation between these structures and the transient horizontal fields described by should be investigated , given their similar lifetimes and magnetic topologies . the observations described above demonstrate that magnetic fields do emerge into the quiet solar atmosphere in the form of small - scale loops , confirming the results of and . the loops are detected as a patch of linear polarization flanked by two circular polarization signals of opposite polarity . in nearly all the cases the linear polarization appears before or at the same time than the stokes signals , as can be expected from -shaped loops rising through the atmosphere . only in two cases out of 69 have we detected linear polarization after the loop had already disappeared . in those cases , the footpoints were approaching each other . this behavior is compatible with a loop that emerges and then submerges in the photosphere , or with a `` magnetic bubble '' , i.e. , a circle of magnetic field lines . the long duration of our time series has permitted us to discover the existence of emergence centers in which several loops appear one after the other . for example , there is a region of the solar surface where we have detected 9 events in a time interval of 1 h. the complete set of observations covering this period is provided as an mpeg animation in the electronic edition of the astrophysical journal . some of the loops even appear at the very same position . the example shown in fig . belongs to this area . the existence of emergence centers may have important consequences for the origin of the loops . these regions act as subsurface reservoirs of magnetic flux that is transferred intermittently to the photosphere by an as yet unkwnown mechanism . the loops generally emerge in granules or at their edges , although there are exceptions of loops appearing in dark areas . as the loops emerge the footpoints separate and the linear polarization fades away . in most cases , the footpoints do not describe rectilinear trajectories . figure shows the paths followed by the two polarities of the loops observed on september 25 , 2007 ( loops ml09 to ml17 in the table 2 ) . the red curves correspond to the example discussed in fig. . in this case the footpoints described quite a rectilinear path , similarly to emerging active regions and ephemeral regions . however , the majority of loops show more complicated trajectories . the reason is that , in general , they emerge in granules and drift toward the closest intergranular lane . when the footpoints reach the intergranular space they stay there and are passively advected by the flow . this creates complicated trajectories . the important point , however , is that the magnetic field is sufficiently weak as to be pushed and moved around by the granular flow , but without being destroyed in the process . the loops remain coherent during all their lifetime , as if the granular flow did not exist . during their evolution , the loops interact with other magnetic flux concentrations that cross their paths . if the loops stay long in the photosphere , the footpoints cancel with elements of opposite polarity or are absorbed by patches of the same polarity . loops that experience a fast evolution have more probabilities of avoiding other magnetic elements and often disappear without undergoing any interaction . in seeking the origin of the loops it is of interest to determine the magnetic orientation of their footpoints . if the loops are caused by the global solar dynamo , one may expect a regular ordering of the footpoints at the moment of emergence . this is what happens in active regions , where the signs of the leader and follower polarities are governed by hale s rules ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? all the loops considered here appeared in the northern hemisphere during solar cycle 23 . in that cycle , leader polarities were positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere . figure shows an histogram of the orientation of our small - scale emerging loops . the tilt angle is defined to be the angle between the solar equator and the line joining the positive footpoint with the negative one , measured from the west . the angles compatible with the orientation of sunspot polarities during solar cycle 23 in the northern hemisphere are those between 90 and 270 . even if the statistical sample is not very large , the loops seem to have nearly random orientations . thus , we conclude that they do not obey hale s polarity rules , much in the same way as the shortest - lived ephemeral regions . recent observations of hanle - sensitive lines and zeeman - sensitive lines suggest that a significant fraction of the quiet sun is occupied by magnetic fields . apparently , these fields are weak and isotropically distributed in inclination . one way to shed light on their nature is to study how they emerge in the surface and what their contribution is to the energy budget of the solar atmosphere . on granular scales , magnetic flux appears in the solar photosphere as transient horizontal fields and small - scale magnetic loops . we have studied the latter in detail using seeing - free observations made by hinode . in 28 hours of hinode data we have detected 69 small - scale loops emerging in a quiet sun region of size at disk center . the occurrence rate is thus 0.02 events hr arcsec . the loops show clear spectropolarimetric signatures with a central region of linear polarization and two patches of circular polarization of opposite polarity . the longitudinal flux observed in each footpoint ranges from to mx , with an average of mx . this means that the loops represent the smallest emerging flux regions detected to date ( ephemeral regions have fluxes above 10 mx ; zwaan 1987 ) . the rate at which magnetic flux is carried to the quiet photosphere by the loops can be estimated to be mx s arcsec , or mx over the solar surface per day . this is about half the value derived by lites et al . ( 1996 ) for horizontal internetwork fields , but still enormous ( see for a comparison with the flux emergence rates in active and ephemeral regions ) . in the photosphere , the linear polarization associated with the top of the loop disappears soon , while the circular signals tracing the loop legs are observed to separate with time . this behavior is consistent with field lines moving upward through the solar atmosphere . also the upflows observed in the stokes v zero - crossing velocities at the position of the footpoints confirm the ascent of the loops . 23% of the loops are detected in b magnetograms that sample the upper photosphere or the temperature minimum region ( say , 400 km above the continuum forming layer ) . there is a time delay of about 5 minutes between the first detection in the photosphere and the appearance in the b magnetograms , implying an ascent speed of the order of 1 km . some of the loops continue to travel upward and become visible in h line - core filtergrams as small brightness enhancements . thus , a fraction of the loops are able to reach the low chromosphere , carrying magnetic flux with them . the rise of small - scale magnetic loops may provide an efficient mechanism to transfer substantial amounts of energy from the photosphere to the chromosphere . this would support claims by and that the tangled fields of the quiet sun store sufficient energy to heat the chromosphere . a related question is whether the small - scale loops rise up to the transition region or even the corona . the observations required to answer this question are quite challenging due to the different spatial resolutions attainable with present day optical , euv , and x - ray instruments , but should be pursued . about 77% of the loops that appear in the solar surface never rise to the chromosphere . these loops have the shortest lifetimes and show the smallest footpoint separations ; other than that , they do not differ from those reaching higher layers . usually , they disappear close to their emergence sites . the fields associated with these loops might represent the tangled quiet sun fields deduced from hanle measurements , but a definite conclusion can not be made without studying the compatibility of hanle and zeeman measurements . what is the origin of the small - scale magnetic loops ? one possibility is that they are created by the solar dynamo at the bottom of the convection zone , as part of a larger toroidal flux tube . presented three - dimensional mhd simulations of the last stages of the emergence of one such tube . they placed a horizontal tube at the top of the convection zone , just beneath the photosphere . when the initial magnetic flux is smaller than mx , the tube is not sufficiently buoyant to rise coherently against the convective flows and fragments . at the surface , the process of flux emergence occurs on very small spatial scales ( typically 1000 - 2000 km ) and short time scales ( 5 min ) . these properties are compatible with our observations . thus , the small - scale loops we have detected may simply be the result of weak flux tubes distorted by the granulation as they emerge from the convection zone into the photosphere . the fragmentation of the tubes might explain why there are emergence centers where loops appear recurrently one after the other . a preliminary analysis of the footpoint orientations suggests that the loops do not show a tendency to be aligned according to hale s rules . this can be regarded as a considerable difficulty against the idea that the origin of the loops is the solar dynamo . however , it may also be a natural consequence of the interaction of the tube s fragments with the near - surface granular convection if it removes all the information carried originally by the tube . another possibility is that the magnetic loops represent flux recycled from decaying active regions . in a sense , the mhd simulations of abbett ( 2007 ) , , and model such a process , because all of them assume an initial magnetic field in the computational box which could be provided by decaying active regions . in the simulations , the field evolve and interact with the granular flows . this interaction creates a significant amount of horizontal fields , even if the initial field is purely vertical . moreover , the simulations show the emergence of magnetic loops on granular scales . the loops are less coherent than classical flux tubes and do not connect to deeply rooted field lines . in this scenario , the magnetic fields of the quiet sun , and thus the emergence events we have described , would be the consequence of local processes acting on the remnants of decaying active regions . yet another possibility is that the loops represent submerged horizontal magnetic fields carried to the surface by the upward motions of granules or by magnetic buoyancy , as modeled by . even in that case , the origin of such submerged fields would be unknown . nowadays , we do not have enough observational constraints to distinguish between a surface dynamo or a `` exploding '' magnetic flux tube emerging from the solar interior . determining the nature of the magnetic loops observed in internetwork regions is important for a better understanding of the magnetism of the quiet sun and its role in the heating of the solar atmosphere . future efforts should concentrate on the solution of these problems . in addition to high - resolution photospheric observations , polarization measurements in the chromosphere are recquired to track the evolution of the loops with height . these data can now be provided by two - dimensional spectrometers like ibis , crisp , or imax . we thank andrs asensio ramos , pascal dmoulin and rafael manso sainz for very helpful discussions , and vronique bommier for carefully reading the manuscript . we are grateful to all the observers who participated in the hinode operation plan 14 , both at isas / jaxa and at the ground -

{"article": "the current observations , such as sneia ( supernovae type ia ) , cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) and large scale structure , converge on the fact that a spatially homogeneous and gravitationally repulsive energy component , referred as dark energy , accounts for about % of the energy density of universe . some heuristic models that roughly describe the observable consequences of dark energy were proposed in recent years , a number of them stemming from a certain physics and the others being purely phenomenological . dark energy can even behave as a phantom and effectively violate the weak energy condition . in various cosmological models , fundamental quantities are either geometrical ( if they are constructed from a spacetime geometry directly ) or physical ( if they depend upon physical fields ) . physical quantities are certainly model - dependent , while geometrical quantites are more universal . about thirty years ago , the bouncing cosmological model with torsion was suggested in ref. , but the torsion was imagined as playing role only at high densities in the early universe . goenner et al . made a general survey of the torsion cosmology , in which the equations for all the pgt ( poincar gauge theory of gravity ) cases were discussed although they only solved in detail a few particular cases . recently some authors have begun to study torsion as a possible reason of the accelerating universe . nester and collaborators consider an accounting for the accelerated universe in term of a riemann - cartan geometry : dynamic scalar torsion . they explore the possibility that the dynamic pgt connection , reflecting the nature of dynamic pgt torsion , provides the accelerating force . with the usual assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy in cosmology and specific cases of the suitable parameters and initial conditions , they find that torsion field could play a role of dark energy . one of the motivation was to avoid singularities in the initial investigations of torsion cosmology . however , it soon was found that non - linear torsion effects were more likely to produce stronger singularities . the non - linear effects turn out to play a key role for the outstanding present day mystery : the accelerated universe . in the various pgt , the connection dynamics decomposed into six modes with certain spin and parity : , , . some investigations showed that may well be the only acceptable dynamic pgt torsion modes . the pseudoscalar mode is naturally driven by the intrinsic spin of elementary fermions , therefore it naturally interacts with such sources . consequently , it is generally thought that axial torsion must be small and have small effects at the late time of cosmological evolution . this is a major reason why one does not focus on this mode at the late time . on the other hand , the scalar mode does not interact in any direct obvious fashion with any known type of matter , therefore one can imagine it as having significant magnitude and yet not being conspicuously noticed . furthermore , there is a critical non - zero value for the affine scalar curvature since mode can interact indirectly through the non - linear equations . the homogeneity and isotropy of cosmology have received strong confirmation from modern observations , which greatly restrict the possible types of non - vanishing fields . under the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy , mode has only a time component and it can be specified as the gradient of a time - dependent function . therefore , the cosmological models with the scalar mode offer a situation where dynamic torsion may lead to observable effect at late time . we emphasize again that one does not focus on the early universe , where one could indeed expect large effects ( though their signature would have to be separated from other large effects ) , and substitutionally asks about traces of torsion effects at the late time of cosmological evolution . obviously , the fine - tuning problem is one of the most important issues for the torsion cosmology . and a good model should limit the fine - tuning as much as possible . the dynamical attractor of the cosmological system has been employed to make the later time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition of the field and thus alleviates the fine - tuning problem . furthermore , nester et al have shown that the hubble parameter and have an oscillatory form for the scalar torsion cosmology . the traditional geometrical parameters , i.e. , the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter , are two elegant choices to describe the expansion state of universe but they can not distinguish various accelerating mechanism uniquely , because a quite number of models may just correspond to the same current values of and . however , sahni , saini , starobinsky and alam have introduced the statefinder pair : , . it is obviously a natural next step beyond and . fortunately , as is shown in the literatures , the statefinder parameters which are also geometrical diagnostics , are able to differentiate a series of cosmological models successfully . using the discussion of statefinder parameters in the scalar torsion cosmology , we explain easily why the present field equations modify the expansion of the universe only at late time . if the evolving trajectory of statefinder have a decelerating phase  at early time , then we can understand why the expansion of the universe until remains unchanged in the scalar torsion models . in this paper , we apply the statefinder diagnostics to the torsion cosmology . we find that there are some characteristics of statefinder parameters for the torsion cosmology that can be distinguished from the other cosmological models . the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally has an accelerating expansion at low redshifts ( late time ) and a decelerating expansion at high redshifts ( early time ) . therefore , scalar torsion cosmology can avoid some of the problems which occur in other models . especially , the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate when torsion parameter or . whether the universe has properties which are easier to explain within the scalar torsion context is a remarkable possibility demanding further exploration . the oscillatory feature of hubble parameter had earlier been reported for the braneworld cosmology and the quasi - steady state cosmology . we show that statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on the critical points of the dynamical system . one of the most interesting characteristic of the trajectories is that there are loop and curves with the shape of tadpole in the case of the torsion parameter . in this case , we fit the scalar torsion model to current type ia supernova data and find it is consistent with the observations . furthermore , we analyze preliminarily the relevance for realistic observation of the found statefinder parameters . pgt has been regarded as an interesting alternative to general relativity because of its gauge structure and geometric properties . pgt based on a riemann - cartan geometry , allows for dynamic torsion in addition to curvature . the affine connection of the riemann - cartan geometry is where is the levi - civita connection and is the torsion tensor . meantime , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be written as where and are the riemannian ricci curvature and scalar curvature , respectively , and is the covariant derivative with the levi - civita connection ( for a detailed discussion see ref . . theoretical analysis of pgt led us to consider tendentiously dynamic `` scalar mode '' . in this case , the restricted expression of the torsion can be written as \\kappa},\\ ] ] where the vector is the trace of the torsion . then , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be expressed as the gravitational lagrangian density for the scalar mode is where and is a torsion parameter . consider that the parameter is associated with quadratic scalar curvature term , so that should be positive . therefore , the field equations of the scalar mode are where is the source energy - momentum tensor and is the contribution of the scalar torsion mode to the effective total energy - momentum tensor : since current observations favor a flat universe , we will work in the spatially flat robertson - walker metric $ ] , where is the scalar factor . this engenders the riemannian ricci curvature and scalar curvature : where is the scalar factor , and is the hubble parameter . the torsion should also be only time dependent , therefore one can let ( is the torsion field ) and the spatial parts vanish . the corresponding equations of motion in the matter - dominated era are as follows where and the energy density of matter component one can scale the variables and the parameters as where is the present value of hubble parameter and is the planck length . under the transform  , eqs . - remain unchanged . after transform , new variables , , and , and new parameters , , and are all dimensionless . obviously , the newtonian limit requires . for the case of scalar torsion mode , the effective energy - momentum tensor can be represented as \\,,\\ ] ] and the off - diagonal terms vanish . the effective energy density which is deduced from general relativity . is an effective pressure , and the effective equation of state is which is induced by the dynamic torsion . , the temporal component of the torsion , the affine scalar curvature and the deceleration parameter as functions of time . we have chosen the parameters , and the initial values , , .,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , the temporal component of the torsion , the affine scalar curvature and the deceleration parameter as functions of time . we have chosen the parameters , and the initial values , , .,title=\"fig:\",width=268 ] in the case of , nester et al showed that the scalar mode can contribute an oscillating aspect to the expansion rate of the universe . this oscillatory nature can be illustrated in fig . where we have chosen , , , , and set the current time . according to scaling  , the present value of the hubble parameter is unity . obviously , is damped - oscillating at late time and is negative today , which means the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating . the value of turns from positive to negative when the time is around , which is the epoch the universe began to accelerate . however , the above result is dependent on the choice of initial data and the values of the parameters . then , the scalar torsion cosmology is unsuited to solving the fine - tuning problem in the case of . in the following sections , we ll investigate the statefinder and give the dynamics analysis for all ranges of the parameter . for the spatially flat cdm model the statefinder parameters correspond to a fixed point while for the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) containing no radiation . since the torsion cosmology have used the dynamic scalar torsion ( a geometry quantity in the riemann - cartan spacetime ) , the torsion accelerating mechanism is bound to exhibit an essential distinction in contrast with various dark energy models . therefore , its statefinder diagnostic is sure to reveal differential feature . let us now study the torsion cosmological model in detail . using eqs . - , we have the deceleration parameter (432a {1}h^{2})^{-1}\\,, \\ ] ] and the statefinder parameters (108a {1}bh^{3})^{-1}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\ ] ] and }{3bh\\left}\\ , . \\ ] ] in the following we will discuss the statefinder for four differential ranges of the torsion parameter , respectively . firstly , we consider the time evolution of the statefinder pairs and in the case of . in fig . , we plot evolution trajectories in the and planes , where we have chosen and . we see easily that cosmic expansion alternates between deceleration and acceleration in the evolving trajectories of plane , and the amplitude becomes larger and larger as increase of time . the trajectories in the plane is quite complicated , so we mark its sequence by the ordinal number . every odd number curve evolves from finite to infinite , but even number curve evolves from infinite to finite . these are quasi - periodic behaviors which corresponds to the numerical solution of ref . noticeably , the trajectories will never pass cdm point . secondly , we discuss the time evolution of the statefinder pairs and for the case of . we plot evolving trajectories in fig . , where we have chosen and . we see clearly that the cosmic acceleration is guaranteed by the dynamic scalar torsion in the evolving trajectories of plane , and the curves will converge into cdm point . the evolving trajectories go through a climbing - up stage first , then get into a rolling - down stage in the plane . lastly , trajectories tend to cdm point . furthermore , the only one forms a loop that starts from then evolves back to , and others show in the shape of tadpole . and planes for the case of torsion parameter , where we choose the parameters and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] and planes for the case of torsion parameter , where we choose the parameters and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] and planes for the case of torsion parameter , where we choose the parameters and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] and planes for the case of torsion parameter , where we choose the parameters and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] and planes for the case of , where we choose and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] and planes for the case of , where we choose and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ] and planes for the case of torsion parameter , where we choose the parameters and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] and planes for the case of torsion parameter , where we choose the parameters and . the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ] thirdly , we discuss the time evolution of the trajectories for the case of . we plot evolving trajectories in fig . , where we have chosen and . obviously , the cosmic acceleration can happen since deceleration parameter is negative . , and become larger and larger first , then less and less as the cosmic time increase . finally , we consider the time evolution of the statefinder pairs and in the case of . in fig . , we plot evolving trajectories in the and planes , where we have chosen and . we find easily that the evolving trajectories analogous to the case of except trajectories pass the cdm point . to sum up , it is very interesting to see that the scalar torsion naturally provide the accelerating force in the universe for any torsion parameter . however , it is dependent on torsion parameters that there is a decelerating  expansion before an accelerating  expansion . the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally has an accelerating expansion at low redshifts ( late time ) and a decelerating expansion at high redshifts ( early time ) for the cases of and . obviously , scalar torsion cosmology can avoid some of the problems which occur in other models . if we refuse the possibility of non - positivity of the kinetic energy , we will employ normal assumption , i. e. , . in this case , the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate . with suitable adjustments of the torsion parameters , it is possible to change the quasi - period of the expansion rate as well as its amplitudes . it is worth noting that the true values of the statefinder parameters of the universe should be determined in model - independent way . in principle , can be extracted from some future astronomical observations , especially the snap - type experiment . why there are new features for the statefinder diagnostic of torsion cosmology ? why the torsion parameter is divided into differential ranges by the statefinder answer is very simple . in fact , the statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on the attractor of cosmological dynamics . therefore , we will discuss the dynamic analysis in next section . eqs . - is an autonomous system , so we can use the qualitative method of ordinary differential equations . critical points are always exact constant solutions in the context of autonomous dynamical systems . these points are often the extreme points of the orbits and therefore describe the asymptotic behavior . if the solutions interpolate between critical points they can be divided into a heteroclinic orbit and a homoclinic orbit ( a closed loop ) . the heteroclinic orbit connects two different critical points and homoclinic orbit is an orbit connecting a critical point to itself . in the dynamical analysis of cosmology , the heteroclinic orbit is more interesting . if the numerical calculation is associated with the critical points , then we will find all kinds of heteroclinic orbits . according to equations - , we can obtain the critical points and study the stability of these points . substituting linear perturbations , and near the critical points into three independent equations , to the first orders in the perturbations , gives the evolution of the linear perturbations , from which we could yield three eigenvalues . stability requires the real part of all eigenvalues to be negative . there are five critical points of the system as follows where , and . the corresponding eigenvalues of the critical points ( i)-(v ) are using eq .  , we find that there is only a critical point in the case of . from eq .  , the corresponding eigenvalue is , so is an asymptotically stable focus . if we consider the linearized equations , then eqs . - are reduced to + the linearized system  has an exact periodic solution where , , and , and are initial values . obviously , is a critical line of center for the linearized eqs .  . in other words , there are only exact periodic solutions for the linearized system , but there are quasi - periodic solutions near the focus for the coupled nonlinear equations . this property of quasi - periodic also appears in the statefinder diagnostic with the case of . @l*15@l critical points & property & & stability + ( ` i ` ) & saddle & & unstable + ( ` ii`)&positive attractor&-1&stable + ( ` iii ` ) & negative attractor&-1&unstable + ( ` iv ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` v ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + @l*15@l critical points & property & & stability + ( ` i ` ) & focus & & stable + ( ` ii`)&saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` iii ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` iv ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` v ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + in the case of , the critical point ( ii ) is a late time de sitter attractor and ( iii ) is a negative attractor . the properties of the critical points are shown in table . the de sitter attractor indicates that torsion cosmology is an elegant scheme and the scalar torsion mode is an interesting geometric quantity for physics . in the dynamical analysis of cosmology , the heteroclinic orbit is more interesting . using numerical calculation , we plot the heteroclinic orbit connects the critical point case ( iii ) to case ( ii ) in fig . . this heteroclinic orbit is just corresponding to the loop in fig . , which is from cdm point to cdm point . furthermore , the trajectories with the shape of tadpole correspond to saddles . with . the heteroclinic orbit connects the critical points case ( iii ) to case ( ii ) . we take .,width=321 ] with . we take and the initial value . is an asymptotically stable focus point.,width=321 ] in the case of , there is only an unstable saddle where the effective equation of state tends to . therefore , the trajectories in fig . show that , and become larger and larger , then less and less as time increases . in the case of , the properties of the critical points are shown in table . the trajectories correspond to the stable focus ( see fig . 6 ) and unstable saddles with . therefore , the trajectories pass through the cdm point . in ref. , the authors have compared the numerical values of the torsion model with the observational data , in which they fixed the initial values , and , and torsion parameters and . in this section , we fixed the initial value , then fit the torsion parameters to current type ia supernovae data . the scalar torsion cosmology predict a specific form of the hubble parameter as a function of redshifts in terms of two parameters and when we chose initial values . using the relation between and the comoving distance ( where is the redshift of light emission ) and the light ray geodesic equation in a flat universe where is the scale factor . in general , the approach towards determining the expansion history is to assume an arbitrary ansatz for which is not necessarily physically motivated but is specially designed to give a good fit to the data for . given a particular cosmological model for where are model parameters , the maximum likelihood technique can be used to determine the best fit values of parameters as well as the goodness of the fit of the model to the data . the technique can be summarized as follows : the observational data consist of apparent magnitudes and redshifts with their corresponding errors and . these errors are assumed to be gaussian and uncorrelated . each apparent magnitude is related to the corresponding luminosity distance by + 25,\\ ] ] where is the absolute magnitude . for the distant sneia , one can directly observe their apparent magnitude and redshift , because the absolute magnitude of them is assumed to be constant , i.e. , the supernovae are standard candles . obviously , the luminosity distance is the ` meeting point ' between the observed apparent magnitude and the theoretical prediction . usually , one define distance modulus and express it in terms of the dimensionless ` hubble -

cartan geometry : dynamic scalar torsion . we have shown that statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on the critical points . the statefinder diagnostic divides the torsion parameter into four ranges , which is in keeping with the requirement of dynamical analysis . therefore , the statefinder diagnostic can be used to an exceedingly general category of models including several for which the notion of equation of state is not directly applicable . the statefinder diagnostic has the advantage over the dynamical analysis at the simplicity , but the latter can provide more information . the most interesting characteristic of the trajectories is that there is a loop in the case of . this behavior corresponds to the heteroclinic orbit connecting the negative attractor and de sitter attractor . the trajectories with the shape of tadpole show that they pass through the cdm fixed point along the time evolution , then the statefinder pairs are going along with a loop and they will pass through the cdm fixed point again in the future . it is worth noting that there exists closed loop in the ref . , but there is no closed loop which contains the cdm fixed point . these behaviors indicate that torsion cosmology is an elegant scheme and the scalar torsion mode is an interesting geometric quantity for physics . furthermore , the quasi - periodic feature of trajectories in the cases of or shows that the numerical solutions in ref . are not periodic , but are quasi - periodic near the focus for the coupled nonlinear equations . we fixed only the initial values , then fitted the torsion parameters to current sneia dataset . we find that the scalar torsion naturally explain the accelerating expansion of the universe for any torsion parameter . however , it is dependent and that there is a decelerating expansion before an accelerating expansion . the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally have an accelerating expansion at late time and a decelerating expansion at early time for the case of and . if we refuse the possibility of non - positivity of the kinetic energy , we have to employ normal assumption  . under this assumption , the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate . furthermore , with suitable adjustments of the torsion parameters and initial value , it is possible to change the quasi - period of expansion rate as well as its amplitudes . in order to have a quantitative understanding of the scalar torsion cosmology , the matter density , the effective mass density , and the quantity are important . this scenario bears a strong resemblance to the braneworld cosmology in a very different context by sahni , shtanov and viznyuk . the parameters in the torsion cosmology and in the cdm cosmology can nevertheless be quite different . therefore , at high redshift , the torsion cosmology asymptotically expands like a matter - dominated universe with the value of inferred from the observations of the local matter density . at low redshift , the torsion model behaves like cdm but with a renormalized value of . the difference between and is dependent on the present value of statefinder parameters . a more detailed estimate , however , lies beyond the scope of the present paper , and we will study it in a future work . finally , and should be extracted from some future astronomical observations in principle , especially the snap -

{"article": "developments are currently underway to promote the sensitivity of ligo and to improve its prospect for detecting gravitational waves emitted by compact object binaries . of particular interest are the detection of gravitational waves released during the inspiral and merger of binary black hole ( bbh ) systems . detection rates for bbh events are expected to be within 0.41000 per year with advanced ligo . it is important that rigorous detection algorithms be in place in order to maximize the number of detections of gravitational wave signals . the detection pipeline currently employed by ligo involves a matched - filtering process whereby signals are compared to a pre - constructed template bank of gravitational waveforms . the templates are chosen to cover some interesting region of mass - spin parameter space and are placed throughout it in such a way that guarantees some minimal match between any arbitrary point in parameter space and its closest neighbouring template . unfortunately , the template placement strategy generally requires many thousands of templates ( e.g. ) evaluated at arbitrary mass and spin ; something that can not be achieved using the current set of numerical relativity ( nr ) waveforms . to circumvent this issue , ligo exploits the use of analytical waveform families like phenomenological models or effective - one - body models . we shall focus here on the phenomenological b ( phenomb ) waveforms developed by . this waveform family describes bbh systems with varying masses and aligned - spin magnitudes ( i.e. non - precessing binaries ) . the family was constructed by fitting a parameterized model to existing nr waveforms in order to generate a full inspiral - merger - ringdown ( imr ) description as a function of mass and spin . the obvious appeal of the phenomb family is that it allows for the inexpensive construction of gravitational waveforms at arbitrary points in parameter space and can thus be used to create arbitrarily dense template banks . to optimize computational efficiency of the detection process it is desirable to reduce the number of templates under consideration . a variety of reduced bases techniques have been developed , either through singular - value decomposition ( svd ) , or via a greedy algorithm . svd is an algebraic manipulation that transforms template waveforms into an orthonormal basis with a prescription that simultaneously filters out any redundancies existing within the original bank . as a result , the number of templates required for matched - filtering can be significantly reduced . in addition , it has been shown in that , upon projecting template waveforms onto the orthonormal basis produced by the svd , interpolating the projection coefficients provides accurate approximations of other imr waveforms not included in the original template bank . in this paper , we continue to explore the use of the interpolation of projection coefficients . we take a novel approach that utilizes both the analytic phenomb waveform family and nr hybrid waveforms . we apply svd to a template bank constructed from an analytical waveform family to construct an orthonormal basis spanning the waveforms , then project the nr waveforms onto this basis and interpolate the projection coefficients to allow arbitrary waveforms to be constructed , thereby obtaining a new waveform approximant . we show here that this approach improves upon the accuracy of the original analytical waveform family . the original waveform family shows mismatches with the nr waveforms as high as when no extremization over physical parameters is applied ( i.e. , a measure of the faithfulness \" of the waveform approximant ) , and mismatches of when maximized over total mass ( i.e. , a measure of the effectualness \" of the waveform approximant ) . with our svd accuracy booster , we are able to construct a new waveform family ( given numerically ) with mismatches even without extremization over physical parameters . this paper is organized as follows . we begin in section where we provide definitions to important terminology used in our paper . we then compare our nr hybrid waveforms to the phenomb family and show that a mass - bias exists between the two . in section we present our svd accuracy booster applied to the case study of equal - mass , zero - spin binaries . in section we investigate the feasibility of extending this approach to include unequal - mass binaries . we finish with concluding remarks in section . a gravitational waveform is described through a complex function , , where real and imaginary parts store the sine and cosine components of the wave . the specific form of depends on the parameters of the system , in our case the total mass and the mass - ratio . while is a continuous function of time , we discretize by sampling , where the sampling times have uniform spacing . we shall also whiten any gravitational waveform . this processes is carried out in frequency space via where is the ligo noise curve and is the fourier transform of . the whitened time - domain waveform , , is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of . in the remainder of the paper , we shall always refer to whitened waveforms , dropping the subscript `` w '' . for our purposes it suffices to take to be the initial ligo noise curve . using the advanced ligo noise curve would only serve to needlessly complicate our approach by making waveforms longer in the low frequency domain . as a measure of the level of agreement between two waveforms , and , we will use their match , or overlap , . we define where is the standard complex inner product and the norm . we always consider the overlap maximized over time- and phase - shifts between the two waveforms . the time - maximization is indicated in , and the phase - maximization is an automatic consequence of the modulus . note that . for discrete sampling at points we have that where is the complex conjugate of . without whitening , would need to be evaluated in the frequency domain with a weighting factor . the primary advantage of is its compatibility with formal results for the svd , which will allow us to make more precise statements below . when maximizing over time - shifts , we ordinarily consider discrete time - shifts in integer multiples of , as this avoids interpolation . after the overlap has been maximized , it is useful to speak in terms of the mismatch , , defined simply as we use this quantity throughout the paper to measure the level of disagreement between waveforms . we use numerical waveforms computed with the spectral einstein code spec . primarily , we use the 15-orbit equal - mass ( mass - ratio ) , zero - spin ( effective spin ) waveform described in . in section , we also use unequal mass waveforms computed by . the waveforms are hybridized with a taylort3 post - newtonian ( pn ) waveform as described in at matching frequencies and for mass - ratios and , respectively . taylort4 at 3.5pn order is known to match nr simulations exceedingly well for equal - mass , zero - spin bbh systems ( see also fig . 9 of ) . for , a taylort3 hybrid is very similar to a taylort4 hybrid , cf.figure 12 of . the mismatch between taylort3 and taylort4 hybrids is below at , dropping to below for , and for . these mismatches are significantly smaller than mismatches arising in the study presented here , so we conclude that our results are not influenced by the accuracy of the utilized pn - nr hybrid waveform . for higher mass - ratios , the pn - nr hybrids have a larger error due to the post - newtonian waveform . the error - bound on the hybrids increases with mass - ratio , however , is mitigated in our study here , because we use the hybrids only for total mass of , where less of the post - newtonian waveform is in band . because nr simulations are not available for arbitrary mass ratios , we will primarily concentrate our investigation to the equal - mass and zero - spin nr hybrid waveforms described above . the full imr waveform can be generated at any point along the line through a simple rescaling of amplitude and phase with total mass of the system . despite such a simple rescaling , the line lies orthogonal to lines of constant chirp mass , therefore tracing a steep gradient in terms of waveform overlap , and encompassing a large degree of waveform structure . since our procedure for constructing an orthonormal basis begins with phenomb waveforms , let us now investigate how well these waveforms model the nr waveforms to be interpolated . for this purpose , we adopt the notation and to represent nr and phenomb waveforms of total mass , respectively . we quantify the faithfulness of the phenomb family by computing the mismatch ] is a minimum . the result of this process is shown by the solid line in the top panel of figure . allowing for a mass bias significantly reduces the mismatch for . the mass that minimizes mismatch is generally smaller than the mass of our nr `` signal '' waveform , over almost all of the mass range considered . apparently , phenomb waveforms are systematically underestimating the mass of the `` true '' nr waveforms , at least along the portion of parameter space considered here . the solid line in the bottom panel of figure plots the relative mass - bias , . at this value is , and it rises to just above for . and . a more comprehensive minimization over mass , mass ratio , and effective spin might change this result . ] it is useful to consider how this mass bias compares to the potential parameter estimation accuracy in an early detection . for a signal with a matched - filter signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 8 characteristic of early detection scenarios template / waveform mismatches will influence parameter estimation when the mismatch is . placing a horizontal cut on the top panel of figure at , we see that for phenomb waveform errors have no observational consequence ; for a phenomb waveform with the wrong mass will be the best match for the signal . for the missmatch between equal - mass phenomb waveforms and nr ( when optimizing over mass ) grows to . optimization over mass - ratio will reduce this mismatch , but we have not investigated to what degree . we aim to construct an orthonormal basis via the svd of a bank of phenomb template waveforms , and then interpolate the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto this basis to generate a waveform family with improved nr faithfulness . the first step is to construct a template bank of phenomb waveforms , with attention restricted to equal - mass , zero - spin binaries . an advantage of focusing on the line is that template bank construction can be simplified by systematically arranging templates in ascending order by total mass . with this arrangement we define a template bank to consist of phenomb waveforms , labelled  , with and with adjacent templates satisfying the relation : where is the desired overlap between templates and is some accepted tolerance in this value . the template bank is initiated by choosing a lower mass bound and assigning . successive templates are found by sequentially moving toward higher mass in order to find waveforms satisfying until some maximum mass is reached . throughout each trial , overlap between waveforms is maximized continuously over phase shifts and discretely over time shifts . for template bank construction we choose to refine the optimization over time by considering shifts in integer multiples of . we henceforth refer to our fiducial template bank which employs the parameters , , , and . the lower mass bound was chosen in order to obtain a reasonably sized template bank containing waveforms ; pushing downward to results in more than doubling the number of templates . template waveforms each have a duration of and are uniformly sampled at ( a sample frequency of ) . of memory is required to store this template bank using double - precision waveforms . the next step is to transform the template waveforms into an orthonormal basis . following the presentation in , this is achieved by arranging the templates into the rows of a matrix and factoring through svd to obtain where and are orthogonal matrices and is a diagonal matrix whose non - zero elements along the main diagonal are referred to as singular values . the svd for is uniquely defined as long as the singular values are arranged in descending order along the main diagonal of . the end result of is to convert the complex - valued templates into real - valued orthonormal basis waveforms . the basis waveform , , is stored in the row of , and associated with this mode is the singular value , , taken from the element along the main diagonal of . one of the appeals of svd is that the singular values rank the basis waveforms with respect to their ability to represent the original templates . this can be exploited in order to construct a reduced basis that spans the space of template waveforms to some tolerated mismatch . for instance , suppose we choose to reduce the basis by considering only the first basis modes while discarding the rest . template waveforms can be represented in this reduced basis by expanding them as the sum where are the complex - valued projection coefficients , the prime in is used to stress that the reduced basis is generally unable to fully represent the original template . we are guaranteed from to completely represent the template . ] it was shown in that the mismatch expected from reducing the basis in this way is given , can be inverted to determine the number of basis waveforms , , required to represent the original templates for some expected mismatch . provides a useful estimate to the mismatch in represeting templates from a reduced svd basis . in order to investigate its accuracy , however , we should compute the mismatch explicitly for each template waveform . using the orthonormality condition , it is easy to show from that the mismatch between the template and its projection can be expressed in terms of the projection coefficients : this quantity is minimized continuously over phase and discretely over time shifts in integer multiples of . choosing , predicts that of the basis waveforms from our fiducial template bank are required to represent the templates to the desired accuracy . in figure we compare the expected mismatch of to the actual mismatches computed from for each phenomb waveform in the template bank . the open squares in this plot show that the actual template mismatch has a significant amount of scatter about , but averaged over a whole remains well bounded to the expected result . the phenomb template waveforms can thus be represented to a high degree from a reasonably reduced svd basis . we are of course more interested in determining how well nr waveforms can be represented by the same reduced basis of phenomb waveforms . since nr and phenomb waveforms are not equivalent , can not be used to estimate the mismatch obtained when projecting nr waveforms onto the reduced basis . we must therefore compute their representation mismatch explicitly . a general waveform , , can be represented by the reduced basis in analogy to by expressing it as the sum : where . as before , the represented waveform will in general be neither normalized nor equivalent to the original waveform . the mismatch between them is where we remind the reader that we always minimize over continuous phase shifts and discrete time shifts of the two waveforms . in figure we use open circles to plot the representation mismatch of nr waveforms evaluated at the same set of masses from which the phenomb template bank was constructed . we see that nr waveforms can be represented in the reduced basis with a mismatch less than over most of the template bank boundary . this is about a factor of five improvement in what can be achieved by using phenomb waveforms optimized over mass . since nr waveforms were not originally included in the template bank , and because a mass - bias exists between the phenomb waveforms which were included , we can expect that the template locations have no special meaning to nr waveforms . this is evident from the thin dashed line which traces the nr representation mismatch for masses evaluated between the discrete templates . this line varies smoothly across the considered mass range and exhibits no special features at the template locations . this is in contrast to the thin solid line which traces phenomb representation mismatch evaluated between templates . in this case , mismatch rises as we move away from one template and subsequently falls back down as the next template is approached . the representation tolerance of the svd is a free parameter , which so far , we have constrained to be . when this tolerance is varied , we observe the following trends : ( i ) phenomb representation mismatch generally follows ; ( ii ) nr representation mismatch follows at first and then saturates to a minimum as the representation tolerance is continually reduced . these trends are observed in figure where we plot nr and phenomb representation mismatch averaged over the mass boundary of the template bank evaluated both at and between templates . the saturation in nr representation mismatch occurs when the reduced basis captures all of the nr waveform structure contained within the phenomb basis . reducing the basis further hits a point of diminishing returns as the increased computational cost associated with a larger basis outweighs the benefit of marginally improving nr match . we now wish to examine the possibility of using the reduced svd basis of phenomb template waveforms to construct a new waveform family with improved nr representation . the new waveform family would be given by a numerical interpolation of the projection coefficients of nr waveforms expanded onto the reduced basis . here we test this using the fiducial template bank and reduced basis described above . the approach is to sample nr projection coefficients , , at some set of locations , , and then perform an interpolation to obtain the continuous function that can be evaluated for arbitrary . the accuracy of the interpolation scheme is maximized by finding the space for which are smooth functions of . it is reasonable to suppose that the projection coefficients will vary on a similar scale over which the waveforms themselves vary . hence , a suitable space to sample along is the space of constant waveform overlap . we define this to be the space ] . to begin this calculation , it is useful to consider the square of the overlap , where we have dropped the explicit mass - dependence and subscripts for convenience . using and taylor - expanding the right - hand - side of to second order in , we find to second order in , the mismatch is therefore we note that the right - hand - side of can be written as , where is the part of orthogonal to , however , for simplicity , we proceed by dropping the last term in : using , this gives \\le \\\\ {2}\\sum {k=1}^{n ' } \\left|r k(m)\\right|^2 + {2}\\sum {k = n'+1}^{2n}\\left|\\mu k(m)\\right|^2 + {2}|{\\bf h} \\perp|^2 \\ ] ] we thus see three contributions to the total mismatch : ( i ) the interpolation error , ; ( ii ) the truncation error from the discarded waveforms of the reduced basis , ; ( iii ) the failure of the svd basis to represent the nr waveform , . the sum of the last two terms , which together make up the representation error , is traced by the dashed line in figure . the goal for our new waveform family is to have an interpolation error that is negligible compared to the representation error . to remove the mass - dependence of interpolation error in , we introduce the maximum interpolation error of each mode , this allows the bound to place an upper limit on the error introduced by interpolation . figure plots as a function of mode - number as well as the cumulative sum . the data pertains to an interpolation performed using chebyshev polynomials on the reduced svd basis containing the frist of waveforms . in this case , we find the interpolation error to be largely dominated by the lowest - order modes and also partially by the highest - order modes . interpolated coefficients for various modes are plotted in figure and help to explain the features seen in figure . in the first place , interpolation becomes increasingly more difficult for higher - order modes due to their increasing complexity . this problem is mitigated by the fact that high - order modes are less important for representing waveforms , as evidenced by the diminishing amplitude of projection coefficients . although low - order modes are much smoother and thus easier to interpolate , their amplitudes are considerably larger meaning that interpolation errors are amplified with respect to high - order modes . summarizes the three components adding to the final mismatch of our interpolated waveform family . their total contribution can be computed directly from the interpolated coefficients in a manner similar to : = 1 - ^{n^\\prime } \\mu k^\\prime(m ) \\mu k^{\\prime^*}(m)}. \\ ] ] in the case of perfect interpolation for which , and reduce to and respectively , and the total mismatch is simply the representation error of the reduced basis . in figure open circles show the total mismatch between our interpolated waveform family and the true nr waveforms for various masses . also plotted is the nr representation error without interpolation and the mismatch between nr and phenomb waveforms minimized over mass . we see that interpolation introduces only small additional mismatch to the interpolated waveform family , and remains well below the optimized nr - phenomb mismatch . this demonstrates the efficacy of using svd coupled to nr waveforms to generate a faithful waveform family with improved accuracy over the phenomb family that was originally used to create templates . this represents a general scheme for improving phenomenological models and presents an interesting new opportunity to enhance the matched - filtering process employed by ligo . so far , we have focused on the total mass axis of parameter space . as already discussed , this served as a convenient model - problem , because the nr waveform can be rescaled to any total mass , so that we are able to compare against the `` correct '' answer . the natural extension of this work is to expand into higher dimensions where nr waveforms are available only at certain , discrete mass - ratios . in this section we consider expanding our approach of interpolating nr projection coefficients from a two - dimensional template bank containing unequal - mass waveforms . we compute a template bank of phenomb waveforms covering mass - ratios from 1 to 6 and total masses . this mass range is chosen to facilitate comparison with previous work done by . for the two - dimensional case the construction of a template bank is no longer as straightforward as before due to the additional degree of freedom associated with varying . one method that has been advanced for this purpose is to place templates hexagonally on the waveform manifold . using this procedure we find templates are required to satisfy a minimal match of 0.97 . following the waveform preparation of , templates are placed in the rows of a matrix with real and imaginary components filled in alternating fashion where the whitened waveforms are arranged in such a way that their peak amplitudes are aligned . the waveforms are sampled for a total duration of with uniform spacing so that of memory is required to store the contents of if double precision is desired . application of transforms the 16 complex - valued waveforms into 32 real - valued orthonormal basis waveforms . the aim is to sample the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the svd basis of phenomb waveforms using mass - ratios for which nr data exists , and then interpolate amongst these to construct a numerical waveform family that can be evaluated for arbitrary parameters . this provides a method for evaluating full imr waveforms for mass - ratios that have presently not been simulated . to summarize , we take some nr waveform , , or total mass and mass - ratio , and project it onto the basis waveform in order to obtain next we apply some two - dimensional interpolation scheme on to construct continuous functions that can be evaluated for arbitrary values of and bounded by the regions of the template bank . the interpolated waveform family is given numerically by the form : as before , the interpolation process works best if we can develop a scheme for which the projection coefficients are smoothly varying functions of and . following the procedure described in , the complex phase of the first mode is subtracted from all modes : }\\mu k(m , q ) . \\ ] ] to motivate why might be useful , let us consider modifying the phenomb waveform family with a parameter - dependent complex phase : when constructing a template bank , or when using a template bank , such a complex phase is irrelevant , because the waveforms are always optimized over a phase - shift . however , will appear in the projection coefficients , , therefore , if one had chosen a function with fine - scale structure , this structure would be inherited by the projection coefficients . for traditional uses of waveform families the overall complex phase is irrelevant , and therefore , little attention may have been paid to how it varies with parameters . the transformation removes the ambiguity inherent in by choosing it such that . this choice ties the complex phase to the physical variations of the coefficient , and does therefore eliminate all unphysical phase - variations on finer scales . in the leftmost panels of figure we plot the real part of the smoothed coefficients for phenomb waveforms projected onto the basis modes and . the middle panels show the same thing except using the nr waveforms evaluated at the set of mass - ratios = \\{1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 } for which we have simulated waveforms . obviously , the refinement along the axis is much finer for the phenomb waveforms since they can be evaluated for arbitrary mass - ratio , whereas we are limited to sampling at only 5 discrete mass - ratios for nr waveforms . for comparison purposes , the rightmost panels of figure show the phenomb projection coefficients coarsened to the same set of mass - ratios for which the nr waveforms are restricted to . we find the same general behaviour as before that low - order modes display the smoothest structure , while high - order modes exhibit increasing complexity . a plausible interpolation scheme would be to sample for nr waveforms of varying mass for constant mass ratio ( i.e. as we have done previously ) and then stitch these together across the axis . since the projection coefficients in figure show sinusoidal structure they must be sampled with at least the nyquist frequency along both axes . however , looking at the middle and rightmost panels it appears as though this is not yet possible given the present set of limited nr waveforms . at best the 5 available mass - ratios are just able to sample at the nyquist frequency along the axis for high - order modes . in order to achieve a reasonable interpolation from these projection coefficients the current nr data thus needs to be appended with more mass - ratios . based on the left panels of figure a suitable choice would be to double the current number of mass - ratios to include = \\{1.5 , 2.5 , 3.5 , 4.5 , 5 , 5.5}. hence , though it is not yet practical to generate an interpolated waveform family using the svd boosting scheme applied to nr waveforms , the possibility remains open as more nr waveforms are generated . we have shown that svd can be used to improve the representation of nr waveforms from a phenomb template bank . a reasonably reduced svd basis was able to reduce mismatch by a factor of five compared to phenomb waveforms optimized over mass . there was also no mass - bias associated with the svd basis and therefore no optimization over physical parameters required . this occurs because svd unifies a range of waveform structure over an extended region of parameter space so that any biases become blended into its basis . svd therefore represents a generalized scheme through which phenomenological waveform families can be de - biased and enhanced for use as matched - filter templates . we were able to calibrate an svd basis of phenomb templates against nr waveforms in order to construct a new waveform family with improved accuracy . this was accomplished by interpolating the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the phenomb basis . only marginal error was introduced by the interpolation scheme and the new waveform family provided a more faithful representation of the `` true '' nr signal compared to the original phenomb model . this was shown explicitly for the case of equal - mass , zero - spin binaries . we proceeded to investigate the possibility of extending this approach to phenomb template banks containing unequal - mass waveforms . at present , however , this method is not yet feasible since the current number of mass - ratios covered by nr simulations are unable to sample the projection coefficients with the nyquist frequency . this method will improve as more nr waveforms are simulated and should be sufficient if the current sampling rate of mass - ratios were to double . we thank ilana macdonald for preparing the hybrid waveforms used in this study . kc , jde and hpp gratefully acknowledge the support of the national science and engineering research council of canada , the canada research chairs program , the canadian institute for advanced research , and industry canada and the province of ontario through the ministry of economic development and innovation . dk gratefully acknowledges the support of the max planck society .", "summary": "matched - filtering for the identification of compact object mergers in gravitational - wave antenna data involves the comparison of the data stream to a bank of template gravitational waveforms . typically the template bank is constructed from phenomenological waveform models since these can be evaluated for an arbitrary choice of physical parameters . recently it has been proposed that singular value decomposition ( svd ) can be used to reduce the number of templates required for detection . as we show here , another benefit of svd is its removal of biases from the phenomenological templates along with a corresponding improvement in their ability to represent waveform signals obtained from numerical relativity ( nr ) simulations . using these ideas , we present a method that calibrates a reduced svd basis of phenomenological waveforms against nr waveforms in order to construct a new waveform approximant with improved accuracy and faithfulness compared to the original phenomenological model . the new waveform family is given numerically through the interpolation of the projection coefficients of nr waveforms expanded onto the reduced basis and provides a generalized scheme for enhancing phenomenological models ."}
{"article": "in quantum information processing , information is stored and processed with a quantum system . a quantum system is always in contact with its surrounding environment , which leads to decoherence in the quantum system . decoherence must be suppressed for quantum information stored in qubits to be intact . there are several proposals to fight against decoherence . quantum error correction , abriviated as qec hereafter , is one of the most promising candidate to suppress environmental noise , which leads to decoherence . by adding extra ancillary qubits , in analogy with classical error correction , it is possible to encode a data qubit to an -qubit codeword in such a way that an error which acted in the error quantum channel is identified by measuring another set of ancillary qubits added for error syndrome readout . then the correct codeword is recovered from a codeword suffering from a possible error by applying a recovery operation , whose explicit form is determined by the error syndrome readout . in contrast with the conventional scheme outlined in the previous paragraph , there is a scheme in which neither syndrome readouts nor syndrome readout ancilla qubits are required . in particular , in , a general efficient scheme was proposed . a data qubit is encoded with encoding ancilla qubits by the same encoding circuit as the conventional one , after which a noisy channel is applied on the codeword . subsequently , the inverse of the encoding circuit is applied on a codeword , which possibly suffers from an error . the resulting state is a tensor product of the data qubit state with a possible error and the ancilla qubit state . it is possible to correct erroneous data qubit state by applying correction gates with the ancilla qubits as control qubits and the data qubit as a target qubit . this paper presents two examples of error correcting codes falling in the second category . the noisy quantum channel is assumed to be fully correlated , which means all the qubits constituting the codeword are subject to the same error operators . in most physical realizations of a quantum computer , the system size is typically on the order of a few micrometers or less , while the environmental noise , such as electromagnetic wave , has a wavelength on the order of a few millimeters or centimeters . then it is natural to assume all the qubits in the register suffer from the same error operator . to demonstrate the advantage of the second category , we restrict ourselves within the noise operators in the following , where is the number of constituent qubits in the codeword . we show that there exists an -qubit encoding which accommodates an -qubit data state if is odd and an -qubit date state if is even . although the channel is somewhat artificial as an error channel , we may apply our error correction scheme in the following situation . suppose alice wants to send qubits to bob . their qubit bases differ by unitary operations or . even when they do not know which basis the other party employs , the can correctly send qubits by adding one extra qubits ( when is odd ) or two extra qubits ( when is even ) . we state the theorems and prove them in the next section . the last section is devoted to summary and discussions . in the following , denotes the th component of the pauli matrices and we take the basis vectors so that is diagonalized . we introduce operators and acting on the -qubit space , where as mentioned before . let be complex matrices , and let . denote by the ( joint ) rank- numerical range of , which is the collection of such that for some rank- orthogonal projection . a quantum channel of the form has a -dimensional quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) if and only if . to prove this statement , we need to recall the knill - laflamme correctability condition , which asserts that given a quantum channel with error operators , is a qecc of if and only if , where is the projection operator with the range space . it should be clear that if and only if there is a qecc with dimension . now it follows from and the relations when is even and when is odd that the channel  has a -dimensional qecc if and only if by noting that irrespective of rank , we find if and only if . suppose is odd . then . our proof is constructive . for , denote . let then , where is the number of -combinations from elements . since we have let be the orthogonal projection onto . then the above observation shows that and . therefore , , which shows that and hence is shown to be a -dimensional qecc . now let us turn to the even case . we first state a lemma which is necessary to prove the theorem . let be a normal matrix . then the rank- numerical range of is the intersection of the convex hulls of any eigenvalues of . the proof of the lemma is found in . suppose is even . then but . proof let . by theorem , . consider observe that the projection onto satisfies and and hence , which proves . since is a commuting family , and can be diagonalized simultaneously . we may assume that since , we have let us show that . we first note the identity for hermitian . let us replace by and by to obtain . since and commute , is normal and lemma is applicable . from eqs .  and  , we find has eigenvalues and each eigenvalue is -fold degenerate . by taking and in lemma , we find the rank- numerical range of is the intersection of the convex hulls of any eigenvalues . since each eigenvalue has multiplicity , each convex hull involves at least three eigenvalues . by inspecting four eigenvalues plotted in the complex plane , we easily find the intersection of all the convex hulls is a single point , which proves . similarly , we prove . from these equalities we obtain suppose . let be a rank- projection such that . let \\ ] ] where each has size . from and , we have four independent equations let be the singular value decomposition of , where is a nonnegative diagonal matrix and . then the above equations are solved as by collecting these results , we find the projection operator is decomposed as \\\\\\,.\\ ] ] since rank and , it follows from that . let then both and are non - singular . on the other hand , the assumption implies and hence , which is a contradiction . therefore , . in the following , we give an explicit construction of qecc for in eq .  with odd . the technique is based on theorem and the results in . let be the matrix with columns in the set define the matrix $ ] . in our qec , an -qubit state is encoded with one ancilla qubit as . then a noisy quantum channel is applied on the encoded state and subsequently the recovery operation is applied so that the decoded state automatically appears in the output with no syndrome measurements . our qec is concisely summarized as where . choosing an encoding amounts to assigning each of column vectors in a basis vector of the whole hilbert space without repetition . therefore there are large degrees of freedom in the choice of encoding . in the following examples , we have chosen encoding whose quantum circuit can be implemented with the least number of cnot gates . since our decoding circuit is the inverse of the encoding circuit , it is also implemented with the least number of cnot gates . when , the unitary operation can be chosen as when , can be chosen as figure shows quantum circuits of the matrix for and . -qubit state with a single ancilla qubit initially in the state .

{"article": "it has become a generally agreed concept that the euv dimming observed during the onset of a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) manifests the coronal mass loss of the cme , and thus we basically expect a one - to - one correlation between the detections of cmes and euv dimmings , unless there exist special circumstances . for instance , the cme could originate behind the limb , in which case the euv dimming is obscured , or the cme could start in the upper corona , where there is little euv emission because of the gravitational stratification . the latter case would imply very low masses compared with a cme that originates at the base of the corona , i.e. , at two thermal scale heights . however , there exists a case with an average cme mass that did not leave any footprints behind in euv ( robbrecht et al . a statistical study on the simultaneous detection of euv dimmings and cmes has recently been performed by bewsher et al . this study based on soho / cds and lasco data confirms a 55% association rate of dimming events with cmes , and vice versa a 84% association rate of cmes with dimming events . some of the non - associated events may be subject to occultation , cme detection sensitivity , or incomplete temperature coverage in euv and soft x - rays . perhaps the cme - dimming association rate will reach 100% once the stereo spacecraft arrive at a separation of and cover all equatorial latitudes of the sun . a number of studies have been carried out by using the detection of coronal dimming to identify cme source regions , focusing on transient coronal holes caused by filament eruptions ( rust 1983 ; watanabe et al . 1992 ) , euv dimming at cme onsets ( harrison 1997 ; aschwanden et al . 1999 ) , soft x - ray dimming after cmes ( sterling & hudson 1997 ) , soft x - ray dimming after a prominence eruption ( gopalswamy & hanaoka 1998 ) , simultaneous dimming in soft x - rays and euv during cme launches ( zarro et al . 1999 ; harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . 2003 ) , determinations of cme masses from euv dimming from spectroscopic data ( harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . 2003 ) or from euv imaging data ( zhukov and auchere 2004 ; aschwanden et al . all these studies support the conclusion that dimmings in the corona ( either detected in euv , soft x - rays , or both ) are unmistakable signatures of cme launches , and thus can be used vice versa to identify the mutual phenomena . in this study here we attempt for the first time to model the kinematics of a cme and the resulting euv dimming quantitatively , which provides us unique physical parameters of the cme source region and on the cme kinematics in the initial acceleration phase . the dynamics of a cme can often be characterized by a rapid expansion of a magnetically unstable coronal volume that expands from the lower corona upward into the heliosphere . different shapes have been used to approximately describe the 3d geometry of a cme , such as a spherical bubble , an ice - cone , a crescent , or a helical flux rope , which expand in a self - similar fashion and approximately maintain the aspect ratio in vertical and horizontal directions during the initial phase of the expansion . here we develop a four - dimensional ( 4d=3d+t ) model that describes the 3d evolution of the cme geometry in time ( t ) in terms of 4d electron density distributions that allow us also to predict and forward - fit a corresponding euv intensity image data cube in an observed wavelength . for the sake of simplicity we start in our model here with the simplest case , assuming : ( 1 ) spherical 3d geometry for the cme front and cavity ; ( 2 ) self - similar expansion in time ; ( 3 ) density compression in the cme front and adiabatic volume expansion in the cme cavity ; ( 4 ) mass conservation for the sum of the cme front , cavity , and external coronal volume ; ( 5 ) hydrostatic ( gravitational stratification ) or super - hydrostatic density scale heights ; ( 6 ) line - tying condition for the magnetic field at the cme base ; and ( 7 ) a magnetic driving force that is constant during the time interval of the initial expansion phase . this scenario is consistent with the traditional characterization of a typical cme morphology in three parts , including a cme front ( leading edge ) , a cavity , and a filament ( although we do not model the filament part ) . the expanding cme bubble sweeps up the coronal plasma that appears as a bright rim at the observed `` cme front '' or leading edge . the interior of the cme bubble exhibits a rapid decrease in electron density due to the adiabatic expansion , which renders the inside of the cme bubble darker in euv and appears as the observed `` cme cavity '' . the assumption of adiabatic expansion implies no mass and energy exchange across the outer cme boundary , and thus is consistent with the assumption of a low plasma -parameter in the corona with perfect magnetic confinement , while the cme bubble will become leaking in the outer corona and heliosphere , where the plasma -parameter exceeds unity ( not included in our model here ) . a spherical 3d geometry can be characterized by one single free parameter , the radius of the sphere . the self - similar expansion maintains the spherical shape , so the boundary of the cme bubble can still be parameterized by a single time - dependent radius . the time - dependence of the cme expansion is controlled by magnetic forces , e.g. , by a lorentz force or hoop force . for sake of simplicity we assume a constant force during the initial phase of the cme expansion , which corresponds to a constant acceleration and requires three free parameters  to characterize the radial cme expansion , where is the initial radius at starting time , is the initial velocity and is the acceleration of the radial expansion . for the motion of the cme centroid at height we assume a similar quadratic parameterization , where is the initial height at starting time , is the initial velocity and is the acceleration of the vertical motion . this parameterization is consistent with a fit to a theoretical mhd simulation of a breakout cme ( lynch et al . 2004 ) as well as with kinematic fits to observed cmes ( byrne et al . 2009 ) . , the outer radius of the cme sphere is , and the inner radius of the cme front is . these parameters increase quadratically with time . the circular footpoint area of the cme with radius stays invariant during the self - similar expansion in order to satisfy the line - tying condition of the coronal magnetic field at the footpoints.,width=313 ] further we constrain the cme geometry with a cylindrical footpoint area of radius , which connects from the solar surface to the lowest part of the spherical cme bubble . in order to ensure magnetic line - tying at the footpoints , the cme bubble should always be located above the cyclidrical footpoint base , which requires that the initial height satisfies and the acceleration constants are . we visualize the model geometry in fig . 1 . the time - invariant cme footprint area allows us a simple mass estimate of the cme from the cylindrical volume integrated over a vertical scale height , since the spherical cme bubble will eventually move to large heights with no additional mass gain ( at time , see right - hand panel in fig.1 ) . assuming adiabatic expansion inside the cme cavity , the electron density in the confined plasma decreases reciprocally to the expanding volume , i.e. , so it drops with the third power as a function of time from the initial value ( of the average density inside the cme ) . for the mass distribution inside the cme we distinguish between a compression region at the outer envelope , containing the cme front , and a rarefaction region in the inside , which is also called cme cavity . we define an average width of the cme front that is assumed to be approximately constant during the self - similar expansion of the cme . while the radius demarcates the outer radius of the cme front , we denote the inner radius of the cme front or the radius of the cavity with , which has an initial value of . the total volume of the cme is composed of a spherical volume with radius and the cylindrical volume beneath the cme with a vertical height of , \\ , \\ ] ] which has an initial volume value of , \\ .\\ ] ] the volume of the cme front is essentially the difference between the outer and inner sphere ( neglecting the cylindrical base at the footpoint ) while the volume of the cavity is , we have now to define the time - dependent densities in the cme , for both the cme front , which sweeps up plasma during its expansion , as well as for the cme cavity , which rarifies due to the adiabatic expansion . the total mass of the plasma that is swept up from the external corona in a cme corresponds to the total cme volume minus the initial volume of the cme cavity , \\\\ & = m p < n e > { 4 \\over 3 } \\pi \\ , \\ ] ] where is the mass of the hydrogen atom and is the electron density in the external corona averaged over the cme volume . the same mass has to be contained inside the volume of the cme front , \\ , \\ ] ] thus , mass conservation yields a ratio of the average electron density in the cme front and the average external density of this density ratio amounts to unity at the initial time , i.e. , and monotonically increases with time . the maximum value of the density jump in mhd shocks derived from the rankine - hugoniot relations ( e.g. , priest 1982 ) is theoretically . fast cmes are expected to be supersonic and will have a higher compression factor at the cme front than slower cmes . thus we keep the maximum compression factor as a free parameter , keeping in mind that physically meaningful solutions should be in the range of . since we prescribe both the width of the cme front as well as a maximum density compression ratio we obtain a definition of the critical value for the cavity radius when the prescribed maximum density compression is reached ( using eq . 11 ) , which yields the critical radius , ^{1/3 } \\ .\\ ] ] therefore , only plasma outside this critical radius can be compressed in the cme front , while the plasma inside this critical radius dilutes by adiabatic expansion and forms the cavity , yielding an average density ratio inside the cavity ( according to eq . 3 ) , }^3 & { \\rm for}\\ \\rho(t ) \\ge r(t ) \\\\ { \\left }^3 & { \\rm for}\\ \\rho(t ) < r(t ) \\right . \\ .\\ ] ] our numerical model of a spherical cme expansion has a total of 14 free parameters : 3 positional parameters ( the heliographic coordinates  and height of the initial cme centroid position ) , 5 kinematic parameters ( starting time , velocities , accelerations ) , 2 geometric parameters ( initial radius and width of the cme front ) , and 4 physical parameters ( coronal base density , maximum density compression factor in the cme front , the mean coronal temperature at the observed wavelength filter ) , and a vertical density scale height factor ( or super - hydrostaticity factor ) that expresses the ratio of the effective density scale height to the hydrostatic scale height at temperature ) . the temperature defines the hydrostatic scale height of the corona in the observed temperature range , which enters the definition of the effective density scale height ( e.g. , eq . in aschwanden 2004 ) , }\\ .\\ ] ] thus , assuming an exponentially stratified atmosphere ( eq . 15 ) , a density compression factor in the cme front ( eq . 12 ) , and adiabatic expansion inside the cme cavity ( eq . 14 ) , we have the following time - dependent 3d density model : where is the distance of an arbitrary location with 3d coordinates to the instantaneous center position ] and $ ] for the time sequence . the images in fig . 2 and 3 are displayed as a baseline difference ( by subtracting a pre - cme image at 18:36 ut ) to enhance the contrast of the cme edge . the circular fits to the cme outer boundaries are overlayed in fig . 2 and 3 . both images have been coaligned and rotated into epipolar coordinates ( inhester et al . 2006 ) , so that the y - coordinates of a corresponding feature are identical in the spacecraft a and b images , while the x - coordinates differ according to the spacecraft separation angle , which amounts to at the time of the cme event . the epipolar coordinates measured from both spacecraft are then related to the heliographic longitude , latitude , and distance from sun center as follows , which can directly be solved to obtain the spherical ( epipolar ) coordinates , ^ 2 } \\\\ b = \\arcsin { ( y a / r c ) } \\ ] ] therefore , using stereoscopic triangulation , we can directly determine the spherical coordinates , for all 16 time frames , as well as obtain the cme curvature radii from the circular fits to the cmes . we plot the so obtained observables , , , and in fig . 3 and determine our model parameters and from the averages . we obtain a longitude of ( for spacecraft stereo / a ) , ( for spacecraft stereo / b ) , and a latitude . thus , the cme source region is clearly occulted for stereo / a . these epipolar coordinates can be rotated into an ecliptic coordinate system by the tilt angle of the spacecraft a / b plane . viewed from earth , the longitude is approximately . thus , the cme source region is behind the east limb when seen from earth . this explains why the euv dimming is seen uncontaminted from post - flare loops , which are seen by stereo / b but hidden for stereo / a . ( top panel ) and latitude ( second panel ) of the cme centroid , the radius of the cme sphere ( third panel ) , and cme centroid height ( bottom ) . the average values are and for the heliographic position . the cme radius and height are fitted with quadratic functions ( dashed curves ) , yielding the constants hrs ( 18:38 ut ) , mm , mm , and accelerations km s and km s ( see eqs . 1 - 2).,width=313 ] we plot also the observables and in fig . 4 and determine the model parameters , , , by fitting the quadratic functions ( eq . 1 ) and ( eq . 2 ) , for which we obtain the starting time hrs ( 18:38 ut ) , the initial cme radius mm , the initial height mm , and the accelerations km s for the cme radius expansion , and km s for the height motion . the initial velocity is found to be negligible ( and ) . we estimate the accuracy of the acceleration values to be of order , based on the uncertainty of defining the leading edge of the cme . thus , we determined 9 out of the 14 free parameters of our model sofar . note that the acceleration measured here refers to the very origin of the cme in low coronal heights of solar radii observed in euvi data . the acceleration is expected to be initially high and to rapidly decline further out , when the driving magnetic forces decrease at large altitudes . this explains why our values for the acceleration in low coronal heights are significantly higher than measured further out in the heliosphere , typically in the order of tens of m s in height ranges of 5 - 22 solar radii , as measured with soho / lasco . soho / lasco reported even a slightly negative acceleration at altitutes of 5 - 22 solar radii . the driving magnetic forces that accelerate a cme are clearly confined to much lower altitudes . we model the 3d geometry of the cme bubble with the time - dependent radius and the width of the cme compression region . in fig . 5 we show cross - sectional euv brightness profiles across the cme in horizontal direction ( parallel to the solar surface ) and in vertical direction for the euvi / a 171 observations ( indicated with dotted lines in fig . these baseline - subtracted profiles clearly show a progressive dimming with a propagating bright rim at the cme boundary , which corresponds to the density compression region at the lateral expansion fronts of the cme . the bright rims are clearly visible in the images during 18:46:56 ut shown in fig . 2 . the average width of the observed bright rims is mm , a value we adopt in our model . finally we are left with the four physical parameters , and . since we show here only data obtained with the 171 filter , the mean temperature is constrained by the peak temperature of the instrumental euvi response function , which is at mk . this constrains the thermal scale height to km . the remaining free parameters , , and need to be determined from best - fit solutions by forward - fitting of simulated euv brightness images ( or profiles , as shown in fig . 5 ) to observed euv brightness images ( or profiles ) . the euv emission measure in each pixel position can be computed by line - of - sight integration along the -axis in our 3d density cube per pixel area for each time , from which the intensity in the model image in units of dn s can be directly obtained by multiplying with the instrumental response function of the 171 filter , where dn s mk and the fwhm of the 171 filter is mk . in fig . 6 we show best - fit solutions of horizontal and vertical brightness profiles . the absolute flux level is proportional to the coronal base density squared , which we obtain by minimizing the mean flux difference between simulated and observed flux profiles . we obtain a best - fit value of . the super - hydrostaticity factor is most sensitive to the vertical flux profile ( fig . 5 , right - hand side panels ) , for which we find a best - fit value of . thus , the average density scale height in the cme region is slightly super - hydrostatic , as expected for dynamic processes . these values are typical for quiet - sun corona and active region conditions ( see figs . 6 and 10 in aschwanden and acton 2001 ) . the last free parameter , the maximum density compression factor , affects mostly the brightness of the cme rims . fitting the brightness excess at the cme rims at those times where bright rims are visible are consistent with a value of . ll parameter & best -

sectional horizontal and vertical brightness profiles ( fig . 5 ) , we are now in the position to inter - compare the numerically simulated images with the observed images , as shown in fig . 6 for 5 selected times , for both the stereo / a and b spacecraft . the comparison exhibits a good match for the extent of the dimming region the the bright lateral rims , both extending over about 1.5 thermal scale heights above the solar surface . the base - difference images of euvi / a reveal a fairly symmetric cme ( as the model is by design ) , surrounded by spherical bright rims at the northern and southern cme boundaries ( as the model is able to reproduce it ) . the model , however , is less in agreement with the observed euvi / b images . the extent of the euv dimming region matches relatively exactly , although the observed dimming region is somewhat cluttered with bright postflare loops that appear in the aftermath of the cme , which are mostly hidden in the euvi / a observations . the biggest discrepancy between the model and the euvi / b observations is the location of the brightest rim of the cme boundary . the combination of projection effects and gravitational stratification predict a brighter rim on the west side , where we look through a longer and denser column depth tangentially to the cme bubble , which is not apparent in the observations of euvi / b . instead , there is more bright emission just above the eastern limb that can not be reproduced by the model . apparently there exists stronger density compression on the eastern side of the cme bubble than the model predicts . another inconsistency is the bright loop seen in euvi / b at 18:51 ut , which does not match the surface of the modeled cme sphere as constrained by euvi / a . apparently , there are substantial deviations from a spherically symmetric cme bubble model that are visible in euvi / b but not in euvi / a . perhaps a flux rope model could better fit the observations than a spherical shell model . these discrepancies between the observations and our simple first - cut model provide specific constraints for a more complex model ( with more free parameters ) that includes inhomogeneities in the density distribution of the cme . our model allows us , in principle , to estimate the cme mass by integrating the density over the entire cme sphere , which is of course growing with time , but expected to converge to a maximum value once the cme expands far out into the heliosphere . a simple lower limit can analytically be obtained by integrating the density in the cylindrical volume above the footpoint area , from our best - fit values mm , , and the thermal scale height of mm , we obtain a lower limit of g. however , this cme appears to expand in a cone - like fashion in the lowest density scale height , so the total volume and mass is likely to be about a factor of higher . moreover , the mass detected in 171 amounts only to about a third of the total cme mass ( aschwanden et al . 2009b ) , so a more realistic estimate of the total cme mass is about a factor 6 higher than our lower limit , i.e. , g , which brings it into the ballpark of previous cme mass determinations of this particular event , i.e. , g from stereo / cor-2 white - light observations ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) , or g from stereo / euvi observations ( aschwanden et al . we developed an analytical 4d model that simulates the cme expansion and euv dimming in form of a time sequence of euv images that can directly be fitted to stereoscopic observations of stereo / euvi . the dynamic evolution of the cme is characterized by a self - similar adiabatic expansion of a spherical cme shell , containing a bright front with density compression and a cavity with density rarefaction , satisfying mass conservation of the cme and ambient corona . we forward - fitted this model to stereo / euvi observations of the cme event of 2008-mar-25 and obtained the following results : 1 . the model is able to track the true 3d motion and expansion of the cme by stereoscopic triangulation and yields an acceleration of m s for both the vertical centroid motion and radial expansion during the first half hour after cme launch . fitting the euv dimming region of the model to the data mostly constrains the coronal base density in the cme region  and the density scale height , which was found to be super - hydrostatic by a factor of . the average cme expansion speed during the first 10 minutes is approximately km s , similar to the propagation speeds measured for eit waves in the initial phase ( i.e. , km s , veronig et al . 2008 ; km s , long et al . 2008 ; km s , patsourakos et al . 2009 ) , and thus the cme expansion speed seems to be closely related to the associated propagation kinematics of eit waves . the derived base density , scale height , and footpoint area constrain the cme mass , but accurate estimates require a more complete temperature coverage with other euv filters ( e.g. , see aschwanden et al . 2009b ) . 5 . the width and density compression factor of the cme front are also constrained by our model , but accurate values require a perfectly homogeneous cme shell . 6 . while the spherical shell geometry reproduces the euvi / a observations well , significant deviations are noted in the euvi / b observations , indicating substantial inhomogeneities in the cme shell , possibly requiring a hybrid model of bubble and flux rope geometries . the most important conclusion of this modeling study is that euv dimming can be understood in a quantitative manner and that it provides a direct measurement of the coronal mass loss of a cme . this exercise has shown that the spherical shell geometry can reproduce a number of observed features of an evolving cme , which constrains the physical and kinematic parameters of the initial phase of the cme launch , but reveals also significant deviations that require a modification of the idealized homogeneous spherical shell model . the method of analytical 4d models with forward - fitting to stereoscopic euv images appears to be a promising tool to investigate quantitatively the kinematics of cmes . combining with simultaneous magnetic or mhd modeling may further constrain the physical parameters and ultimately provide the capability to discriminate between different theoretical cme models . full 4d modeling of the initial cme expansion may also provide a self - consistent treatment of eit waves and cme expansion ( e.g. , chen et al . 2005 ) , for which we find similar kinematic parameters . this work is supported by the nasa stereo under nrl contract n00173 -

{"article": "one of the fundamental problems in the classification of complex surfaces is to find a new family of complex surfaces of general type with . in this paper we construct new simply connected numerical campedelli surfaces with an involution , i.e. simply connected minimal complex surfaces of general type with and , that have an automorphism of order . there has been a growing interest for complex surfaces of general type with having an involution ; cf . j. keum - y . lee , calabri - ciliberto - mendes lopes , calabri - mendes lopes - pardini , y. lee - y . shin , rito . a classification of numerical godeaux surfaces ( i.e. minimal complex surfaces of general type with and ) with an involution is given in calabri - ciliberto - mendes lopes . it is known that the quotient surface of a numerical godeaux surface by its involution is either rational or birational to an enriques surface , and the bicanonical map of the numerical godeaux surface factors through the quotient map . however , the situation is more involved in the case of numerical campedelli surfaces , because the bicanonical map may not factor through the quotient map ; cf . calabri - mendes lopes - pardini . in particular it can happen that the quotient is of general type . more precisely , let be a numerical campedelli surface with an involution . if has only fixed points and no fixed divisors , then the minimal resolution of the quotient is a numerical godeaux surface and has only four fixed points ; cf . barlow . conversely , if is of general type , then has only four fixed points and no fixed divisors ; calabri - mendes lopes - pardini . there are some examples of numerical campedelli surfaces with an involution having only four fixed points . barlow constructed examples with . barlow also constructed examples with whose minimal resolution of the quotient by the involution is the first example of a simply connected numerical godeaux surface . also all catanese s surfaces have such an involution and . recently calabri , mendes lopes , and pardini constructed a numerical campedelli surface with torsion and two involutions . frapporti showed that there exists an involution having only four fixed points on the numerical campedelli surface with constructed first in bauer - catanese - grunewald - pignatelli . it is known that the orders of the algebraic fundamental groups of numerical campedelli surfaces are at most and the dihedral groups and can not be realized . recently , the existence question for numerical campedelli surfaces with was settled by the construction of examples with ; frapporti and h. park - j . shin . hence it would be an interesting problem to construct numerical campedelli surfaces having an involution with for each given group with . especially we are concerned with the simply connected case because the fundamental groups of all the known examples with an involution have large order : . furthermore the first example of simply connected numerical campedelli surfaces is very recent ( y. lee - j . park ) , but we have no information about the existence of an involution in their example . the main theorem of this paper is : there are simply connected minimal complex surfaces of general type with and which have an involution such that the minimal resolution of the quotient is a simply connected minimal complex surface of general type with and . we also show that the minimal resolution of the quotient has a local deformation space of dimension corresponding to deformations of such that its general fiber is the minimal resolution of a quotient of a numerical campedelli surface by an involution ; theorem . in addition , we show that the resolution should be always simply connected if the double cover is already simply connected ; proposition . conversely barlow showed that if the resolution is a simply connected numerical godeaux surface then the possible order of the algebraic fundamental group of the double cover is , , , , or . as far as we know , the example in barlow was the only one whose quotient is simply connected . it has as mentioned earlier . here we find an example with . hence it would be an intriguing problem in this context to construct an example with . in order to construct the examples , we combine a double covering and a -gorenstein smoothing method developed in y. lee - j . park . first we build singular surfaces by blowing up points and then contracting curves over a specific rational elliptic surface . these singular surfaces differ by contracting certain -curves . if we contract all of the -curves , we obtain a stable surface in the sense of kollr shepherd - barron , and we prove that the space of -gorenstein deformations of is smooth and dimensional ; proposition . a ( -gorenstein ) smoothing of in this space produces simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces . in particular , the smoothing of gives the existence of a two dimensional family of simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with six -curves ; corollary . we also prove that a four dimensional family in this space produces simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with a -divisible divisor consisting of four disjoint -curves ; theorem and theorem . these numerical godeaux surfaces are used to construct the numerical campedelli surfaces with an involution . the desired numerical campedelli surfaces are obtained by taking double coverings of the numerical godeaux surfaces branched along the four disjoint -curves ; theorem . on the other hand we can also obtain the campedelli family explicitly from a singular stable surface . it comes from blowing up points and contracting curves over a certain rational elliptic surface ; proposition . the -gorenstein space of deformations of is smooth and dimensional ; proposition . in both godeaux and campedelli cases we compute to show no local - to - global obstruction to deform them ; theorem and theorem . this involves a new technique ( theorem ) which generalizes a result of burns - wahl describing the space of first order deformations of a singular complex surface with only rational double points . a cyclic quotient singularity ( germ at of ) , where with a -th primitive root of , , and , is denoted by . means . a -curve ( or -curve ) in a smooth surface is an embedded with self - intersection ( respectively , ) . throughout this paper we use the same letter to denote a curve and its proper transform under a birational map . a singularity of class is a quotient singularity which admits a -gorenstein one parameter smoothing . they are either rational double points or with and ; see kollr shepherd - barron . for a normal variety its tangent sheaf is . the dimension of is . the authors would like to thank professor yongnam lee for helpful discussion during the work , careful reading of the draft version , and many valuable comments . the authors also wish to thank professor jenia tevelev for indicating a mistake in an earlier version of this paper , and the referee especially for the remark on the proof of proposition 3.7 which makes it simpler . heesang park was supported by basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( 2011 - 0012111 ) . dongsoo shin was supported by basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) grant funded by the korean government ( 2010 - 0002678 ) . giancarlo urza was supported by a fondecyt inicio grant funded by the chilean government ( 11110047 ) . in this section we construct a family of simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces having a -divisible divisor consisting of four disjoint -curves by smoothing a singular surface ; theorem . this is the key to construct numerical campedelli surfaces with an involution . in addition , we describe the explicit stable model of the singular surface . in fact , we construct a rational normal projective surface with four singularities , , , and ample . hence is a stable surface ( cf . kollr - shepherd - barron , hacking ) . we will prove that the versal -gorenstein deformation space ( cf . hacking ) is smooth and dimensional , and that the -gorenstein smoothings of are simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces . in particular , this shows that there are simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces whose canonical model has precisely two singularities ; corollary . furthermore a four dimensional family in produces the above simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with a -divisible divisor consisting of four disjoint -curves ; theorem and theorem . we start with a rational elliptic surface with an -singular fiber , an -singular fiber , and two nodal singular fibers . in fact we will use the same rational elliptic surface in the papers h. park - j . shin . however , we need to sketch the construction of to show the relevant curves that will be used to build the singular surfaces and . let , , , and be lines in and let be a smooth conic in given by the following equations . they intersect as in figure . we consider the pencil of cubics \\in ^1 \\}\\ ] ] generated by the two cubic curves and . this pencil has four base points , , , , and four singular members corresponding to = , , , ] and ] and the two nodes ] of and . since meets every member in the pencil at three points but it passes through only one base point , the proper transform of is a bisection of the elliptic fibration ; cf . figure . note that in . let be the class of the pull - back of a line in . we denote again by the class of the pull - back of the exceptional divisor . we have the following linear equivalences of divisors in : let . note that the divisor is -divisible because of the relation in the construction of , we use only one section . we first blow up at the two nodes of the nodal singular fibers and so that we obtain a blown - up rational elliptic surface ; figure . let and be the exceptional curves over the nodes of and , respectively . we further blow up at each three marked points in figure , and we blow up twice at the marked point ( that is , we first blow - up and then again on the intersection point of the section and the exceptional curve ; see figure ) . we then get as in figure . there exist two linear chains of the in whose dual graphs are given by : where consists of , , , , and contains , , . ] ] we construct rational singular surfaces which produce under -gorenstein smoothings simply connected surfaces of general type with and . we first contract the two chains and of s from the surface so that we have a normal projective surface with two singularities , of class : . denote the contraction morphism by . let be the surface obtained by contracting the four -curves in . we denote the contraction morphism by . then is also a normal projective surface with singularities , from , and four s ( ordinary double points ) , denoted by . we finally contract , , and in to obtain . it has the singularities , and two s . let be the contraction . in section we will prove that the obstruction spaces to local - to - global deformations of the singular surfaces , and vanish . that is : , , and . the singular surface is the stable model of the singular surfaces and : the surface has , , and is ample . the space is smooth and dimensional . a -gorenstein smoothing of is a simply connected canonical surface of general type with and . for a surface with only singularities of type we have where is the number of exceptional curves over and is the milnor number of . in our case , . we have because of the rationality of the singularities . we now compute in a -numerically effective way . let be the general fiber of the elliptic fibration in . let , , be the exceptional curves over , , respectively . let , be the exceptional curves over with . then , . we also have . writing in and adding the discrepancies from and , we obtain we now intersect with all the curves in its support , which are not contracted by , to check that is nef . moreover , if for a curve not contracted by , then is a component of a fiber in the elliptic fibration which does not intersect any curve in the support . this is because , , , and belong to the support , and they are the components of a fiber . one easily checks that does not exist , proving that is ample . therefore any -gorenstein smoothing of over a ( small ) disk will produce canonical surfaces ; cf . kollr - mori . to compute the fundamental group of a -gorenstein smoothing we use the recipe in y. lee - j . we follow the argument as in y. lee - j . consider the normal circles around and . we can compare them through the transversal sphere . since the orders of the circles are and , which are coprime , we obtain that both end up being trivial . the smoothness of follows from theorem and hacking . to compute the dimension , we observe that if is a -gorenstein smoothing of and is the dual of , then restricts to as ( tangent bundle of ) when , and with cokernel supported at the singular points of ; cf . wahl . then the flatness of and semicontinuity in cohomology plus the fact that gives for any . but then , since is of general type , hirzebruch - riemann - roch theorem says this proves the claim . there is a two dimensional family of simply connected canonical numerical godeaux surfaces with two singularities . we consider the sequence at the end of hacking . we just proved that is dimensional , and we know that is dimensional , since each gives dimensions and each gives dimension . therefore . to produce the claimed family we need to smooth up at the same time and . a simply connected numerical godeaux surfaces with a -divisible divisor consisting of four disjoint -curves is obtained from a -gorenstein smoothing of the singular surface : a. there is a -gorenstein smoothing over a disk with central fiber and an effective divisor such that the restriction to a fiber over is -divisible in consisting of four disjoint -curves and . b. there is a -gorenstein deformation of with central fiber such that a fiber over has four ordinary double points as its only singularities and the minimal resolution of is the corresponding fiber of . we apply a similar method in y. lee - j . park . since any local deformations of the singularities of can be globalized by theorem , there are -gorenstein deformations of over a disk which keep all four ordinary double points and smooth up and . let be such deformation , with as its central fiber , and  a normal projective surface with four s as its only singularities . we resolve simultaneously these four singularities in each fiber . we then get a family that is a -gorenstein smoothing of the central fiber , which shows that a -gorenstein smoothing of can be lifted to a -gorenstein smoothing of the pair , i.e. the -divisible divisor on is extended to an effective divisor . we finally show that the effective divisor is 2-divisible in for . according to manetti ( * ? ? ? * lemma 2 ) , the natural restriction map is injective for every and bijective for . here we are using that . since the divisor is nonsingular , is also nonsingular . since in , it follows that , where is extended to a line bundle and is the corresponding restriction . the main purpose of this section is to construct simply connected numerical campedelli surfaces with an involution . along the way , we will introduce a rational normal projective surface with singularities ( two , two , and two ) and ample . a certain four dimensional -gorenstein deformation of will produce numerical campedelli surfaces with an involution . recall that the rational surface has a -divisible divisor ; cf . . let be the double cover of branched along the divisor , where the double cover is given by the data , . we denote the double covering by . the surface has two s and two s . on the other hand the surface can be obtained from a certain rational elliptic surface by blowing - ups , as we now explain . the morphism blows down to a double cover branched along . the ramification divisor consists of four disjoint -curves . we blow down them from to obtain a surface ; cf . figure . in figure the pull - back of the are the , of the curve is , of the section is , and of the double section is . each in is the pull - back of each in . ] note that the surface has an elliptic fibration structure with two -singular fibers and two -singular fibers . in fact , the surface can be obtained from the pencil of cubics in \\in ^1 \\}\\ ] ] where the -singular fibers come from and , and the -singular fibers come from and . the two double sections and are defined by the lines and . in summary : the surface is the blow - up at four nodes of one -singular fiber of the rational elliptic fibration . hence the surface can be obtained from by blowing - up in the obvious way . let be the double cover of the singular surface branched along the divisor . note that the surface is a normal projective surface with four singularities of class whose resolution graphs consist of two s and two s . the ramification divisor in consists of the four disjoint -curves . let be the double covering . on the other hand the surface can be obtained from the rational surface by contracting the two s and two s . let be the contraction morphism . let be the surface obtained by blowing down the four -curves from . we denote the blowing - down morphism by . then there is a double covering branched along the four ordinary double points . finally , let be the contraction of the -curves and in . let be the contraction . we then get a double covering . to sum up , we have the following commutative diagram : \\ar^{\\psi ' } & v \\ar \\ar^{\\psi } \\ar^{ } & \\ar^{ } \\ar^{\\beta } & x \\ar^{\\phi } \\ar & x ' \\ar\\\\ & e(1 ) & \\ar z \\ar^{ } & \\ar^{\\alpha } & y \\ar & y'}\\ ] ] we will show in section the obstruction spaces to local - to - global deformations of the singular surfaces , and vanish : , , and . the singular surface is the stable model of and : the surface has , , and ample . the space is smooth and dimensional . a -gorenstein smoothing of is a simply connected canonical surface of general type with and . the proof goes as the one for in proposition , using the explicit model we have for by blowing - up in proposition . one can check that an intersection computation as in proposition verifies ampleness for . the proof of the next main result follows easily from theorem . there exist -gorenstein smoothings of and of that are compatible with the -gorenstein deformations of of and of in theorem , respectively ; that is , the double coverings and extend to the double coverings and between the fibers of the -gorenstein deformations . by theorem , the obstruction to local - to - global deformations of the singular surface vanishes . the point of the above theorem is that there is a -gorenstein smoothing of the cover that is compatible with the -gorenstein deformation of the base . a general fiber of the -gorenstein smoothing of is a simply connected numerical campedelli surface with an involution such that the minimal resolution of the quotient is a simply connected numerical godeaux surface . let be a minimal complex surface of general type with and . suppose that the group acts on with just fixed points . let be the quotient and let be the minimal resolution of . barlow ( * ? ? ? * proposition 1.3 ) proved that if then . conversely : if is simply connected , then so is . let be the quotient map . then is a double covering which is branched along the four ordinary double points of . let be the complement of the four branch points ( i.e. , the four -singularities ) of and let , that is , is the complement of the four fixed points of the involution . then we get an tale double covering . since , we have . note that the boundary of an arbitrary small neighborhood of one of the four nodes of is a lens space . let ] . then it follows by van kampen theorem that is trivial . hence is trivial because is obtained from by resolving only four -singularities . in this section we prove theorem which says that the obstruction spaces to local - to - global deformations of the singular surfaces , , and vanish . that is , we will prove that . at the end , we also prove the analogues , theorem , for , , and . at first the vanishing of the obstruction spaces of a singular surface can be proved by the vanishing of the second cohomologies of a certain logarithmic tangent sheaf on the minimal resolution of the singular surface : if be the minimal resolution of a normal projective surface with only quotient singularities , and is the reduced exceptional divisor of the resolution , then . let be a nonsingular surface and let be a simple normal crossing divisor in . let be the blow - up of at a point of . let . then . we can add or remove disjoint -curves . let be a nonsingular surface and let be a simple normal crossing divisor in . let be a -curve in such that is again simple normal crossing . then . we can also add or remove disjoint exceptional divisors of rational double points . the following theorem may give a new general way to prove unobstructedness for deformations of surfaces . let be a normal projective surface with only rational double points as singularities . let be the minimal resolution of with exceptional reduced divisor . let be a simple normal crossing divisor such that . then . let and be the prime decompositions of and . we have three short exact sequences : we then have the following commutative diagram of cohomologies : & 0 \\ar & & \\\\ 0 \\ar & h^1(}}(-\\log(c+m ) ) ) \\ar \\ar & h^1(}}(- ) ) \\ar^{\\phi } \\ar^{\\xi } & \\oplus h^1( } } } ) \\ar@{=} & \\\\ 0 \\ar & h^1(}}(- ) ) \\ar \\ar & h^1( } } ) \\ar^{\\psi } \\ar^{\\zeta } & \\oplus h^1( } } } ) \\ar & 0\\\\ & \\oplus h^1( } } } ) \\ar@{=} & \\oplus h^1( } } } ) & & } } \\ ] ] here all horizontal and vertical sequences are exact . especially the second row is a short exact sequence , which we explain now briefly : it is shown in burns - wahl ( see also wahl ) that the composition is an isomorphism because the s are rational double points ; hence , one has a direct sum decomposition and an isomorphism . therefore the second row is exact . in order to prove the assertion , it is enough to show that is surjective . let . since is surjective , we have for some . by we have for some and such that is mapped to under the composition . since is supported on and , its image under vanishes . therefore , and so for some ;

hence , the map is injective . therefore the claim follows . let . by theorem we have we use propositions and to obtain where . in this way , it follows by the above claim that then , by proposition , we have . notice we can modify to obtain vanishing for and as well . we now prove that . we will use our explicit model of in proposition . the proof goes along the same lines as the proof of the above theorem . we may only need to mention that we start with the elliptic fibration , and fibers ( instead of s ) . the involution of a general fiber induced by the double covering extends to a -action on the deformation space of . we will count the dimension of the subspace of which is fixed by the -action ;

{"article": "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model . this symmetry solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the gut scale . it also predicts the existence of superpartner of the standard model ( sm ) particles . from the naturalness argument , their masses should be below tev range , hence these particles will be discovered at tevatron or large hadron collider ( lhc ) . mechanisms of susy breaking and its mediation to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sector are one of the most important problems in the susy phenomenology . in many models , this dynamics is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak(ew ) scale , e.g. , gut scale or planck scale . once the mechanism is specified , mass spectrum and flavor structure of susy particle at the ew scale can be determined by a small number of parameters . hence it may be possible to confirm or exclude the mechanism by direct search or flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) experiments in near future . if susy breaking is mediated by gravity , the structure of susy breaking masses of scalars are determined by khler potential . in the present paper , we focus on the no - scale type khler potential , in which the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated as follows : where and are hidden sector fields and observable sector fields , respectively . this type of khler potential is originally investigated in ref . with and . characteristic features of the khler potential eq. is that all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings ( a - terms ) vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes . the only source of susy breaking is gaugino masses . hence this scenario is highly predictive , various phenomenological consequences are obtained with a few parameters . the separation in eq. implies that couplings of the hidden sector and the observable sector is flavor blind , and contributions of susy particles to fcnc are suppressed . therefore this khler potential is also interesting from the viewpoint of the susy flavor problem . the no - scale structure of the khler potential is obtained in various models . it has been shown that in some classes of string theory , for example weakly coupled heterotic string theory , khler potential becomes the no - scale type . if the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated in the superspace density in the supergravity lagrangian , the khler potential is indeed given as in eq .  . in the two cases , the gaugino masses can be induced if the hidden sector fields couple to the gauge multiplets via the gauge kinetic function . recently it has been pointed out that the form eq. is realized naturally in a five - dimensional setting with two branes , namely , sequestered sector scenario . in this scenario , the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other . it has been shown that the form of the khler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed eq. . if the sm gauge fields dwell in the bulk , gaugino mediate the susy breaking on the hidden sector brane to the visible sector brane and the no - scale boundary condition is given at the compactification scale of the fifth dimension ( gaugino mediation ) . in the no - scale scenario , degrees of freedom of susy particle mass spectrum is limited because only non - zero soft susy breaking masses are gaugino masses and higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given . hence phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated in the literature , mainly focusing on the mass spectrum . direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint ( i.e. , a charged particle can not be the lsp if the r - parity is conserved ) were considered and allowed region in the parameter space was identified . for the boundary condition , the following three cases were considered . first , universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . in this case , the cosmological constraint is severe and only the region and is allowed since stau tends to be light . the second case is that universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . and the third case is that non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . in this case wino , higgsino or sneutrino can be the lsp . in the latter two cases , it is shown that the cosmological constraint is not severer than the first case . in the present paper , current limits from the lightest higgs mass and the branching ratio for are also used to constrain the no - scale scenario . combining these constraints , we will show that almost all the parameter region is excluded when universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . however , when the boundary condition is given above the gut scale , relatively large parameter region is allowed . we also consider the case that the non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . we will show that these constraints are important when the higgsino - like neutralino is the lsp . this paper is organized as follows . in section , we review some phenomenological aspects of the no - scale models , especially indications of the direct search bounds and the cosmological bound . in section , we further constrain these models from the higgs mass bound and result . indications of these bounds for the tevatron are also discussed . our conclusions are given in section . in this section , we briefly review phenomenological aspects of susy models with no - scale boundary condition , mainly indications of the cosmological bound and direct search limit at lep 2 . we consider the following three cases . * universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . hereafter we call this case the minimal scenario . * universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . throughout this paper , we take the minimal su(5 ) to be the theory above the gut scale as a typical example . * non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . once one of the above boundary conditions is given , mass spectrum of susy particles at the ew scale and their contributions to fcnc can be calculated . in this paper we solve the one - loop level rges to obtain the soft susy breaking mass parameters at the ew scale . the higgsino mass parameter is determined by potential minimum condition at the one - loop level . first , we discuss the minimal scenario . in this case , the following boundary condition is given at the gut scale , where is the common scalar mass and is universal trilinear scalar coupling . with this boundary condition , bino and right - handed sleptons are lighter than other susy particles . their masses are approximately , from eq. we see that the charged right - handed slepton is the lsp if the d - term is negligible , i.e. , . hence this parameter region is excluded by the cosmological consideration . on the other hand , lep 2 experiments yields the upper bound on the cross section for smuon pair production , for and , so the parameter region is excluded in fig . and , allowed region of the parameter space are shown in the plane . the regions above the dash - dotted line and the left side of the dash - dot - dotted line are excluded by cosmological bound and lep 2 bound on smuon pair production , respectively . therefore the minimal scenario is constrained severely . next we see the case that the universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . in the minimal su(5 ) case , the right - handed slepton belongs to 10-plet , so the large group factor makes slepton masses heavier . for example , when the bino mass and the right - handed slepton mass at the weak scale are approximately given , hence the cosmological constraint is not severe because the stau mass is large enough and neutralino is the lsp in the large parameter region . in the fig. and , the same figures as in the fig. and are shown . unlike in the minimal case , the stau search bound at lep is also plotted because mass difference between and is larger than in the minimal case and it can be stronger than the smuon search . from these figures we see that the lsp is avoided unless is larger than about 20 . the charged stau lsp can also be avoided if gaugino masses at the gut scale are non - universal , i.e. , the following boundary condition is given , this boundary condition can be given naturally within the gut framework . in this case , not only bino - like neutralino , but also wino - like , higgsino - like neutralino or sneutrino can be the lsp . for and , the lsp is wino - like neutralino . for example , when and , then wino mass and charged slepton mass are ( notice that in this case the left - handed sleptons are lighter than right - handed sleptons ) ; the higgsino is the lsp if . for example , when and , then the higgsino mass and the right - handed slepton mass are in the two cases given above , neutral wino or higgsino is the lsp . in fact from fig. - we find that neural particle is the lsp in large parameter region , thus it is cosmologically viable . in the previous section we take into account only lep 2 bound and the cosmological constraint . we find that the minimal scenario is severely constrained , but the other two scenarios are not . in this section we also include the current higgs mass bound and constraint . as we will see , combining the above four constraint , not only the minimal case but also the other two scenarios can be constrained more severely . we also discuss the possibility whether this scenario can be seen at the tevatron run 2 or not . before we show the numerical results , some remarks on our calculation of the higgs mass and are in order . it is well known that radiative correction is important when the lightest higgs mass is evaluated . in the present paper , the lightest higgs mass is evaluated by means of the one - loop level effective potential . this potential is evaluated at the renormalization point of the geometrical mean of the two stop mass eigenvalues . we compared our result with a two - loop result by using feynhiggs , and checked that the difference between these two results is smaller than 5 gev as long as is bigger than 5 . when is close to 2 , the difference can be 7 gev . however , as we will see later , higgs mass bound plays an important rule around . and the two - loop effects always make the higgs mass lighter than that obtained at the one - loop level . so our conclusion is conservative and is not significantly changed by the two - loop effect . we exclude the parameter region where the lightest higgs mass is lighter than the current 95% c.l . limit from lep 2 experiments , . in the present paper , is calculated including leading order ( lo ) qcd corrections , and compare it to the current cleo measurement . in the mssm , chargino contribution can be comparable to the sm and charged higgs contributions . they interfere constructively ( destructively ) each other when  . the difference between the lo and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) result can be sizable only when cancellation among different contributions at the lo is spoiled by the nlo contributions . as we will see , however , the constraint is severe when the interference is constructive . in the case of destructive interference where the deviation from the nlo result may be large , this constraint is not so important . hence we expect that our conclusion is not changed significantly by the inclusion of the nlo corrections . for the experimental value , we use 95% c.l . limit from cleo , . first we show the numerical results for the minimal case . the case for is shown in fig. . in this case , for small region , the stop mass is not so large that radiative correction factor which raises the higgs mass is small . ( for example , gev and gev for gev and ) . hence the higgs mass limit constrains this scenario severely . in fig. , the higgs mass bound and constraints in the plane are shown . the regions below the solid line and above the dashed line are excluded by the higgs mass and bound , respectively . the indication of reported by lep 2 is also shown in this figure . from the figure we find that the higgs mass bound almost excludes the region where the stau lsp is avoided . note that , as we discussed earlier , the bound we put on the higgs mass may be conservative , because the two loop correction may further reduce the higgs mass . the same figure but for is shown in fig. . now also constrains parameter region strongly since chargino contribution to interferes with sm and charged higgs ones constructively . the region above the dashed line is excluded by constraint . we find that only one of the two constraints is enough to exclude all the region where cosmological bound and the smuon mass bound are avoided . hence if r - parity is conserved , i.e. , the cosmological bound is relevant , this scenario with is excluded . next we show the numerical results in the case that the cutoff scale is larger than the gut scale . as a typical example , we choose the minimal su(5 ) as the theory above the gut scale . in fig. and , results are shown for positive and negative , respectively . in both figures , we take gev . for case , large parameter region is allowed and susy scale can be as small as about 180 gev , which indicates the lsp mass gev . for , as in the minimal case , constraint is severer , and must be larger than around 280 gev . we also considered other values of the boundary scale from to , and checked that the behavior of the contour plot does not change so much . according to ref. , tevatron run 2 experiment can explore up to gev for integrated luminosity . hence if and , susy particles can be discovered at the experiment . in this range , trilepton from chargino - neutralino associated production , , is one of clean signals for susy search . notice that now two body decay opens . so same flavor , opposite sign dilepton from decay may be useful . the two body decay allows us to observe the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the . it is expressed in terms of the neutralino masses and the slepton mass as , in table , the dependence of on is shown . here we fix . notice that as changes , the right - handed mass changes sizably while the neutralino masses do not . hence we can obtain the mass relation among them and also cutoff scale , which corresponds to the compactification scale in the sequestered sector scenario , by measuring . on the other hand , since only gev is allowed for , the tevatron run 2 can not survey this scenario , and we have to wait lhc experiment . next , we turn to the case that gaugino masses are non - universal at the gut scale . we explore the following three cases , wino - like neutralino lsp , higgsino - like neutralino lsp and the tau sneutrino lsp . we will see that in the wino - like neutralino lsp and tau sneutrino lsp cases , constraint is not so severe even if we combine higgs mass bound and data , but in the higgsino - like lsp case where stops are as light as sleptons and charginos , the predicted higgs mass tends to be small , and thus the higgs mass bound becomes important . first , we discuss the wino - lsp case . the results for , are shown in fig. and fig. , for and , respectively . in this case , we obtain a relatively large higgs mass since is large and so are the masses of stops . hence , for , can be as small as 100 gev at , where the mass of the lsp is about 90 gev . for , though constraint is slightly severer than in the case , is allowed , which corresponds to . hence the wino - lsp with mass around 100 gev is allowed . examples of the mass spectrum in this case are listed as point a  and point b  in table . at the both points , is chosen to be near the smallest value such that all constraints are avoided . in general , however , masses of and are highly degenerate when wino is the lsp . in fact , from table , we see that the mass difference is less than 1 gev . therefore a lepton from is very soft and trilepton signal search is not useful because acceptance cut usually requires the smallest transverse momentum of the three leptons to be larger than 5 gev . recently collider phenomenology in such cases are studied in ref . it is shown that certain range of and , susy signals which are different from those in the minimal case can be detected . the high degeneracy requires to include radiative corrections to calculate , which is beyond of this work . it deserves detail study to estimate the mass difference in the scenario . since the constraint for the sneutrino lsp case in the plane is similar to those in the wino - lsp case , we show the result for only in fig. . in the figure , we take and . notice that the decomposition of the lsp depends on and the sneutrino is the lsp for . an example of the mass spectrum is listed as the point c in table . in this case , trilepton signal comes from , , . since , of a lepton from decay is small and this signal may be hard to be detected . we may need unusual trigger to explore this scenario . next , we turn to the higgsino lsp case . higgsino lsp scenario is realized when is smaller than half of , which indicates that colored particles are lighter than in the universal gaugino mass case . hence the one - loop correction to the higgs potential which enhances the higgs mass is small and the higgs mass constraint is important . the same figures as fig. and are shown in fig.  and fig.  for and . in order to satisfy the higgs mass bound , must be larger than around 300 gev . combining the bound with , constraint becomes severer , especially for case where is required . example of mass spectrum in this scenario is listed as point d and e in table . again we choose almost the smallest value of where all constraints are avoided . we see that the lsp mass must be at least for and for . hence this scenario can not be explored at the tevatron run 2 . the no - scale type boundary conditions are obtained in various types of susy models . this scenario is attractive because it is highly predictive and can be a solution to the susy flavor problem . in this paper we investigated the indication of the current higgs mass and constraint on susy models with the boundary condition . first we considered the minimal case where the universal gaugino mass are given at the gut scale . this scenario has been already constrained by direct search at lep and the cosmological bound severely , under the assumption of the exact r - parity . we showed that the higgs mass bound and constraint are also taken into account , then almost all the parameter region is excluded , leaving very narrow allowed region for . next we considered the case that the boundary condition is given above the gut scale . since the cosmological constraint is not severe , wide region of the parameter space is allowed . in the case , tevatron have a chance to observe susy signatures like trilepton events . the scale may be explored by measuring the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the . however for the case , since is required , we have to wait lhc . finally we considered the case where non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . we see that the higgs mass bound is strong in the higgsino lsp case because stop masses are as light as sleptons and charginos . the mass of the higgsino - like neutralino must be larger than about 245 gev and 370 gev for and , respectively . in the wino lsp and sneutrino lsp case , the mass of the lsp can be as small as 150 gev . however , the mass difference between the lsp and parent particles produced at the collider is much smaller than in the minimal case , unusual acceptance cut may be required . the author would like to thank m. yamaguchi for suggesting the subject , fruitful discussion and careful reading of the manuscript . he also thanks t. moroi and m. m. nojiri for useful discussion . j. ellis , c. kounnas and d.v . nanopoulos , nucl . b247 ( 1984 ) 373 ; j. ellis , a.b . lahanas , d.v . nanopoulos and k. tamvakis , phys . b134 ( 1984 ) 439 ; a.b . lahanas and d.v . nanopoulos , phys .

{"article": "the origin - destination ( od ) matrix is important in transportation analysis . the matrix contains information on the number of travellers that commute or the amount of freight shipped between different zones of a region . the od matrix is difficult and often costly to obtain by direct measurements / interviews or surveys , but by using incomplete traffic counts and other available information one may obtain a reasonable estimate . a particular application of the od matrix estimation is in the area of public transport . in order to improve their service , the responsible managers are looking for on - going evaluation of the passenger flow and the reasons that would influence this flow . this is typically the case for the city rail , sydney bus and sydney ferry organisations , which handle the public transport in the region around the city of sydney , australia . cityrail and co are handling a large number of stations ( wharfs , bus stops ) for trains ( buses and ferries ) across the state . they carry thousands of passengers every day , and periodically optimise the time - table schedule to best meet the changing demand . + + an ideal optimization of the schedule would consider the resources in trains , drivers , stations and passengers . while the primary informations ( trains , drivers , stations ) are known to cityrail and co , the number of passenger on each train between each station can not be deduced easily given their current passenger flow data collection processes . + + various approaches to estimating the od matrix using traffic counts have been developed and tested using traffic counts , or road traffic flows , . most of the papers in the literature solve this problem by postulating a general model for the trip distribution , for example a gravity type model , which aims at introducing a prior knowledge on the traffic flows and assigning a cost to each journey . then the inference is produced to estimate the parameters of this model . all these papers are not passengers oriented . + most of the work relating to od matrix estimation are based on passengers observations assuming the knowledge of where the people get in and out of the public transport . lo et al developed a framework centred on the passenger choice , which they called the random link choice , and model this to obtain a maximum likelihood estimator . nandi et al applied a strategy centred on a fixed cost per person per kilometre assumption on the air - route network of india and provide some comparisons with the real data . + when the information is not available ( for example we have no data on when passengers get off the bus ) , kostakos offers to use a wireless detection of the passengers trips , and lundgren and peterson s model is based on a target od - matrix previously defined . however , none of the cited work considered using survey data . indeed , if no complete information is available about the passengers destinations , the simplest solution is to use an appropriate survey to estimate destination information . furthermore , what characteristics of the survey are required for the estimation to be accurate ? bierliaire and toint introduces a structure - based estimation of the origin - destination matrix based on parking surveys . in their article , they used the parking surveys to infer an a priori estimate of the od matrix , and they used this prior in coordination with the partial observations of the network flows to derive a generalized least square estimator of the od matrix . despite its novelty , this article assume that the behaviour of car - user and public transport users are the same , at least regarding their respective od matrix . given that the public transport network topology is often different from the road network topology , one may doubt the accuracy of this assumption . moreover , they just use the partial structure extracted from the surveys . + the purpose of this paper is then to develop an estimation procedure for the origin - destination matrix based on the ticket records available for the transport network and/or on previous surveys . unlike the article from bierliaire , we use survey data collection from public transport users , and estimate the approximate whole matrix structure through the estimation of its eigenvectors . we propose a robust version of the estimator to avoid biases induced by the survey . we also construct a regression estimation procedure that accounts for the influence of exogenous variable such as the weather conditions or the time of the year . + we first briefly present the passenger model , and then move on to outlining the observations model . in section , we explain how the measurements are obtained , and what measurements error should be expected . in section , we explain the assumptions we make on the measurements , and how this affects our estimation procedure . we present in section the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation procedure , by providing a system of equation to be solved , for deriving estimators . we improve on this ml estimation to make it robust to survey biases in section . finally , we present a simulation example and an application to a real world case in section . we finally comment on the results and outline some future research opportunities . let be the matrix of passengers number between the stations in the rail network over time period so that is the number of passengers who depart from station and arrive at station at time period . given that there is an obvious time dependency here , denoted by the period in which the commuting occur ( for example a day ) . the purpose of this work is to provide an estimation of given the observations specified in section . the observations provided about the passengers are very different , and only considering them all allow a direct estimation of . we list in the subsections , and the different kind of observations . a casual commuter is defined as a single or return journey that is not repeated regularly ( e.g. daily ) . typically , people going to a once - in - a - year event will buy their ticket for that trajectory and will probably return on the same day . accordingly for single and day return tickets , we have complete information under the assumption that they take the next train after purchasing their ticket and that they take the shortest route . let be that matrix of measurements . each journey between major stations , the passenger has to validate his ticket through the machines at the entrance of the station , and do it again at the exit . between minor stations we assume they take the next train to arrive at the station they purchased their ticket at and assume they take the trio planners recommended route for that time . two scenarios are considered . in the first one , ( called ) , every station in the network have these machines . in the second case ( called ) only major stations have these machines . in any case , let call the vector corresponding to the departures at the stations , and the vector of arrivals . fortunately we can have regular passengers with specific departure and destination , and this matrix will be denoted , where the rows stand for the departure stations and the columns for the arrival stations . this matrix is observed , and assumed distributed according to a poisson probability function with mean . + the main part of the information , however , remains unknown . indeed most of the passengers will probably have a zone ticket for a period of time , from 1 week to 1 year . the nature of these tickets make the station of departure and arrival unknown , and is the main challenge of this paper . let call the matrix of zone passengers numbers . + to make a proper statistical inference , we need two assumptions ; * the traveller will act independently of the validity duration of his ticket ; * the regular traveller commits to a return journey on each working day . the observations linked to this model are two - folds . for major stations , we have the total number of passengers that crossed the boom gates , in and out . for stations without boom gates , the observations have to estimated using a survey . we also have access to the total number of people with a valid zone ticket at time ( e.g. the day of the analysis ) , denoted , in the end , the total number of regular passenger at the time period will be denoted , and we have , with these very different observations , we need a good fitting model based on reasonable assumptions . sections , , and presents these assumptions for each parameter in our model . recall that is a matrix of count , the main assumption on that matrix is that the number of passenger is the sum of the casual passengers  plus the regular passengers  plus a matrix stating the unusual big events such as major sporting events , or large concerts ( called ) , the casual commuter journey could be assumed to be poisson distributed i.e. is supposed to be drawn with a poisson distribution which parameter belong to the matrix . ] where is the matrix of means for the counts . + however , the variance of the counts are not expected to be equal to their mean and so the poisson counts assumption may be unrealistic . therefore , we decided to use a negative binomial regression model for , which can be over - dispersed in order to better describe the distribution of the counts . we specify that is distributed according to a gamma distribution , . for a purpose of simplicity , let be distributed as negative binomial with parameters and ( we will denote ) . according to the definition of the measurements , the following relationships hold : where and are the vectors of the total number of departures and arrivals at each station during time period . for the same reasons as described for the casual matrix , we will use a negative binomial distribution to model the uncertainty around the regular traveller s information . however , unlike the casual commuter , we do not suspect an over - dispersion but an under - dispersion , so that , and . let and be the expectation of and . when the model is well defined , the estimation procedure is computationally straight forward , e.g. , between major stations where we have complete information of arrivals and departures . meaning that the maximum likelihood estimation method accuracy , practically depends on the efficient solving of the optimization problem . in this section , the stationary model parameters are estimated from the data . since the process is unlikely to be stationary , we present a second option ( section ) , a multivariate spatio - temporal model that we expect to fit the data better . the estimation procedure will be carried out in well - defined steps . if we ignore the time dependence , the successive observations can be considered independent , identical random counts from negative binomial or poisson distribution . this means that simple maximum likelihood estimation should work well , especially for large sample sizes . we observe for several realizations . given no space - time dependencies we assume that is independently distributed as . the likelihood is then , \\ ] ] where stands for one element of the matrix . we thus can estimate the parameters through , despite the absence of closed form solution to this problem , the optimization algorithms can quickly lead to a global maximum . unfortunately we do nt have complete information for those with weekly , monthly , quarterly or anuual tickets ( long - term tickets ) . we have information of the times they enter and departs at major stations but we do nt have complete information for the long term tickets either to or from minor stations . our assumption here is that only a proportion of the people will travel on day , where . is an additional parameter that reflects the passengers habit . it does exist because when performing the estimation , one may find a bigger estimation of travellers than what is observed . some of the difference is due to the randomness of , but it might also be explained by the fact that travellers with prepaid long term tickets will not necessary travel each of the working day of the week . + however , we may provide the same estimation for the parameters as we did in the previous section , that is , where stands for the same likelihood function as above . + this leads us to the final estimation , the contribution this paper makes to the literature . the aim is to estimate the matrix with the available departure and arrival data . the first step is to estimate the general shape of the matrix . the problem is to achieve this in a simple way given that is to be estimated with parameters , and only equations . the following paragraph presents an elegant solution to this problem . + recall as the expectation of . it is assumed symmetric , we can diagonalize it , so that , where is a projection matrix of eigenvectors of and is a diagonal matrix , with terms equal to the respective eigenvalues . therefore , if the structure of is known ( i.e. the eigenvectors are known ) and constant , then we have reduced the problem to solving a system of unknown parameters with equations . and the previous estimations , we have the following system , where and are obtained by simple subtraction . the probability density function of the observations can then be written , \\quad p \\big ( y {di}^t \\vert r z , p {rz } \\big ) & \\sim & ( \\sum j r^{ij} z , p {rz})\\ ] ] where and . according to this equation , we then have likelihood equations ( ] , \\ ] ] most of the optimization algorithms that deal with the constraint require an initialization which belong to the constrained space . one could be tempted to address as a starting point the mean value of the observations , according to the one - dimensional  result . however , it is very unlikely that this initial point will satisfy the constraints . therefore , the best choice so far seems to be the diagonal elements of the matrix , given that they naturally fill * constraint 1 * and * constraint 2*. + + the complete optimization program therefore becomes , with the initial value . this optimization program can be replaced by an explicit expression of the estimator , subject to some constraints stated in . the main constraint is the poisson distribution assumption , so that we have , + * proposition 1 : * assume that , then ^{-1 } \\ ] ] where is the matrix of estimated eigenvalues of . + if now we consider a gaussian likelihood instead of poisson , the following maximum likelihood estimator is found , + * proposition 2 : * assume that , then where is the matrix of estimated eigenvalues of . + the proofs of propositions 1 and 2 are presented in . we can also derive the follwing theorem , that ensures us of the quality of the estimation , + * theorem 1 * + assume that {\\ a.s.\\ } p ] stands for the scale of the survey , ] . then , and we have , where stands for the probability density function of . + the first integral decreases towards as grows to infinity according to eq . . the argument for the second integral is the following . according to the assumption of strong convergence of , converge towards the dirac function as goes to infinity . being strictly positive , this ends the proof . . ] * calculation in case of poisson regression ( and log link function ) * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the beginning of the reasoning is similar to the previous one . then , if we assume that exogenous variables have impacts on the number of passengers , we can write , where are symmetric matrices reflecting the intercept  for baseline commuter flows and the variable influences  for changes in commuter flows from known daily influences . moreover , we assume that the same diagonalization ( meaning with the same eigenvectors ) can be applied , which lead us to , therefore , will be distributed according to a poisson distribution with the following parameter , where the parameters to be estimated are , which means we have to estimate parameters . + the probability of one observation can then be written , which gives the following log -

{"article": "high q cavities such as whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) cavities have recently demonstrated quality factors  as high as and have shown the potential to reach even higher q values . however , there are difficulties in measurement of the linewidth and q of such high q cavities . while in theory , the q factor could be as high as and is limited only by rayleigh scattering , in practice , it is limited by other losses in the cavity . they include absorption and scattering losses due to impurities in the cavity material , and light - induced losses due to nonlinear processes . due to the extremely small mode volume and high q - factor of the cavity , the cavity build - up intensity is extremely high , even in the case of an input with small power ( as small as several mw ) . such a high resonator intensity leads to very efficient nonlinear processes inside wgm cavities , such as raman scattering , second harmonic generation , and four - wave mixing . whereas this is beneficial in many applications , it causes additional losses in the cavity and thus makes the q factor measurement unreliable ( at least , making it power - dependent ) . squeezed states of vacuum or light have been used in many applications such as improvement in interferometric and absorption measurements , for quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography , and for quantum imaging . however , to the best of our knowledge , no experiment for measurements of cavity parameters by use of squeezing has yet been reported . in this paper we propose and demonstrate an alternative method of measuring q factors by use of a squeezed vacuum field which is equivalent to a field with correlated quantum sidebands . this technique is advantageous over traditional optical methods in that it utilizes the injection of squeezed vacuum into a test cavity not to excite any nonlinear processes in the cavity . when the input field is detuned from the cavity resonance frequency , it transmits only the upper or lower quantum sidebands within the cavity linewidth while reflecting the counterparts ( associated upper or lower sidebands ) and all the other sidebands . the linewidth of the cavity can then be measured by observing the destruction of the correlation between the upper and lower quantum sidebands with respect to the carrier frequency . we show that the linewidth and q factor of a test cavity using the method agrees with those measured by traditional optical methods . this paper is organized as follows : in sec . , we describe the theoretical framework for the measurement method . in sec . , we explain the validity of the use of squeezed vacuum as a probe for non - invasive measurements and compare the technique to using a classical state . in sec . , we demonstrate the method using a test cavity with known cavity parameters and compare the parameter values obtained by the new method and the traditional optical methods . the conclusions of the paper are summarized in sec . . consider a squeezed vacuum field with carrier and sideband frequencies , and respectively . as shown in fig . , when the upper sideband of the squeezed vacuum field is injected into an optical cavity with resonance frequency and mirror reflectivities , and , the reflected field and its adjoint are given in terms of and its adjoint by where is the frequency -

matched input amplitude and phase quadrature variances and to be \\left({cc } 1\\\\1 \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\eta m ( 1-r m^2 ) \\left({cc } 1 \\\\ 1 \\right ) + \\eta l \\left({cc } 1 \\\\ 1 \\right),\\ ] ] where and are the composite efficiencies of detection associated with the cavity -

coupled reflected field is composed of the uncorrelated sidebands within the linewidth and the reflected correlated sidebands outside of it . the consequence is the destruction of the correlation within the linewidth between the upper and lower quantum sidebands . this is analogous to the destruction of the correlation between electro - optically modulated coherent sidebands in pairs , in which the beat between the carrier and the upper or lower sideband can be measured only when either sideband is absorbed into the cavity , reflecting the carrier and other sideband . the beat could not be observed if all the fields were reflected . similar measurements could be done with the transmission of the squeezed vacuum field through the cavity . however , the signal - to - noise ratio would not be as good as in the reflection method because the background of the transmission signal is shot noise . it is convenient to define the test cavity linewidth , the quality factor , and the finesse , as \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & }{\\pi(r 1 r 2 r 3)^{1/4}}\\,\\omega {\\rm fsr},\\ ] ] and respectively . the approximations made in eqs . and are valid for high q cavities . , , , and will be treated as free fitting parameters . we also assume the input mirror is lossless such that . since we are interested in having as little light ( at the carrier frequency ) as possible in the test cavity , it is instructive to calculate the average photon number in the field we use . the average photon number in squeezed light with squeeze factor and squeeze angle is given by where is the coherent amplitude of the light . as the number of coherent photons becomes zero  , resulting in squeezed vacuum , eq . becomes this is the average photon number in squeezed vacuum generated by squeezing . note that if the field is unsqueezed  , . for a squeeze factor of 1.5 corresponding to the squeezed or anti - squeezed level of db which is the current experimental limit , . therefore , it is fair to say that the optical influence of ideal squeezed vacuum on cavities is negligible . and are shown as solid and dashed curves , respectively , for different input states . ( a ) and ( b ) show the ( impure ) input state with db and db , in the absence of the cavity . ( c ) and ( d ) show the cavity - coupled response to the squeezed and anti - squeezed vacuum injection , respectively . ( e ) and ( f ) show the cavity - coupled response to injection of a classically noisy state with db , db . comparing ( e ) and ( c ) , we note that squeezing improves the signal contrast , but the classical noise and the anti - squeezed quadrature behave almost identically . ] similarly , it is instructive to compare this technique to using a classical state . for simplicity , assuming that the quadrature variance in both quadratures is frequency - independent , we consider the case in which the lower sideband is fully transmitted through an impedance - matched cavity and the upper sideband is fully reflected at the input mirror such that and at , respectively , which gives from eq . thus , the amplitude and phase quadrature variances of the reflected field are found to be in the absence of coherent light , the signal contrast can be defined as the quadrature variance at detuning frequency compared to the cavity - uncoupled quadrature variance at off - resonance frequencies  , in which case and , and the signal contrasts at the two orthogonal quadratures are respectively given by in the limiting case of and , we obtain we see that has about the same limiting level as in the classical case , while grows if gets smaller . classically , ( the shot noise limit ) , but using squeezed vacuum we can obtain , or improved signal contrast for a measurement in the squeezed quadrature . this is illustrated in fig . , where we compare the signal contrast for measurement of the cavity linewidth using a classical field with the signal contrast for squeezed field injection . the cavity - coupled responses of the classical and anti - squeezed quadrature variances behave almost identically in the case of the impedance - matched cavity , whereas squeezing improves the signal contrast of the measurement . it is important to note that even in the absence of technical noise , quadrature variance measurements are intrinsically contaminated by quantum noise itself . the standard deviation of the quadrature variances is given by thus , the noise of the measurement is proportional to the measured value itself , and many averages can be performed to achieve smaller uncertainty levels . this is different from the classical case where the parameters of a cavity are measured by measuring the transmission of a probe optical field incident on the cavity as a function of cavity detuning . in this case , the measurements are fundamentally limited by shot noise : the number of measured photons ( n ) has uncertainty proportional to . therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio grows as the number of the transmitted photons increases . mhz and mhz respectively . the squeezed vacuum generator is composed of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) and a second harmonic generator ( shg ) that pumps the opo . the cavity length is locked to the laser frequency by the pdh - locking servo and pzt ( pzt2 ) . the homodyne angle is locked by the noise - locking servo and pzt ( pzt1 ) . ] the experiment is schematically shown in fig . . the nd : yag laser ( lightwave model 126 ) gives an output of cw 700 mw at 1064 nm , which is injected into the squeezed vacuum generator ( squeezer ) . the squeezer is composed of a second harmonic generator ( shg ) and an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , both using 5 mgo : linbo nonlinear crystals placed within optical cavities ( hemilith for the shg and monolith for the opo ) in the type i phase - matching configuration . the shg pumped by the nd : yag laser generates 250 mw at 532 nm , which then pumps the opo below threshold with a vacuum seed . the resultant field generated by the opo is a squeezed vacuum field with a squeezing bandwidth of 66.2 mhz defined by the opo cavity linewidth . a sub - carrier field , frequency - shifted by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to a frequency that is coincident with the cavity tem mode , is injected into the other end of the opo cavity . the cavity is thus locked to the tem mode , offset by 220 mhz from the carrier frequency , using the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) locking technique . the frequency - shift is necessary to ensure that no cavity transmitted light at the fundamental frequency is injected into the opo cavity since it acts as a seed and degrades broadband squeezing due to the imperfect isolation of the faraday isolator . this is especially important for high q cavities with linewidths as narrow as khz because low - frequency squeezing is difficult to achieve . the squeezed vacuum is injected into a triangular test cavity with the fsr of 713 mhz and fwhm of khz , both measured by traditional methods using light . the frequency shift , of the subcarrier is mhz so that the carrier frequency is detuned from the tem mode by mhz . as a result of this frequency shift , only the upper sidebands are within the cavity linewidth , destroying the correlation between the upper and lower sidebands and , therefore , destroying the squeezing or anti - squeezing . this cavity - coupled squeezed vacuum reflection is measured by balanced homodyne detection , where the field to be measured interferes with a local oscillator ( lo ) field and is detected by two ( nearly ) identical photodetectors . the difference of the two photodetector signals is sent to an hp4195a spectrum analyzer ( sa ) to measure the noise variance of the squeezed or anti - squeezed quadrature . the results are shown in fig . . the experimental data are exponentially averaged 100 times . the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer is 100 khz . since the squeezed vacuum does not carry any coherent amplitude , the noise - locking technique is employed to lock the homodyne angle to either the squeezed or anti - squeezed quadrature at 2 mhz . khz . ] before fitting the experimental data points , the homodyne efficiencies and , and the quantum efficiency of the photo - detectors need to be taken into account . the sum of the homodyne efficiencies and the quantum efficiency were independently measured to be and respectively . the sum of the efficiencies in eq . is given by . we ignore since the cavity mode - matching efficiency is and hence , which yields . moreover , we have assumed that the input mirror m is lossless . this assumption is valid since it is a single - pass loss and does not influence the linewidth of the cavity . we then fit eq . to the measured data points with free parameters , , and ; both the data and the fits are shown in fig . . the resulting fitting values are , and mhz . therefore , the fwhm linewidth of the cavity is found to be khz , which agrees with the classically measured linewidth of the cavity within the uncertainty ( khz ) . we note that can be determined from the fit , but here we have used the optically measured value to estimate the linewidth . this is valid because any loss in the cavity does not change the fsr . we have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method for non - invasive measurements of optical cavity parameters by use of squeezed vacuum . the technique has the advantage over traditional optical methods that the injection of a squeezed vacuum field as a probe for cavity parameters does not excite any nonlinear processes in cavities , and is , therefore , useful for ultrahigh q cavities such as whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) cavities . we have shown that when a squeezed vacuum field is injected into a detuned cavity , the linewidth and factor of a test cavity can be determined by measuring the destruction of upper and lower quantum sidebands with respect to the carrier frequency . the linewidth of a test cavity is measured to be khz , which agrees with the classically measured linewidth of the cavity within the uncertainty ( khz ) . we have also show that the use of squeezed fields leads to better signal contrast , as expected . we would like to thank our colleagues at the ligo laboratory , especially thomas corbitt and christopher wipf , and stan whitcomb for his valuable comments on the manuscript . we gratefully acknowledge support from national science foundation grant nos . phy-0107417 and phy-0457264 .", "summary": "we propose and experimentally demonstrate a method for non -

{"article": "to enhance chemical reactivity of cu surfaces with nitrogen oxides ( no ) is an important issue for development of new catalytic materials effective in the no reduction process . the dissociative adsorption of no , for example , was found to be less expected on cu , compared with highly reactive rh , ir , ru , co , and ni surfaces , although dissociative adsorption was reported at finite temperatures in experiments . in order to provide active surfaces for no dissociation , cu thin films and low index surfaces were considered on one hand . in several electronic structure calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) , on the other hand , dissociative adsorption of no was found to be possible but energetically un - favored compared with molecular adsorption . we note that the simulations were often performed with respect to reactions on stable bulk surfaces . although the theoretical data suggested less reactivity of cu bulk surfaces for no reduction , there could be remarkable reactivity on some surface - like atomic structures of cu . when we considered wider classes of nano - scale structures other than defined surfaces of bulk cu crystals , one could find another clue . in this line of approach , indeed , many theoretical investigations with computer simulations had been done intending to explore efficiency of e.g. step - like structures of various metals . to explore possible no dissociation , we consider ultra thin cu structures . in this study , we focus on a cu atomic layer , that is the triangular lattice of cu . we adopted structural optimization simulations based on electronic structure calculations to find a stable cu triangular lattice ( cu - tl ) . on this thin structure , we adsorbed an no molecule and performed an optimization simulation . after finding molecular adsorbed structures , we searched possible dissociative adsorption on the cu structures . to find a possible reaction path and to conclude a reduction process , we performed simulations for reaction path estimation . in the discussion of this paper , by comparing the obtained adsorption energies with each other , we will discuss a possible no reduction mechanism by using cu nano - structures . we adopted the electronic structure calculation based on the density functional theory to estimate the electronic state , and to obtain inter - atomic forces . in this simulation , the kohn - sham wavefunctions were expanded in the plane - waves and the electron charge density was given both on a real space mesh and on the fourier mesh . an approximation for the exchange - correlation energy functional by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof in the scheme of the generalized gradient approximation was adopted . the ultra - soft pseudo - potential was utilized to describe the valence electron state . all of our simulations were done using the simulation package , the quantum espresso . the calculation conditions are summarized as follows . the energy cut - off for the wave function expansion was 30 , while the cut - off for the charge density was 240 . the brillouin zone integration was done using a mesh of 8 for the largest super cell adopted . these values were refined , if the computation facility allowed much accurate calculations . the convergence criterion for the force constant was that the simulation ended , when the absolute value of the total force vector became less than 1 . to explore possible high reactivity of cu nano - structures , we considered atomic - layer structures . an important structure for our discussion is the cu triangular lattice ( cu - tl ) . in this section , we show data for structural and electronic properties of cu - tl . we obtained an optimized lattice structure using a cu atomic layer in a primitive super cell . major calculation conditions were the same as those given in section . the -point mesh was 24 in this simulation . the cell was given in a hexagonal structure . the vacuum layer had thickness of 15 . in this simulation , the value of the lattice constant was optimized . the bond length was found to be 2.43 . ) this value is rather small compared to the bond length 2.55 of the bulk fcc cu . the reason for shrink in the bond length is mainly to reduce the total band energy . the total energy of tl was energetically higher than the bulk cu by 1.2 ev per a cu atom . of the triangular lattice of cu . the value of in rydberg is given as a function of the lattice constant . , height=302 ] starting from some initial conditions , we found appearance of cu - tl in optimized structures . as another evidence to show the local stability of cu - tl , we considered an atomic two - layer structure ( atls ) . this structure was obtained by cutting the bulk fcc cu crystal and was placed in a simulation super - cell . the layer structure was perpendicular to the ( 100 ) direction of bulk cu and thus was contained in an orthorhombic unit cell . energy difference between atls and cu - tl was 3.11 ev per a cu atom . an optimization calculation of the structure concluded local stability . but , atls was not kept against global reconstruction which was happened when an no molecule was adsorbed on it . furthermore , we found a strongly reacted structure starting from an no molecule adsorbed on atls . it means that using atls as an initial structure , naively speaking , we realized simulated annealing in our simulation . compared with this un - stable structure , cu - tl was found to be stable . once the molecule was adsorbed on atls , reconstruction of atls happened and formation of cu - tl was observed in our simulations . conversely , we can say that cu - tl is stable against distortion making corrugation toward atls . even when one observed local stability of an atomic structure in simulation , however , a final evidence of the structure would be requested to be given using real experiments . realization of an atomically thin layer , i.e. cu - tl , will need development of a fabrication method . recently , formation of an atomic layer of pb on the si(111 ) surface was reported . in this superconducting pb system , positions of pb atoms are affected by the atomic structure of the substrate and inter - atomic distance between pb atoms is not determined independently from the substrate . the most remarkable example of natural realization of the atomic layer is graphene . this unique flexible structure of carbon is possible to be supported in air according to the strong c - c sp bonding . peeling a graphene sheet and pasting it on a silicon - di - oxide surface , graphene is obtained efficiently from graphite . in case of cu , we may expect formation of an atomic layer on a suitable inert substrate . we might be able to keep the atomic layer as a film pasted on a support with a nano - meter - scale hole . then , mechanical properties of the atomic layer would be paid attention like a graphene sheet . but for our consideration of no adsorption , a local structure of cu is important . so , we assume an atomic - scale local structure in a part of nano - scale cu . the density of states ( dos ) of cu - tl is shown in fig . . the major peaks are characterized similarly to the bulk copper . looking dos from the low energy region , we see that the 4s band starts from -6.38 ev and spreads over above the fermi energy . sharp peaks of 3d levels are seen from -4.04 ev but the 3d bands end below the fermi level . thus , parfectly filled 3d band with the configuration is kept and the structure behaves as an metal . these characteristic features are seen in the electronic band structure of cu - tl , too . ) along the -m line , or the k- line , we see hybridization of the 4s band and a 3d band . comparison with the cu ( 111 ) surface allows us to evaluate similarity and difference between cu - tl and the bulk cu surface . the density of states in the 4s band leveled almost around 0.2 owing to two - dimensional nature . dos in the 3d bands peaked well above 10 for cu - tl in the unit of states / ev per a unit cell , while the value is from 4 to 6 , except for a singularity at the top of the 3d bands , for the cu ( 111 ) surface . the shorter bond length of cu atoms , the height in dos should be lower in a fixed lattice structure . thus , the higher dos peak for cu - tl than for the bulk cu suggests that two - dimensional nature of cu - tl affects dos . since dos at the fermi level is almost the same for both cu - tl and the cu ( 111 ) surface , the chemical reactivity of no is expected to be similar , if the structure is kept undeformed . however , we should note that the top of cu 3d bands is much closer to the fermi energy for cu - tl than the cu ( 111 ) surface . this tendency suggests higher reactivity of cu - tl against no . when the stable adsorption site is the on - top site , similarity in characteristic energy like the adsorption energy would be expected . however , if a bridge site or a hollow site became stable for no on cu - tl , we could have difference even in the chemical reactivity from that on the cu ( 111 ) surface . this is because much easy deformation of the cu network structure is expected for cu - tl and the bond formation between no and cu - tl will create distortion . in the next section , we discuss occurrence of strong reactions between no and cu - tl . we consider adsorption of no on cu - tl and an atomic step like structure ( ass ) created on an cu atomic layer . the second structure was found in optimization simulations of no adsorption on atls . observing results of no - adsorbed structures starting from atls , we identified a stable substrate structure in a super cell as cu - tl with ass in our simulations . therefore , we regarded cu - tl and ass as typical atomic - scale layer structures of cu . several characteristic adsorption sites for no were found on these structures . molecular adsorbed structures were obtained by structural optimization . starting from an initial structure with a no molecule a little separated from a substrate , cu - tl , ass or atls , each adsorbed structure was determined . by a series of simulations , we found the next general rules for molecular adsorption . on cu - tl , adsorption on a hollow site is energetically most favorable . on ass , a bridge site on the cu array is energetically most favorable among sites including an on - top site , a hollow site in the back surface , and a bridge site in the back surface . thus , we treat these locally stable structures only in the following discussion . while , structures corresponding to dissociative adsorption were given by locating n and o atoms a little separated on the substrate and by optimizing the whole structure . we have found two locally stable dissociative adsorbed structures on cu - tl and on ass . the structures are depicted in fig . . as typical structures , we consider these structures only . we define the adsorption energy by the next formula . here , is the molecular adsorption energy , while is the dissociative adsorption energy . the values of and are the total energy of a cu slab with no and that of another slab with a n atom and an o atom adsorbed on the cu slab , is the total energy of a cu slab without no , and is the total energy of the no molecule contained in a super cell with the same size as the other calculations . molecular dissociation energy is defined as , adsorbed structures found in our simulations are itemized in the next list . the adsorption energy is also shown in each parenthesis for convenience . molecular adsorption on cu - tl : : in adsorption of a no molecule on a surface of cu - tl , a hollow site ( -0.83 ev ) is selected . see the center figure of fig . ( a ) . molecular adsorption on ass : : in adsorption of a no molecule on an atomic step - like structure , a bridge site ( -1.32 ev ) is selected . see the center figure of fig . ( b ) . dissociative adsorption : : dissociative adsorption of no is found on tl ( -1.92 ev ) and on ass ( -1.69 ev ) . see the right figures of fig . ( a ) and ( b ) . now , dissociative adsorption structures are discussed . we have two typical dissociative adsorption structures on cu - tl and on ass . in the first structure , the nitrogen atom locates at a center of five surrounding cu atoms . ( see the right figures of fig . ( a ) . ) this structure may be regarded as a nitrogen interstitial impurity in a cu lattice . arrangement of cu is largely distorted from pure tl , so that the n atom is embedded in cu layer . the oxygen atom locates at a hollow site and it is embedded in cu layer . the local structure of these impurity sites are ncu and ocu . here , the ocu structure is planer . a reason for appearance of the high coordination numbers for n and o is that cu valence is not largely modified and that 3d configuration is almost kept . 4s electrons are in extended states so that the local n and o are efficiently screened by neighboring five and four copper atoms . on ss , we have another dissociative adsorbed structure for no . the nitrogen atom is again embedded in the cu structure . ( see the right figure of fig . ( b ) . ) in this structure , the oxygen atom is at a bridge site and keeps two - fold coordination , while the nitrogen atom has four - fold coordination . now we compare the obtained values of adsorption energy with those in the literature . the molecular adsorption energy is higher for ass than those on cu - tl . except for a case of a bond - center site on the back surface of ass , molecular adsorption favors the bridge site of the step - like structure . this general tendency is natural in comparison to the other examples known in the literature . the most notable feature of our results is the finding of the large dissociative adsorption energy . we conclude that the dissociative adsorption may happen , when the nitrogen atom can go to an interstitial site of a cu structure . the large value of ( -1.92 ev on tl and -1.69 ev on ass ) is actually possible , since these structures possess high coordination of cu around the nitrogen atom . on the clean cu ( 111 ) surface , no favors the molecular adsorption ( with the adsorption energy of -1.22 ev estimated in ref . ) against the dissociation of no , where the dissociative adsorption energy is estimated to be -0.79 ev in ref . . the qualitative difference between data for known bulk surfaces and our result should be attributed on movement of cu atoms in the reconstruction process . in our simulation , positions of cu atoms are rather easily modified because the atomic structure of cu is just a single layer . even in the optimization simulation , we can reach the nitrogen insertion in the cu structures . from the present result , we conjecture the following picture . if a cu structure allows large configurational distortion owing to the chemical reaction with no , the nitrogen atom can move into the cu structure and form the local ncu configuration . ( or 5 . ) owing to the energy reduction coming from the large formation energy of the local ncu structure , we can expect even the dissociative adsorption of no on cu . in the real cu nano - structures , there can happen large distortion of cu configuration owing to finite temperatures and possible local strain . therefore , our simulation , which is prepared using the atomic layer of cu , might have derived a hidden possible path of the no dissociative adsorption on cu structures . to estimate a reaction path on the no reduction on cu - tl , we estimated the local structure and the energy of a transition state using the nudged - elastic - band method . the initial configuration was the molecular adsorbed structure on cu - tl and the final configuration was the dissociative adsorbed structure obtained in . the dissociation reaction was determined by obtaining the transition state with an energy for the no reduction process . the activation energy for dissociation of no on the atomic layer is estimated using the next definition . an upper bound of the transition potential barrier is estimated to be 1.4 ev . in the initial state , the no molecule adsorbed on cu - tl with the nitrogen atom binding to the cu surface . in the transition state , the oxygen atom had local bond connections with surrounding cu atoms to reduce the total energy . to form this distorted structure in the transition state , the whole cu atomic configuration were optimized , creating drastic change in cu - tl . utilizing the dft - gga simulations , we have shown that no dissociative adsorption may happen on an atomic cu layer , which is the triangular lattice of cu atoms ( cu - tl ) . the reactivity of cu - tl against molecular adsorption of no was found to be similar to the cu(111 ) surface . some stable sites for no were found to give molecular adsorption . however , our optimization simulation revealed that there was a co - adsorbed structure of n and o atoms , which was energetically stabler by 1.08ev than the molecular adsorbed cu - tl structure . a reaction path estimation showed existence of a path with an energy barrier of 1.4ev . thus , we may conclude molecular dissociation of no on the cu atomic layer . the large dissociation energy appears owing to formation of local n - cu or o - cu bondings and creation of local n - cu and o - cu structures . we further considered an atomic step - like structure ( ass ) of cu , which was an atomic - scale wrinkle in the cu - tl structure . the absolute value of the molecular adsorption energy on the step was larger than the values found for cu - bulk surfaces or cu - tl . our simulation revealed that there existed a dissociative adsorbed structure in which a nitrogen impurity site embedded in a cu structure was created . the estimated dissociation energy of no became -0.37 ev on ass . flexibility against modification of this cu atomic structure in the nano - meter scale is decisive both to stabilize dissociative adsorption of no and to reduce the energy barrier on the no - reduction path . catalytic activity of cu to reduce no should appear on the atomically flexible cu networks . therefore , in order to realize cu - based no reduction catalysts , it is important to create atomic structures of cu , i.e. atomic layers , atomic scale clusters , and atomic scale networks , which allow conformational change . this work was supported by the elements science and technology project and also by grant - in - aid for scientific research in priority area ( no . 19051016 ) and a grants - in - aid for scientific research ( no . 22360049 ) . the computation is partly done using the computer facility of issp , univ . of tokyo , and ri2 t , kyushu university . 10 satterfied c n 1996 heterogeneous catalysis in industrial practice , 2nd ed .

{"article": "there are reasons to believe that cosmic rays ( crs ) around the ankle at gev are dominated by extragalactic protons . scattering processes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) limit the propagation of ultra high energy ( uhe ) charged particles in our universe . a continuation of a power - like cr spectrum above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff at about gev is only consistent with the proton dominance if the sources lie within the proton attenuation length of about 50 mpc . very few astrophysical accelerators can generate crs with energies above the gzk cutoff ( see e.g. for a review ) and so far none of the candidate sources have been confirmed in our local environment . it has been speculated that decaying superheavy particles , possibly some new form of dark matter or remnants of topological defects , could be a source of uhe crs , but also these proposals are not fully consistent with the cr spectrum at lower energies . the observation of gzk excesses has led to speculations about a different origin of uhe crs . berezinsky and zatsepin proposed that cosmogenic neutrinos produced in the decay of the gzk photopions could explain these events assuming a strong neutrino nucleon interaction . we have followed this idea in ref . and investigated the statistical goodness of scenarios with strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin sources using cr data from agasa and hires ( see fig . ) and limits from horizontal events at agasa and contained events at rice . -branes , and string excitations ( see ref . ) . ] the flux of uhe extragalactic protons from distant sources is redshifted and also subject to pair production and photopion - production in the cmb which can be taken into account by means of propagation functions . the resonantly produced photopions provide a guaranteed source of cosmogenic uhe neutrinos observed at earth . in astrophysical accelerators inelastic scattering of the beam protons off the ambient photon gas in the source will also produce photopions which provide an additional source of uhe neutrinos . the corresponding spectrum will in general depend on the details of the source such as the densities of the target photons and the ambient gas . we have used the flux of crs from optically thin sources using the luminosities given in ref . in the goodness - of - fit test . for a reasonable and consistent contribution of extragalactic neutrinos in vertical crs one has to assume a strong and rapid enhancement of the neutrino nucleon interaction . the realization of such a behavior has been proposed in scenarios beyond the ( perturbative ) sm ( see ref . ) . for convenience , we have approximated the strong neutrino nucleon cross section in our analysis by a -behavior shown in fig . , parameterized by the energy scale and width of the transition , and the amplification compared to the standard model predictions . our analysis showed that uhe crs measured at agasa and hires can be interpreted to the 90% cl as a composition of extragalactic protons and strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin sources in agreement with experimental results from horizontal events at agasa and contained events at rice ( see fig . ) . the pierre auger observatory combines the experimental techniques of agasa and hires as a hybrid detector . with a better energy resolution , much higher statistics and also stronger bounds on horizontal showers it will certainly help to clarify our picture of uhe crs in the future . the author would like to thank the organizers of the erice school on nuclear physics 2005 `` neutrinos in cosmology , in astro , particle and nuclear physic '' for the inspiring workshop and vihkos ( `` virtuelles institut fr hochenergiestrahlungen aus dem kosmos '' ) for support . m. ahlers , a. ringwald , and h. tu , astropart .

{"article": "a multistable system is one that possesses a large number of coexisting attractors for a fixed set of parameters . there is ample evidence for such phenomena in the natural sciences , with examples coming from neurosciences and neural dynamics - , optics , chemistry , condensed matter and geophysics . multistability also seems to be an essential complexity - generating mechanism in a large class of agent - based models . in view of this , it is important to identify the dynamical mechanisms leading to multistability and , in particular , to construct simple models where this phenomenon might be under control . the first mathematical result in this direction was obtained by newhouse who proved that , near a homoclinic tangency , a class of diffeomorphisms in a two - dimensional manifold has infinitely many attracting periodic orbits ( sinks ) , a result that was later extended to higher dimensions . it has also been proved that , in addition to infinitely many sinks , infinitely many strange attractors exist near the homoclinic tangencies . the stability of the phenomena under small random perturbations has been studied . a second dynamical mechanism leading to multistability is the addition of small dissipative perturbations to conservative systems . conservative systems have a large number of coexisting invariant sets , namely periodic orbits , invariant tori and cantori . by adding a small amount of dissipation to a conservative system one finds that some of the invariant sets become attractors . not all invariant sets of the conservative system will survive when the dissipation is added . however , for sufficiently small dissipation , many attractors ( mainly periodic orbits ) have been observed in typical systems . the problem of migration between attractors and their stability in multiple - attractor systems has also been studied by other authors . most of results are based on numerical evidence . however , using the techniques of deformation stability some rigorous mathematical results may be obtained . finally , it has been found recently that , for parameter values near the feigenbaum period - doubling accumulation point , quadratic maps coupled by convex coupling may have a large number of stable periodic orbits . this is one of the phenomena we study in detail in this paper . the emphasis on quadratic maps near the feigenbaum accumulation point has a motivation close to the idea of control of chaos . the typical situation in control of chaos , is that of a strange attractor with an infinite number of embedded periodic orbits , all of them unstable . these orbits are then stabilized by several methods . if , instead of a large number of unstable periodic orbits , one has , for example , a large number of sinks , the controlling situation would seem more promising and robust , because the control need not be so accurate . it would suffice to keep the system inside the desired basin of attraction . at the period - doubling accumulation point the feigenbaum attractor , because of the properties of the flip bifurcations , coexists with an infinite set of unstable periodic orbits . by coupling , as we will show , an arbitrarily large number of orbits may become stable . the existence of a large number of stable periodic orbits for just two coupled quadratic maps , provides a simple model where multistability is well under control , in the sense that not only the nature of the phenomenon is completely understood as one may also compute the range of parameters that provides any desired number of stable orbits . this should be contrasted , for example , with concrete models for the newhouse phenomenon . rather than merely focusing on multistability , we also study the phenomenology of two coupled quadratic maps , in particular the bifurcations of periodic orbits and the regime of synchronization .. the stabilization of orbits in the coupled system is similar to that obtained in higher dimensional coupled map lattices with the exception that , due to the restricted dimension of the phase space , the types of bifurcations are different in our system . the results concerning the multistability phenomenon at also considerably extend , and also correct , some imprecise statements in . coupled map lattices ( cml ) are discrete dynamical systems generated by the composition of a local nonlinearity and a coupling . the phase space of the cml considered in this letter is the square ^{2} ] into itself . therefore , the convex combination in  ensures that ^{2})\\subset ^{2} ] , and one can prove that synchronization occurs . when is sufficiently small , this happens even though . starting from synchronization and modifying the parameters , non - synchronized ( periodic ) orbits appear from bifurcations of synchronized ( periodic ) ones . to understand this phenomenon , as well as the bifurcations of subsequent orbits , we now study analytically the periodic orbits of period 1 and 2 . let be the synchronized fixed point denoted in -variables . it exists for any values of the parameters and has no other fixed point in ^{2} ] . computing the corresponding jacobian , one obtains the equation for the multipliers \\lambda + \\left ( 1 - 2\\varepsilon \\right ) ^{2}(s^{2}-d^{2})^{2}=0\\ ] ] where direct calculations show that , if , the multipliers , say and , have zero imaginary part iff . under this condition , we have if and iff . ( the inequality indeed holds if and , see figure 1 . ) consequently , by increasing , the symmetric orbit suffers an inverse pitchfork bifurcation at . this bifurcation is generic for a symmetric orbit in a system with symmetry and the conditions of the bifurcation theorem hold when the curve is crossed upward . this bifurcation creates two non - symmetric period-2 orbits ( one orbit and its symmetric ) . we have checked that these orbits exist for any and . for , their components are combinations of a fixed point of and the components of a period-2 orbit . when the imaginary part of and is not zero , we have . ( once again , if and , the inequality is satisfied , see figure 1 . ) the symmetric orbit is thus stable in the interval . if and the curve is crossed upward , this orbit suffers a hopf bifurcation creating a locally stable invariant circle . a numerical calculation shows that the latter is destroyed when is sufficiently large or when is sufficiently small . obviously , if , it does not exist and the bifurcation at which is a period - doubling bifurcation of creates a period-4 orbit . note that invariant circles in two - dimensional cml resulting from the destabilization of a symmetric orbit and their normal form had already been reported in . in that work , the system is also defined by  , but the local map is and may be larger than . figure 2 shows an example of the phenomenology described above . numerically , it is more convenient to follow the orbits from to increasing values of the coupling . in this picture , as well as in the following ones the map parameter is ( the accumulation point of the period - doubling cascade ) . in figure 2 , from ( the circle ) to ( the point labelled 1 ) , the symmetric orbit is unstable . the figure also shows the invariant circle for . between the points 1 and 2 , the symmetric orbit is stable . at point 2 , the pitchfork occurs , the symmetric orbit becomes unstable and the non - symmetric orbits are created . finally , the point 3  corresponds to the collapse on the synchronized fixed point . the previous phenomenology is not restricted to small periods but extend to any power of 2 . in particular , the synchronized period- orbit may destabilize to create a symmetric ( non - synchronized ) orbit of twice the period . given , let be the components of the period- orbit of . the points are the components of the synchronized period- orbit of . by the chain rule and since each jacobian at is diagonal , the corresponding multiplier along the anti - diagonal direction is the condition that this multiplier equals determines , if , a co - dimension 1 period - doubling bifurcation . applying the reasoning of the previous section to each component , we conclude that this bifurcation creates an orbit with the property and for all , which is called a phase - opposition period- orbit . since , this bifurcation occurs only if the bifurcation along the diagonal direction has occurred ( the local period - doubling bifurcation of ) . in other words , the phase opposition period- orbit exists only if the synchronized period- orbit does . moreover it follows from figure 3 that , at least for , the phase opposition period- orbit exists only if the phase opposition period- orbit does . this is confirmed analytically for the period orbit whose existence condition is the instability of the synchronized period orbit in the anti - diagonal direction . one obtains and if and and if ( see figure 1 ) . furthermore , a numerical calculation at , reported in figure 3 , shows that the succession of bifurcations of a phase opposition orbit does not depend on the period . on this picture , we have plotted the values of for the hopf bifurcation , the pitchfork bifurcation and the period - doubling bifurcation creating the orbit , versus the power of the period . for each period , the phenomenology is identical to that described in the previous section , with an adequate change of scale in . in addition , the picture shows that several phase opposition orbits may be stable for fixed . this stabilization is an effect of the coupling that will be discussed below . finally , since the phase opposition orbits are the first orbits to appear when the parameters are varied from synchronization and since the first such orbit that is created is of period 2 , it follows that a necessary and sufficient condition for synchronization is , the condition for the existence of the latter . we now analyze the existence and the stability of other period- orbits for . our interest for this value of is that the scaling properties of are reflected on scaling laws for the periods and values of at which the bifurcations occur ( see figure 3 and 8) . we only consider the orbits which for have the same period on projection to both axis and . these orbits are followed numerically when increases and are referred using the phase shift of their components at . for , the map has a period- orbit for each , whose components for up to 5 are shown in figure 5 . in this picture , the numbers reflect the order in which the components are visited and the tree structure represents the origin of each component in the bifurcation cascade . an important notion is the dyadic distance between the components of an orbit . is the number of steps one has to go back in the bifurcation tree to meet a common component . the dyadic distance is used to characterize the families of periodic orbits that we are considering . for instance , the coordinates of each component of a synchronized orbit are at distance 0 , those of a phase - opposition orbit are at distance 1 . accordingly , when we speak of distance orbit we refer to the dyadic distance of the coordinates of its components . for any , there are different orbits with distance which have coordinates out of phase by steps , with . the distance of a period- orbit is at most  . for , the only symmetric orbits are those at distance 0 and 1 . this property is preserved for as shows figure 6 for . the succession of bifurcations of orbits with distance should then differ from those with distance 1 . the differences are seen in figure 6 which shows the evolution of the eigenvalues . for , the orbit is unstable . when increases , it suffers two collisions with orbits of twice the period when the eigenvalues cross and then becomes stable . ( when decreasing , these collisions would be period - doubling bifurcations . ) if increases further , the orbit collides with an unstable one of the same period in a saddle - node bifurcation when the larger eigenvalue reaches 1 . for larger values of , the orbit does not exist . the unstable orbit with which it collides is the one that at has period in one projection and in the other . for higher dyadic distances , the overall variation of the eigenvalues is similar to the case . figure 7 shows a typical example of these phenomena for the case . between and the point labelled 1 in the figure , the orbit is unstable . the point 1 corresponds to the smaller eigenvalue crossing -1 ( see figure 6 ) . therefore , between the point 1 and 2 , the orbit is stable . it disappear at the point 2 when it collides with an unstable orbit of the same period . we have seen that the coupling stabilizes the orbits with distance larger than 0 at . there are indeed two mechanisms responsible for this stabilization .. the determinant of the jacobian of a period- orbit is the term coming from the coupling decreases when increases . however , there is yet a second stabilizing mechanism . denote by the remaining factor in the determinant without coupling , is simply the square of the multiplier of for the periodic orbit . from the properties of the feigenbaum - cvitanovic functional equation it follows that this factor converges to a fixed value around when increases . the coupling however , changes the position of the orbit components in such a way that this factor also decreases . it is the combined action of this decrease with the contraction of the coupling that brings the eigenvalues into the interior of the unit circle and stabilizes the orbits . for small there is a simple geometrical interpretation for the variation of . the reason why in the one dimensional map the product remains constant , when grows , is because each time the period doubles , the doubling in the number of factors greater than one is compensated by the fact that the component of the orbit closest to zero approaches zero a little more . for the unstable orbits along the period - doubling chain , the orbit components closest to zero alternate on each side of the origin . the contracting effect of the convex coupling tends to bring the orbits back in the period - doubling hierarchy . therefore , because the component closest to zero has to move across the origin for the orbit to approach the one with half the period , this implies that the product of the coordinates is going to decrease . the greater the dyadic distance between the orbit projections on the axis , the greater will be the perturbation that the original ( one - dimensional ) orbits suffer . therefore one expects the contracting effect in to increase with the dyadic distance . this effect is quite apparent on figure 8 which shows the stabilizing and destabilizing lines for orbits with distance from 1 to 4 . the shift downwards of the stable regions for successively larger dyadic distances implies that the smaller is , the larger the number of distinct stable orbits that are obtained . an accurate numerical estimate of the number of distinct orbits is obtained by computing the derivative at for each and dyadic distance . actually this derivative provides an accurate estimate of itself , because this one varies almost linearly with for most of the stable range of the orbits . on figure 9 , the scaling properties , when grows , of this derivative are shown . from these results one computes with notice that in figure 9 there is more than one data point for each pair which correspond to non -

{"article": "among the great variety of the works devoted to random motions at finite speed in the euclidean spaces ( see , , , for the markovian case and , for different non - markovian cases ) , the markov random flight in the three - dimensional euclidean space is , undoubtedly , the most difficult and hard to study . while in the low even - dimensional spaces and one managed to obtain the distributions of the motions in an explicit form ( see , and , respectively ) , in the important three - dimensional case only a few results are known . the absolutely continuous part of the transition density of the symmetric markov random flight with unit speed in the euclidean space was presented in ( * ? ? ? * formulas ( 1.3 ) and ( 4.21 ) therein ) . it has an extremely complicated form of an integral with variable limits whose integrand involves inverse hyperbolic tangent function . this formula has so complicated form that can not even be evaluated by means of standard computer environments . moreover , the lack of the speed parameter in this formula impoverishes somewhat the model because it does not allow to study the limiting behaviour of the motion under various scaling conditions ( under kac s condition , for example ) . the presence of both parameters ( i.e. the speed and the intensity of switchings ) in any process of markov random flight makes it , undoubtedly , the most adequate and realistic model for describing the finite - velocity diffusion in the euclidean spaces . these parameters can not be considered as independent because they are connected with each other through the time ( namely , the speed is the distance passed per unit of time and the intensity is the mean number of switchings per unit of time ) . another question concerning the density presented in is the infinite discontinuity at the origin . while the infinite discontinuity of the transition density on the border of the diffusion area is a quite natural property in some euclidean spaces of low dimensions ( see for the euclidean plane and ( * ? ? ? * the second term of formulas ( 1.3 ) and ( 4.21 ) ) , , ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 3.12 ) ) in the space ) , the discontinuity at the origin looks somewhat strange and hard to explain . the difficulty of analysing the three - dimensional markov random flight and , on the other hand , the great theoretical and applied importance of the problem of describing the finite - velocity diffusion in the space suggest to look for other methods of studying this model . that is why various asymptotic theorems yielding a good approximation would be a fairly desirable aim of the research . such asymptotic results could be obtained by using the characteristic functions technique . in the case of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight some important results for its characteristic functions were obtained . in particular , the closed - form expression for the laplace transform of the characteristic function was obtained by different methods in ( * ? ? ? * formulas ( 1.6 ) and ( 5.8 ) ) ( for unit speed ) and in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 45 ) ) , ( for arbitrary speed ) . a general relation for the conditional characteristic functions of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight conditioned by the number of changes of direction , was given in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 3.8 ) ) . the key point in these formulas is the possibility of evaluating the inverse laplace transforms of the powers of the inverse tangent functions in the complex right half - plane . this is the basic idea of deriving the series representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three changes of direction given in section 3 . based on these representations , an asymptotic formula , as time , for the unconditional characteristic function is obtained in section 4 and the error in this formula has the order . the inverse fourier transformation of the unconditional characteristic function yields an asymptotic formula for the transition density of the process which is presented in section 5 . this formula shows that the density is discontinuous on the border , but it is continuous at the origin , as it must be . the unexpected and interesting peculiarity is that the conditional density corresponding to two changes of direction contains a term having an infinite discontinuity on the border of the diffusion area . from this fact it follows that such conditional density is discontinuous itself on the border and this differs the 3d - model from its 2d - counterpart where only the conditional density of the single change of direction has an infinite discontinuity on the border . the error in the obtained asymptotic formula has the order . in section 6 we estimate the accuracy of the asymptotic formula and show that it gives a good approximation on small time intervals whose lengths depend on the intensity of switchings . finally , in appendices we prove a series of auxiliary lemmas that have been used in our analysis . consider the stochastic motion of a particle that , at the initial time instant , starts from the origin of the euclidean space and moves with some constant speed ( note that is treated as the constant norm of the velocity ) . the initial direction is a random three - dimensional vector with uniform distribution on the unit sphere the motion is controlled by a homogeneous poisson process of rate as follows . at each poissonian instant , the particle instantaneously takes on a new random direction distributed uniformly on independently of its previous motion and keeps moving with the same speed until the next poisson event occurs , then it takes on a new random direction again and so on . let be the particle s position at time which is referred to as the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight . at arbitrary time instant the particle , with probability 1 , is located in the closed three - dimensional ball of radius centred at the origin : consider the probability distribution function of the process , where is the infinitesimal element in the space . for arbitrary fixed , the distribution consists of two components . the singular component corresponds to the case when no poisson events occur on the time interval and it is concentrated on the sphere in this case , at time instant , the particle is located on the sphere and the probability of this event is if at least one poisson event occurs on the time interval , then the particle is located strictly inside the ball and the probability of this event is the part of the distribution corresponding to this case is concentrated in the interior of the ball and forms its absolutely continuous component . let be the density of distribution . it has the form where is the density ( in the sense of generalized functions ) of the singular component of concentrated on the sphere and is the density of the absolutely continuous component of concentrated in . the singular part of density  is given by the formula : where is the dirac delta - function . the absolutely continuous part of density  has the form : where is some positive function absolutely continuous in and is the heaviside unit - step function given by asymptotic behaviour of the transition density  on small time intervals is the main subject of this research . since its singular part is explicitly given by  , then our efforts are mostly concentrated on deriving the respective asymptotic formulas for the absolutely continuous component  of the density . our main tool is the characteristic functions technique because , as it was mentioned above , some closed - form expressions for the characteristic functions ( both conditional and unconditional ones ) of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight are known . in this section we obtain the series representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three changes of direction . these formulas are the basis for our further analysis leading to asymptotic relations for the unconditional characteristic function and the transition density of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight on small time intervals . the main result of this section is given by the following theorem . * theorem 1 . * the conditional characteristic functions and corresponding to two and three changes of direction are given , respectively , by the formulas : where is bessel function , is the generalized hypergeometric function given by  ( see below ) and the coefficients are given by the formula 0.2 cm proof . it was proved in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 3.8 ) ) that , for arbitrary , the characteristic function ( that is , fourier transform with respect to spatial variable ) of the conditional density of the three -

plane . moreover , each of these functions contains the inversion complex variable in a negative power and behaves like , as , and , therefore , all these complex functions rapidly tend to zero at infinity . according to ( * table 8.4 -

form expressions for the respective conditional densities . these formulas can , nevertheless , be used for obtaining the important asymptotic relations and this is the main subject of the next sections . using the results of the previous section , we can now present an asymptotic relation on small time intervals for the characteristic function of the three -

dimensional markov random flight is the difference between the approximating function and the exact function given by  and  enables us to estimate the value of the probability generated by all the terms of the density aggregated in the term of asymptotic relation  . the shapes of functions and on the time interval for the values of the intensity of switchings are presented in figures 2 and 3 . + + + + we see that , for , the function yields a very good coincidence with function on the subinterval ( fig . 2 ( left ) ) , while for ( fig . 2 ( right ) ) such coincidence is good only on the subinterval . the same phenomenon is also clearly seen in figure 3 where , for , the function yields a very good coincidence with function on the subinterval ( fig . 3 ( left ) ) , while for such good coincidence takes place only on the subinterval ( fig . 3 ( right ) ) . thus , we can conclude that the greater is the intensity of switchings , the shorter is the subinterval of coincidence . this fact can easily be explained . really , the greater is the intensity of switchings , the shorter is the time interval , on which no more than three changes of directions can occur with big probability . this means that , for increasing , the asymptotic formula  yields a good accuracy on more and more small time intervals . however , for arbitrary fixed , there exists some such that formula  yields a good accuracy on the time interval and the error of this approximation does not exceed . this is the essence of the asymptotic formula  . * appendices * in the following appendices we establish some lemmas that have been used in the proofs of the above theorems . note that some of them are of a separate mathematical interest because no similar results can be found in the mathematical handbooks . * lemma a1 . * for arbitrary integer and for arbitrary real , the following formula holds : 0.2 cm proof . using the well -

similarity process , e.g. , fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , the measured is linear with . while for the multifractal process , e.g. , turbulent velocity , it is usually convex with . other methods are available to extract the scaling exponent . for example , wavelet based methodologies , ( e.g. , wavelet leaders , wavelet transform modulus maxima ) , hilbert - based method , or the scaling analysis of probability density function of velocity increments , to name a few . each method has its owner advantages and shortcomings . for example , the classical sfs is found to mix information of the large- ( resp . known as infrared effect ) and small - scale ( resp . known as ultraviolet effect ) structures . the corresponding scaling exponent is thus biased when a large energetic structure is present . previously the influence of the large - scale structure has been considered extensively by several authors . for example , praskvosky et al . , found strong correlations between the large scales and the velocity sfs at all length scales . sreenivasan & stolovitzky observed that the inertial range of the sfs conditioned on the large scale velocity show a strong dependence . huang et al . , showed analytically that the influence of the large - scale structure could be as large as two decades down to the small scales . blum et al . , studied experimentally the nonuniversal large - scale structure by considering both conditional eulerian and lagrangian sfs . they found that both sfs depend on the strength of large - scale structures at all scales . in their study , the large - scale structure velocity is defined as two - point average , i.e. , /2 ] , a linear trend is removed within a window size . ideally , scales larger than , i.e. , are removed or constrained from the original data . this implies that the da procedure is a high - pass filter in the physical domain . the kinetic energy of is related directly with its fourier power spectrum , i.e. , in which and is the fourier power spectrum of . this illustrates again that the da procedure acts a high - pass filter , in which the lower fourier modes ( resp . ) are expected to be removed or constrained . for a scaling process , i.e. , , it leads a power - law behavior , i.e. , the physical meaning of is quite clear . it represents a cumulative energy over the fourier wavenumber band ] ) . we emphasize here again that the da acts as a high - pass filter in physical domain and the intermittency nature of is still retained . the above mentioned detrending analysis can remove / constrain the large - scale influence , known as infrared effect . this could be utilized to redefine the sf to remove / constrain the large - scale structure effect as following . after the da procedure , , the velocity increment can be defined within a window size as , i.e. , in which represents for the th segment . we will show in the next subsection why we define an increment with a half width of the window size . a th - order dsf is then defined as , i.e. , for a scaling process , we expect a power - law behavior , i.e. , in which the scaling exponent is comparable with the one provided by the original sfs . to access negative orders of ( resp . the right part of the singularity spectrum , see definition below ) , the dsfs can be redefined as , i.e. , in which is local average for the th segment . a power - law behavior is expected , i.e. , . it is found experimentally that when , eqs .  and  provide the same scaling exponents . in the following we do not discriminate these two definitions for dsfs . for different methods : structure - function ( dashed line ) , first - order detrending analysis ( thin solid line ) , and the detrended structure - function ( thick solid line ) . the detrended scale is demonstrated by a vertical solid line with . ideally , scales larger than , i.e. , ( resp . ) are expected to be removed after the detrending process . ] to understand better the filter property of the detrending procedure and dsfs , we introduce here a weight function , i.e. , in which is the fourier power spectrum of , and is a second - order moment , which could be one of or , or , respectively . the weight function characterizes the contribution of the fourier component to the corresponding second - order moment . note that an integral constant is neglected in the eq .  . for the second - order sfs , one has the following weight function , i.e. , for a scaling process , one usually has a fast decaying fourier spectrum , i.e. with . hence , the contribution from small - scale ( resp . high wavenumber fourier mode ) is decreasing . the sfs might be more influenced by the large - scale part for large values of . for the detrended data , the corresponding weight function is ideally to be as the following , i.e. , the dsfs ( resp . the combination of the da and sf ) have a weight function , i.e. , comparing with the original sfs , the dsfs defined here can remove / constrain the large - scale effect . figure shows the corresponding for the sf , detrending analysis , and dsf , respectively . the detrended scale is illustrated by a vertical line , i.e. , . we note here that with the definition of eq .  , provides a better compatible interpretation with the fourier power spectrum since we have . this is the main reason why we define the velocity increment with the half size of the window width . we provide some comments on eq .  . the above argument is exactly valid for linear and stationary processes . in reality , the data are always nonlinear and nonstationary for some reasons , see more discussion in ref . . therefore , eq .  holds approximately for real data . another comment has to be emphasized here for the detrending procedure . several approaches might be applied to remove the trend . however , the trend might be linear or nonlinear . therefore , different detrending approaches might provide different performances . in the present study , we only consider the st - order polynomial detrending procedure , which is efficient for many types of data . for fractional brownian motion with on the range . the inset shows the singularity spectrum on the range . the errorbar is the standard deviation estimated from 100 realizations . ideally , one should have and . both methods provide the same and and statistical error . ] for the lognormal process with an intermittent parameter . the errorbar is the standard deviation from the 100 realizations . the theoretical singularity curve is illustrated by a solid line . both estimators provide the same singularity spectra and statistical error . ] we first consider here the fractional brownian motion as a typical mono - scaling process . fbm is a gaussian self - similar process with a normal distribution increment , which is characterized by , namely hurst number . a wood - chan algorithm is used to synthesize the fbm with a hurst number . we perform 100 realizations with a data length points each . power - law behavior is observed on a large - range of scales for . the corresponding singularity spectrum is , i.e. , ideally , one should have a single point of singularity spectrum with and . however , in practice , the measured singularity spectrum is always lying in a narrow band . figure shows the measured singularity spectrum for sfs  and dsfs  for , in which the inset shows the singularity spectra estimated on the range . visually , both estimators provide the same and the same statistical error , which is defined as the standard deviation from different realizations . we now consider a multifractal random walk with a lognormal statistics . a multiplicative discrete cascade process with a lognormal statistics is performed to simulate a multifractal measure . the larger scale corresponds to a unique cell of size , where is the largest scale considered and is a dimensional scale ratio . in practice for a discrete model , this ratio is often taken as . the next scale involved corresponds to cells , each of size . this is iterated and at step  cells are retrieved . finally , at each point the multifractal measure is as the product of cascade random variables , i.e. , where is the random variable corresponding to position and level in the cascade . following the multifractal random walk idea , a nonstationary multifractal time series can be synthesized as , i.e. , where is brownian motion . taking a lognormal statistic for , the scaling exponent for the sfs , i.e. , , is written as , where is the intermittency parameter  characterizing the lognormal multifractal cascade . synthetic multifractal time series are generated following eq .  . an intermittent parameter is chosen for levels each , corresponding to a data length points each . a total of 100 realizations are performed . the statistical error is then measured as the standard deviation from these realizations . figure shows the corresponding measured singularity spectra , in which the theoretical value is illustrated by a solid line . graphically , the theoretical singularity spectra are recovered by both estimators . statistical error are again found to be the same for both estimators . we would like to provide some comments on the performance of these two estimators . for the synthesized processes , they have the same performance since there is no intrinsic structure in these synthesized data . but for the real data , as we mentioned above , they possess nonstationary and nonlinear structures . therefore , as shown in below , they might have different performance . and from experimental homogeneous and nearly isotropic turbulent flow . they are respectively 3rd - order sfs with  and without  absolute value , and 3rd - order dsfs with  and without  absolute value . the horizontal solid line indicates the kolmogorovs four - fifth law . an observed plateau for indicates an inertial range on the range , corresponding to a wavenumber range . roughly speaking , a plateau for indicates an inertial range on the range . the height of the inertial range are respectively  ,  ,  and  , in which the statistical error is the standard deviation obtained from the inertial range . note that the inertial range are for the sfs and for the dsfs . the corresponding scaling exponents are , , and . the statistical error is the 95% fitting confidence on the inertial range . ] . the errorbar is the standard deviation from 120 realizations . the inset shows the corresponding scaling exponents . for comparison , the lognormal model with an intermittent parameter is illustrated by a solid line . ] we consider here a velocity database obtained from a high reynolds number wind tunnel experiment in the johns - hopkins university with reynolds number . an probe array with four x - type hot wire anemometry is used to record the velocity with a sampling wavenumber of khz at streamwise direction , in which is the size of the active grid . these probes are placed in the middle height and along the center line of the wind tunnel to record the turbulent velocity simultaneously for a duration of 30 second . the measurement is then repeated for 30 times . finally , we have data points ( number of measurements number of probes duration time sampling wavenumber ) . therefore , there are 120 realizations ( number of measurements number of probes ) . the fourier power spectrum of the longitudinal velocity reveals a nearly two decades inertial range on the wavenumber range with a scaling exponent , see ref . this corresponds to time scales . here is the kolmogorov scale . note that we convert our results into spatial space by applying the taylors frozen hypothesis . more detail about this database can be found in ref. . to determine the inertial range in real space , we plot the measured compensated 3rd - order moments in fig. for the sfs ( with  and without  absolute value ) , dsfs ( with  and without  absolute value ) , respectively . a horizontal solid line indicates the kolmogorovs four - fifth law . a plateau is observed for on the range , which agrees very well with the inertial range predicted by , i.e. , on the range . the corresponding height and scaling exponent are with absolute value ( resp . without absolute value ) and ( resp . ) , respectively . the statistical error is the standard deviation obtained from the range . note that the kolmogorovs four - fifth law indicates a linear relation . it is interesting to note that , despite of the sign , we have on nearly two - decade scales . for comparison , the 3rd - order sfs are also shown . roughly speaking , a plateau is observed on the range . this inertial range is shorter than the one predicted by the fourier analysis or dsfs , which is now understood as the large - scale influence . the corresponding height and scaling exponent are without absolute value ( resp . with absolute value ) and ( resp . ) . therefore , the dsfs provide a better indicator of the inertial range since it removes / constrains the large - scale influence . we therefore estimate the scaling exponents for the on the range for directly without resorting to the extended self - similarity technique . for the sfs , we calculate the scaling exponents on the range for directly . figure shows the measured singularity spectra for , in which the errorbar is a standard deviation from 120 realizations . the inset shows the corresponding scaling exponents . for comparison , the lognormal model with an intermittent parameter is shown as a solid line . visually , the dsfs curve fully recovers the lognormal curve not only on the left part ( resp . ) but also on the right part ( resp . ) . due to the large - scale contamination , the sfs underestimates the scaling exponents when . this leads an overestimation of the left part of singularity spectrum ( see in fig. ) . however , if one resorts the ess algorithm when measuring the sf scaling exponent , the corresponding singularity spectrum is then horizontal shifted to the theoretical curve . this has been interpreted as that the ess technique suppresses the finite reynolds number effect . we show here that if one removes / constrains the effect of large - scale motions , one can retrieve the scaling exponent ( resp . singularity spectrum ) without resorting the ess technique . or in other words , the finite reynolds number effect manifests at large - scale motions , which is usually anisotropic too . in this paper , we introduce a detrended structure - function analysis to remove / constrain the influence of large - scale motions , known as the infrared effect . in the first step of our proposal , the st - order polynomial trend is removed within a window size . by doing so , the scales larger than , i.e. , , are expected to be removed / constrained . in the second step , a velocity increment is defined with a half of the window size . the dsf proposal is validated by the synthesized fractional brownian motion for the mono - fractal process and a lognormal random walk for the multifractal process . the numerical test shows that both sfs and dsfs estimators provide a comparable performance for synthesized processes without intrinsic structures . when applying to the turbulent velocity obtained from a high reynolds number wind tunnel experiment , the 3rd - order dsfs show a clearly inertial range on the range with a linear relation . the inertial range provided by dsfs is consistent with the one predicted by the fourier power spectrum . note that , despite of the sign , the kolmogorovs four - fifth law is retrieved for the 3rd - order dsfs . the corresponding 3rd - order sfs are biased by the large - scale structures , known as the infrared effect . it shows a shorter inertial range and underestimate the 3rd - order scaling exponent . the scaling exponents are then estimated directly without resorting to the ess technique . the corresponding singularity spectrum provided by the dsfs fully recovers the lognormal model with an intermittent parameter on the range . however , the classical sfs overestimate the left part singularity spectrum ( resp . underestimate the corresponding scaling exponents ) on the range . this has been interpreted as finite reynolds number effect and can be corrected by using the ess technique . here , to our knowledge , we show for the first time that if one removes / constrains the influence of the large - scale structures , one can recover the lognormal model without resorting to the ess technique . the method we proposed here is general and applicable to other complex dynamical systems , in which the multiscale statistics are relevant . it should be also applied systematically to more turbulent velocity databases with different reynolds numbers to see whether the finite reynolds number effect manifests on large - scale motions as well as we show for high reynolds number turbulent flows . this work is sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china under grant ( nos . 11072139 , 11032007,11161160554 , 11272196 , 11202122 and 11332006 ) , pu jiang project of shanghai ( no . 12pj1403500 ) , innovative program of shanghai municipal education commission ( no . 11zz87 ) and the shanghai program for innovative research team in universities . y.h . thanks prof . schmitt for useful comments and suggestions . we thank prof . meneveau for sharing his experimental velocity database , which is available for download at c. meneveau s web page : http://www.me.jhu.edu/meneveau/datasets.html . we thank the two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions . f. schmitt , y. huang , z. lu , y. liu , and n. fernandez , analysis of velocity fluctuations and their intermittency properties in the surf zone using empirical mode decomposition , j. mar . 77 ( 2009 ) , pp . 473481 . j. muzy , e. bacry , and a. arneodo , multifractal formalism for fractal signals : the structure -

{"article": "a fair number of astronomers and astronomy students have a physical challenge . it is our responsibility to learn the basics of accessibility to be able to help our library patrons to gain access to things that they need for their studies and work . astronomy is often seen as a very visual science . after all , its origins lie in looking at the skies . hence , it is a common belief that you need to use your sight to be able to study astronomy . this is strictly not true . in reality , we have been using assistive technologies telescopes , sensors , computers for a long time now to gain access to data that the human eye does not see unaided . visual information is coming to us as large streams of bytes . the modern astronomer is hardly bound by physical limitations . one can produce solid research sitting comfortably in front of one s personal computer . there are many examples of physically challenged individuals who have made successful careers in science . those who have seen the movie contact based on carl sagan s novel are familiar with the blind astronomer who is listening to radio signals instead of watching them on the screen . his character is based on a real scientist , dr . d. kent cullers . there are other success stories in fact , too many to enumerate here . but , you ask , is nt the sheer amount of information a major hindrance to those who can not browse it easily ? yes , it is to some degree . electronic textual materials provide both a possibility and a challenge for those with low vision . in theory , it is possible for almost anyone to access online information , but in practice , this requires know - how and proper tools . plenty of assistive technologies exist to overcome hindrances . the daisy standard for digital talking books has been an important tool for making electronic texts easy to browse . not all hindrances are in the visual domain . imagine an elderly astronomer who has the full use of his or her intelligence , but whose hands are shaking , and who might have some difficulty with pointing a mouse when navigating a webpage and filling out search forms . it is a challenging task for librarians and information specialists to make our services and search forms accessible to people with a diversity of abilities so that they can do the research necessary for building careers as active contributors in their chosen fields of research . but what does accessibility look like ? there is a pervasive myth that it looks boring . this is strictly not true . accessible design should be functional enough , not just pretty . with proper html code and other techniques , we can make the text compliant with technological aids . if the html coding is poor , a document may be impossible to open with such aids or it could be impossible to navigate the text . the author of this paper was involved with an university - wide accessibility project that was undertaken by the university of helsinki in 20052006 , with a follow up in 20082009 . it was recognized that accessibility must cover not only our physical surroundings , but also the online environment as well . in spring 2009 , we noticed that the new national online system for applying for university education was not accessible to blind students . the system was provided by the finnish ministry of education , and we challenged them to fix it . to our big surprise , they did , working in collaboration with us and the finnish federation of the visually impaired . figure 1 shows a page from the application system . it looks exactly the same both before and after accessibility changes were made . differences can be seen on the coding level , but otherwise one can not tell the old version from the new one by visual inspection alone . the change has resulted in a major functional improvement . the old version could not even be opened with assistive technology , and blind students could not use it . now they can . accessibility needs some muscle to drive it . it is not just about good people doing good deeds it is also about ensuring that everyone has access to things that matter to them . we need guidelines and standards , preferably with legislation to back them up . in the united states , section 508 of the rehabilitation act regulates purchases made with federal funding . it is about `` access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others . '' a market for accessible products helps big publishers to take accessibility into account . when a publisher has a large enough number of customers who need to buy accessible products , they will be motivated to sell accessible products . we also need strong standards . the world wide consortium has updated its web content accessibility guidelines ( wcag ) version 2 dates back to 2008 . this new version of wcag is meant to be a practical tool , evidenced by its three levels of accessibility : * a : minimum * aa : medium * aaa : as accessible as possible you will find a good wcag2 checklist online . the ideal thing to do would be to make your website as accessible as possible , but in practice you need to read the guidelines and identify the accessibility level best suited to serving your users . let s look at a concrete example by applying an a - level guideline to an existing search form . the guideline states : `` form inputs have associated text labels or , if labels can not be used , a descriptive title attribute . '' let s look at a part of an ads search form with its original coding . this piece of code is from the section which requires an object for selection . 0.2 in ` < input name = obj req value = yes type = checkbox > require object for selection ` 0.2 in let s add some more coding ( in boldface ) . rather than just a checkbox , we now have a text label . 0.2 in ` < input id = obj req name = obj req value = yes type = checkbox > < label for = obj req > require object for selection</label > ` 0.2 in figure 2 shows what has changed . the text label in question has been highlighted . it is no longer necessary to hit the small checkbox it is enough if you just click the associated text . this makes the box much easier to check . you can do clever things with html . there are however many other formats to consider : pdf , flash , and office products , to name just a few . no matter what the material at hand , it needs structure above all else . otherwise , a blind person who tries to read a text has to read everything from beginning to end and is not able to navigate to a chapter or a footnote . even pdf which used to be an accessibility nightmare can now boast of a structure to make it more accessible it s called tagged pdf . as a general guideline , no matter what kind of document you are writing , you will need to stick to structure . do you use subtitles that are bold and in a different font ? please , use proper titles instead and use styles to control the fonts and such . let s take a peek at an html page that has structure . there are tools to make the structure visible . the box in figure 3 has been done with a wave toolbar . this example is taken from planetary and space science . a good amount of structure has been revealed . the html structure of earth , moon and planets , shows next to nothing . its only structure is a references header , `` h2 references . '' there is no subtitle structure at all that you can jump to . most publishers make their electronic materials available in pdf format . usually , those files are without any structure . figure 4 shows the acrobat reader results of an accessibility quick check there is no structure . what is the current situation with different astronomy publishers and journals ? table 1 shows accessibility elements for a selection of publishers based on inspection of a few papers published in 2009 by university of helsinki astronomers . we asked some questions about the basic properties of each paper . is there html fulltext ? does it have structure ? and does the pdf have structure ? if not , are there at least pdf bookmarks ? you can see that these results leave a lot to hope for . the only consistently good results are from planetary and space science , which is published by elsevier . unfortunately , however , not all elsevier products are equally accessible . llcccc title & publisher & html & html & pdf & + & & fulltext & structure & structure & bookmarks + astronomy & astrophysics & edp sciences & yes & ok & no & yes + astrophysical journal & iop & yes & none & no & yes + monthly notices r.a.s . & wiley & yes & none & no & no + astron . nachrichten & wiley & no & & no & no + planetary space sci . & elsevier & yes & ok & yes & yes + earth , moon & planets & springer & yes & none & no & yes + elsevier was the winner of this brief check . it has been making some efforts to increase accessibility of its products , which sets a good example for other big publishers . have inspected the overall accessibility compliance and practices of major database vendors , elsevier included . even if major publishers are making some progress , it is not enough . there are also smaller publishers , and beyond that there are institutes and libraries producing their own online materials or making their own search forms . many of them are unaware of current accessibility standards . standards can seem difficult to apply . but really , they are easy to follow if we make the guidelines clear enough so that everyone can understand and use them . remember that new technologies are taken into use all the time . we will be constantly facing new challenges to make them accessible , but they will also bring new possibilities with them . there is one last thing that you need to be aware of do nt forget about copyright . it is not a given fact that a library can freely distribute electronic material to a patron who could then read it on a personal computer or some other device . the copyright laws in different countries vary surprisingly on this point . moreover , even when the right to access is written into a law , thus making special exceptions to copyright for disabled persons , a license agreement between a library and a publisher might take this right away for particular electronic materials or products . a publisher or a consortium will not allow you to do things that are not specifically stated in the signed agreement . please always remember to check the accessibility options in agreements you sign . to give an example , the current finnish national electronic library ( finelib ) consortium agreement with elsevier specifies that `` coursepacks in nonelectronic , non - print perceptible form ( e.g. braille ) may be offered for visually impaired .

{"article": "polluted white dwarfs ( typed with a suffix `` z '' ) provide an opportunity to investigate the ultimate fate of planetary systems . although planets have not yet been detected around white dwarfs , the evidence for the presence of planetary debris around these objects lies in their polluted atmospheres . approximately one quarter of white dwarfs show the presence of elements heavier than helium in their atmospheres and approximately one fifth of these have a mid - infrared ( ir ) excess that is consistent with a circumstellar , debris disc . more recently using the cosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble space telescope have shown that about half of da white dwarfs with effective temperatures ranging from 17000 k to 27000 k have polluted atmospheres . several detailed studies of polluted white dwarfs have uncovered large variations in the composition of the accreted material . based on a study of ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of a sample of white dwarfs ( 19000 < k ) , showed that the abundance diversity in the accreted material is similar to that observed among solar system meteorites , although the effect of selective radiative radiation pressure on accretion rate calculations was neglected . demonstrated that selective radiation pressure on trace elements , silicon for instance , shapes observed abundance patterns in hot white dwarfs ( k ) . after including this effect in their calculations , concluded that at least 27% of their white dwarf sample , which includes the sample , would be currently accreting , while in 29% of these objects , usually among the warmest in their sample , the effect of radiative levitation dominates the abundance pattern . the inclusion of this effect also leads to a reduction in the estimated accretion flow in some objects with k ( e.g. , wd0431 + 126 ) . an analysis of uv and optical spectra of two additional white dwarfs by show the accreting source to be of a rocky nature where the abundance of refractory elements is enhanced compared to volatile elements . also , showed that the cool , hydrogen - rich and magnetic white dwarf nltt 43806 ( typed dazh ) is enriched in aluminium but poor in iron which suggests that the accreting material is similar to the earth lithosphere . oxygen has been detected in several white dwarfs ( e.g. , galex j1931 + 0117 ; * ? ? ? * ) , and , in some of these objects , the amount of oxygen with respect to the other heavier elements detected suggests that the accreted material contains significant amount of water . for example , in gd 61 found that the accreted material contains oxygen in excess of the amount expected to be carried by metal oxides , suggesting that the parent material contained water . a similar finding , but with a higher fraction of water , was found in the case of sdss j124231.07.6 . the material accreted at the surface of a white dwarf is subjected to diffusion processes : trace elements are quickly mixed in the convective envelope of cool white dwarfs , and diffuse - out below the convection zone in a period of time much shorter than evolutionary timescales . recent estimates of diffusion timescales show that relics of an accretion event remain visible in the photosphere of a cool ( 6000 k ) hydrogen - rich white dwarf for nearly years and much longer ( several years ) for cool helium - rich white dwarfs . however , the observed abundance would follow details of the accretion history , and the presence of heavy elements is likely transitory when compared to the cooling age of old white dwarfs ( years ) . we present a spectroscopic and photometric analysis of an hitherto unknown cool , polluted white dwarf ( nltt 19868 ) from the revised nltt catalogue of . we provide details of the new observations in section 2 : we obtained new low- and high - dispersion spectra as well as new and archival photometric measurements allowing to build a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in section 3 , we analyse our new data and derive atmospheric parameters : temperature , surface gravity , and composition . next , in section 4 , we attempt to reconstruct recent accretion history onto this object . then , we draw a comparison with the sample of cool white dwarfs highlighting the peculiar photospheric composition of the cool white dwarf nltt 19868 , and , finally , we summarize our results . we present detailed spectroscopic and photometric observations of the newly identified white dwarf nltt 19868 . we first observed nltt 19868 with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) attached to the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla observatory on ut 2009 march 3 . using grism number 11 ( 300 lines / mm ) with the slit - width set to 1 arcsec , we obtained a resolution of . the two consecutive spectra of 1800 s each revealed a cool daz white dwarf with strong h&k lines . we followed up on our initial observations with four sets of echelle spectra of using the x - shooter spectrograph attached to the ut3 at paranal observatory on ut 2014 may 1 , 29 and june 1 . the slit - width was set to 0.5 , 0.9 and 0.6 arcsec for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . this setup provided a resolving power of 9900 , 7450 and 7780 for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . the exposure times for the uvb and vis arms were 2940 and 3000 s , respectively , and for the nir arm we obtained five exposures of 600 s each . we used the acquisition images from the efosc2 and x - shooter observations to obtain estimates of and magnitudes of nltt 19868 , respectively . first , we measured the instrumental magnitudes of nltt 19868 and of a brighter comparison star ( ra=08h 36 m 03.44s , dec= ) with published photometry ( mag , mag , mag , and mag ) from the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ) . apass is an all - sky survey conducted in five filters ( johnson and , and sloan , and ) with a magnitude range from approximately 10 up to 17 . we converted the sloan magnitude to the johnson magnitude using the transformation equations of lupton ( 2005): or we calculated using both equations and used the average of the two measurements ( mag ) . finally , using the difference between the instrumental magnitudes of nltt 19868 and the comparison star , we calculated mag and mag for nltt 19868 . note that the uncertainties for and are statistical only and neglect any possible systematic effects . we obtained ir photometric measurements from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) and w ide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ? the measurements which are all on the vega system are listed in table . the and measurements are not listed because only upper limits were available for this object . we have examined the wise images in combination with our x - shooter acquisition images . these images show that there is a nearby star 5.2 arcsec away at a position angle p.a . = 98 . the crowded star does not share the white dwarf proper motion and , consequently , is not physically related . using the proper motion of nltt 19868 the distance between the nearby star and nltt 19868 would have been 5.2 arcsec at p.a . = 107 at the time the wise images were obtained ( 2010 ) . since the point spread function ( psf ) of and are 6.1 and 6.4 arcsec , respectively , the wise photometric measurements listed in table should combine both nltt 19868 and the nearby object . the amount of contamination is unknown since the spectral type of the nearby star is unknown , although its sed shows it to be a cool object ( k ) . we have examined the 2mass images which show that nltt 19868 and the nearby object are clearly separated , and we conclude that the 2mass photometric measurements of nltt 19868 are not contaminated by the nearby star . the 2mass catalog did not contain any flags that would suggest problems with the photometry . .photometry and astrometry abundance studies of cool , hence old white dwarfs allow to determine the frequency of planetary debris at an advanced cooling age , i.e. , long after the parent star left the main - sequence . also , because of the longer diffusion timescales predicted in cool white dwarfs , diffusion effects may become more apparent , particularly following a discrete accretion event . in this case , a spread of diffusion timescales within a group of elements would lead to time - dependent alteration to abundance ratios allowing for a critical examination of the physical conditions at the base of the convection zone ( see * ? ? ? * ) . the number of cool daz white dwarfs remains low compared to the number of their hot daz counterparts , or to the helium - rich dz white dwarfs . concentrating our efforts on the hydrogen - rich sample may help establish whether their environment is similar to the more common dzs . in this context , our analysis of the cool daz white dwarf nltt 19868 and similar objects is timely . nltt 19868 lies among the coolest known daz white dwarfs . only three other daz white dwarfs have temperatures below 5500 k : g174 - 14 ( k , ) , nltt 10480 ( k , ) and g77 - 50 ( k , ) . the effective temperature adopted for g77 - 50 is the weighted average of the two measurements from and . fig . ( top panel ) plots the calcium abundance of all known cool daz white dwarfs with temperatures lower than 7000 k. the effective temperature for seven of these objects were updated with the results of . the calcium abundance varies by several orders of magnitudes , consistent with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this range of abundances is possibly a result of large variations in the accreted mass and of a possible time lapse since the last accretion event resulting in a diffusion - induced decline in the observed abundance . ( bottom panel ) also shows the fe / ca abundance ratio for stars with a measurable iron abundance . even though the sample is small , a large dispersion  in the fe / ca abundance ratio is observed . within the small sample of objects depicted in fig . , averages , which is lower than the bulk - earth abundance ratio of but is still consistent given the of the sample . we compared our cool sample to the larger sample of 50 polluted white dwarfs presented by which includes white dwarfs with k to k. our cool sample has a slightly smaller average but a larger dispersion than what is observed in the sample which has an average of and a . the likely reason for the difference in the dispersion is that in the hotter sample the dispersion is smaller than in the cooler sample and hence bringing down the dispersion in the sample . hence , the extrema at ( nltt 888 ; * ? ? ? * ) and ( nltt 19868 ) are notable . the abundance ratio observed in the nltt 888 is only second to that of the cool dz white dwarf sdss j1043 + 3516 ( , * ? ? ? * ) while fe / ca in nltt 19868 is slightly lower than in the cool daz nltt 43806 ( , * ? ? ? the observed abundance ratio in nltt 19868 is also the lowest known among known polluted white dwarfs , underlining the low relative abundance of fe with respect to the other detected elements . this abundance ratio is slightly lower than that of nltt 43806 ( =-0.2 , * ? ? ? . finally , the abundance ratio is among the lowest in polluted white dwarf atmospheres , in fact it is the second lowest after the heavily polluted dbaz gd 362 ( , * ? ? ? * ) . a comparison with the population of the 60 polluted white dwarfs showing mg , for which the average is with a dispersion of 0.4 , clearly places nltt 19868 at the magnesium - deficient end of the distribution . diffusion at the bottom of the convection zone alters the observed abundance pattern over a time period much shorter than cooling timescales . elements with short diffusion timescales relative to other elements are depleted faster and observed abundance ratios must vary over time . in a regime of steady state accretion , the hypothetical z1/z2 abundance ratio is simply given by while in the declining phase , i.e. , after mass accretion ceased , the time  dependent abundance ratio is given by where are the diffusion timescales at the bottom of the convection zone which is assumed to be homogeneously mixed . unfortunately , diffusion timescales are uncertain . few calculations are available for objects with effective temperatures below 6000 k. the abundance pattern in the accreted material is also uncertain and may , for example , correspond to solar ( see * ? ? ? * ) , bulk , core , or mantle earth . other types of material , based on an analogy with solar system bodies such as those of meteorites or asteroids can also be considered . a study of the fe / ca abundance ratio in the extreme cases of nltt 888 ( k ) and nltt 19868 ( k ) and of applicable scenarios supports intrinsic abundance variations in the accreted material with likely alterations brought upon by diffusion effects . the observed fe / ca ratio is 58 in nltt 888 and 0.59 in nltt 19868 . in both cases , steady - state accretion regime does not significantly alter the observed ratio relative to the parent material ratio . first , we examine the case of nltt 888 . interpolating the tables of between 5000 and 6000 k , we find and the abundance ratio in both media are nearly identical . using timescales from , , leads to the same conclusion . therefore , the estimated ratio in the accreted material fe / ca largely exceeds that of bulk- ( .4 ) or mantle - earth ( .8 ) suggesting that the accreted material in nltt 888 consists of 66% core material and 34% mantle using mass fractions converted to numbers fractions for these various media from and . considering that the fe / ca abundance ratio is likely to decrease over a diffusion time scale ( years ) in the eventuality that accretion is turned off , the inferred fraction of core material found in the parent body of the accreted material of nltt 888 must be considered a lower limit . the predominance of core iron material implies the likely presence of the , yet undetected , core elements such as nickel and sulfur . a significant amount of silicon ( 6% by mass , * ? * ) is also predicted to be present in the core , although if both core and mantle are to be accreted , most of the silicon would come from the mantle . among the larger population of polluted white dwarfs , including higher temperature stars , such as in the sample of iron - enrichment is also observed , for example , when compared to silicon , both pg 0843 and pg 1015 accrete material where the fe / si ratio is comparable to the core earth . however , a comparison of the fe / ca ratio for stars in their sample , galex 1931 is the one with the highest fe / ca ratio and is only slightly lower than that of nltt 888 . scenarios for nltt 19868 suggest that , on the contrary , core - type material is largely absent and that the accreted material is most likely composed of mantle - type material . assuming steady - state accretion , the low iron content in the atmosphere implies a similar deficiency in the parent material , i.e. , significantly lower than the earth s mantle composition . such a deficiency of iron in the parent material , i.e. , below that of the earth s mantle , may not be necessary . the observed fe / ca abundance ratio is well reproduced if the accretion of earth s mantle like material turned off years ago , allowing to further reduce the fe / ca abundance ratio in the convection zone to the observed level . note that diffusion timescales tabulated by are systematically longer than those tabulated by by up to a factor of three . the difference arises because the convection zone reaches deeper in envelope models used by where diffusion would operate in a denser medium . the depth of the convection zone at low temperatures ( k ) is not affected by the various treatments of the mixing length theory but , instead by different treatments of the equation - of - state and of the conductive opacity . interpolating the tables of and between 5000 and 6000 k , we find and 0.96 , respectively . assuming mantle composition in the source , the original fe / ca ratio of 1.8 would be reduced to the observed ratio of 0.59 in years following or a much longer time of years following . a longer elapsed time implied by the calculations of requires an unrealistically large accretion event  . using the shorter elapsed time implied by the calculations of results we can calculate an initial iron abundance of fe / h using : where the elapsed time since the accretion event is years and the diffusion timescale is years . assuming that the mass of the convection zone is and , then g , and the total mass of iron accreted onto the white dwarf is g , or , assuming an iron mass fraction of 6% in the mantle , the original accretion event would have weighed g. this mass corresponds to less than one thousandth of the mass of the earth  . the same diffusion scenario , but employing earth bulk material characterized by a higher fe / ca abundance ratio than in the mantle , would require a larger settling time scale ( elapsed time years ) to match the low , present - day fe / ca abundance ratio . assuming an accretion event as large as the convection zone itself , even calcium would have disappeared below the detection limit  after years . in summary , we have identified a new cool , polluted white dwarf showing strong lines of calcium among weaker lines of magnesium , aluminium , and iron . our model atmosphere analysis revealed the lowest iron to calcium abundance ratio of any cool polluted white dwarf . applying heavy element diffusion models , we found that the accretion event involving another peculiar daz white dwarf , nltt 888 , and that involving nltt 19868 are clearly distinguishable . the material accreted into the surface of nltt 888 is composed mainly of the iron - rich planetary core material , while the material accreted onto the surface of nltt 19868 is more akin to earth mantle material . in the case of nltt 19868 , the accretion event most likely occurred several diffusion timescales ago . although these scenarios appear reliable , details of the calculations rest upon uncertain diffusion timescale calculations . a.k . and s.v . acknowledge support from the grant agency of the czech republic ( 13 -

{"article": "the transformation , upon charge doping , of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator into a superconducting ( sc ) metal and the role of af correlations in the appearance of superconductivity have challenged researchers since the discovery of high- superconductivity in cuprates . is the af order an indispensable component or a competitor for the high- phenomenon ? in a prototype high- cuprate lasrcuo , the long - range af order is destroyed by doped holes way before the superconductivity sets in , which has led to a general belief that the spin frustration is a prerequisite for metallic conduction and superconductivity . the destructive impact of static spin order on superconductivity was further supported by the observation of sc suppression at a peculiar 1/8 doping in labacuo . on the other hand , spin excitations are often suggested to provide glue for sc pairing , implying the ultimate importance of af correlations , be they static or dynamic . besides , the incompatibility of static af order and sc may be not necessarily a general feature of cuprates . in bacuo ( is a rare - earth element ) , for instance , the long - range af order survives up to much higher doping levels than in lasrcuo , though the possibility of its coexistence with superconductivity still remains to be clarified . in strongly anisotropic high- cuprates , the -axis charge transport appears to be remarkably sensitive to the spin ordering in cuo planes . in bacuo crystals , for example , the -axis resistivity exhibits a steep increase at the nel temperature . even relatively weak modifications of the spin structure such as spin - flop or metamagnetic transitions result in surprisingly large changes by up to an order of magnitude in the -axis resistivity of both hole - doped lasrcuo and electron - doped prlacecuo and ndcecuo crystals . this sensitivity of the interplane charge transport in cuprates to the spin order can be , and actually is , employed for tracing the evolution of the spin state with doping , temperature , or magnetic fields . while electrical resistivity measurements have proved to be a very convenient tool for mapping the magnetic phase diagrams in cuprates , their usage has an obvious limitation ; namely , they fail as the superconductivity sets in . because of this limitation , previous resistivity studies of bacuo crystals could not clarify whether the long - range af order vanishes by the onset of superconductivity , or extends further , intervening the sc region . it sounds tempting to employ strong magnetic fields to suppress the superconductivity and to use the -axis resistivity technique of detecting the spin order in otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase diagram . in the present paper , we use this approach to study the very region of the af - sc transformation in lubacuo and ybacuo single crystals . bacuo single crystals with nonmagnetic rare - earth elements lu and y were grown by the flux method and their oxygen stoichiometry was tuned to the required level by high - temperature annealing with subsequent quenching . in order to ensure that no oxygen - enriched layer was formed at the crystal surface during the quenching process , one of the crystals was dissolved in acid in several steps ; resistivity measurements detected no considerable change in the sc transition upon the crystal s surface destruction . the -axis resistivity was measured using the ac four - probe technique . to provide a homogeneous current flow along the -axis , two current contacts were painted to almost completely cover the opposing -faces of the crystal , while two voltage contacts were placed in small windows reserved in the current ones . the magnetoresistance ( mr ) was measured by sweeping temperature at fixed magnetic fields up to 16.5 t applied along the axis of the crystals . a representative curve obtained for a lubacuo single crystal with a doping level slightly lower than required for the onset of superconductivity is shown in fig . 1 . in general , the -axis resistivity in bacuo crystals of non - sc composition exhibits two peculiar features upon cooling below room temperature , both of which can be seen in fig . 1 . the first one is a pronounced crossover at ( k for the particular composition in fig . 1 ) , indicating a change with decreasing temperature of the dominating conductivity mechanism from some kind of thermally activated hopping to a coherent transport . it is worth noting that a similar coherent - incoherent crossover was observed in other layered oxides as well . the second feature is a sharp growth of the resistivity associated with the long - range af ordering . if the crystals were less homogeneous , the low - temperature resistivity upturn would be easy to confuse with a usual disorder - induced charge localization . however , this sharp resistivity anomaly with a characteristic negative peak in the derivative ( inset in fig . 1 ) is definitely related to the spin ordering at the nel temperature : it has been traced from the parent compositions bacuo with well - known to avoid any doubt in its origin . , of a lubacuo single crystal . the sharp growth of the resistivity upon cooling below k is caused by the af ordering . inset : anomaly in the normalized derivative associated with the nel transition.,width=287 ] in carefully prepared crystals , the af transitions remain sharp for all compositions , including crystals with very low k , that is times lower than original k in parent bacuo . it is important to emphasize that the transitions at k remain virtually as sharp as in undoped parent crystals even though spin freezing into a spin - glass state is usually expected for such low temperatures and high hole concentrations . moreover , the impact of the af ordering on does not weaken with decreasing nel temperature ; as can be seen in fig . 1 , the resistivity of the crystal with k increases by more than 50% upon cooling below , while in crystals with k the corresponding growth does not exceed 15 - 20% . what do these observations tell about the impact of doped holes on copper spins ? apparently , the sharp af transitions are hard to reconcile with strongly frustrated spin states and disordered spin textures in cuo planes that are usually expected to emerge in cuprates with doping . besides , a strong frustration - induced reduction of the staggered magnetization required to account for the decrease in would necessarily diminish the impact of the interplane spin ordering on , which again disagrees with observations . on the other hand , if the role of mobile doped holes is not to introduce a uniform spin frustration , but simply to break the long - range af order into two - dimensional domains in cuo planes , the observed behavior is easier to understand . in this case , it is the af domains in cuo planes that become the elementary magnetic units and the long - range af state should develop through ordering of their phases , which can occur rather abruptly . correspondingly , the evolution with doping should be governed by the decreasing af domain size , rather than . in turn , the ordering of af domains whose local staggered magnetization does nor change appreciably with hole doping leaves room for large changes in the -axis resistivity even at low . the and values determined from the -axis resistivity of bacuo crystals have been used to establish the doping - temperature phase diagram in fig . 2 . a peculiarity of bacuo crystals is that their doping level is determined both by the oxygen content and by the degree of its ordering . for characterizing the doping level , we use therefore the in - plane conductivity instead of the oxygen content ; the former is a good measure of the hole density given that the hole mobility stays almost constant in the doping region under discussion . bacuo ( = lu , tm , y ) crystals near the af - sc transformation . the af and sc transition temperatures , and , are presented as a function of the in - plane conductivity which is a good measure of the hole density in the shown doping region . the nel temperature was determined either at the position of the jump ( middle point ) in the derivative ( open circles ) , or at the position of the negative peak in ( solid circles).,width=326 ] as can be seen in fig . 2 , the long - range af order in bacuo appears to be much more stable than in lasrcuo where it vanishes well in advance before the onset of superconductivity . in bacuo , the af phase boundary flattens upon approaching the sc compositions and hits the sc region , crossing the line at k . the observed overlap of the sc and af regions is very close to the area where sr studies of ybacuo ceramics revealed the coexistence of superconductivity with spontaneous static magnetism . given that the -axis resistivity studied here is sensitive to the interlayer spin ordering , the static magnetism detected by sr should in fact be related to the three - dimensional af order . the superconductivity in bacuo thus develops directly from the af - ordered state without any intervening paramagnetic or spin - glass region . cuo single crystal for two oxygen concentrations near the af - sc transformation . for the superconducting composition , the data were taken at several magnetic fields from zero up to 16.5 t applied along the axis . the sharp upturn in the resistivity associated with the nel transition shows up as the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field.,width=326 ] according to the established phase diagram ( fig . 2 ) , an increase of the hole density in cuo planes by % per cu ( from % to % , assuming the onset of superconductivity at % doping ) turns an af bacuo crystal without any sign of superconductivity into a bulk superconductor with k . what happens with the af order upon entering the sc region , does it vanish abruptly ? zero - field curves measured on the same lubacuo crystal for two hole doping levels ( that differ by .5 - 0.6% per cu ) indeed demonstrate a switch from an af state with sharply growing below to a sc state ( fig . however , when the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field , the steep increase in associated with the af ordering is recovered back ( fig . 3 ) . moreover , the recovered nel temperature is merely several kelvin lower than for the non - sc composition ( upper curve in fig . 3 ) and the resistivity increase is not reduced appreciably either . as long as the sc in lubacuo and ybacuo crystals is weak enough to be killed by the 16.5-t field , the unveiled curves keep demonstrating the anomalous growth below 15 - 20k associated with the nel transition . this behavior indicates that , at least when superconductivity is suppressed with magnetic fields , the af order extends to considerably higher doping levels than the sc onset . consequently , at zero magnetic field the af and sc orders either coexist with each other in a certain range of doping , or the af order is frustrated in the sc state but revives as the superconductivity is destroyed with the magnetic field . a switching between the af and sc orders was indeed suggested based on early sr studies , yet no further proofs were collected . the close location and even overlapping of the af and sc orders on the phase diagram raise another question of whether the af and sc orders reside in nanoscopically separated phases in cuo planes or coexist on the unit - cell scale , which calls for local microscopic tools to be clarified . j. m. tranquada , a. h. moudden , a. i. goldman , p. zolliker , d. e. cox , g. shirane , s. k. sinha , d. vaknin , d. c. johnston , m. s. alvarez , a. j. jacobson , j. t. lewandowski , and j. m. newsam , phys . rev . b * 38 * , 2477 ( 1988 ) .", "summary": "the remarkable sensitivity of the -axis resistivity and magnetoresistance in cuprates to the spin ordering is used to clarify the doping -

ray powder diffraction . the diffraction lines ( shown in fig. ) can be indexed with a tetragonal thcrsi type unit cell with lattice parameters and , in good agreement with those reported in ref .. the ac - susceptibility measurements were performed on heating with an ac field of 10 oe at 1111 hz . the real component ( fig. ) reveals the onset of diamagnetism and of bulk superconductivity below k. first - principles dft calculations of the electronic structure were performed using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method as implemented in the elk package . for the exchange - correlation functional we used the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof . the atomic positions used in the calculation are those obtained from room temperature x - ray diffraction . in order to calculate the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor components we solved the poisson equation for the charge distribution to determine the electrostatic potential and derived from where runs over the nuclei at . since the efg tensor is extremely sensitive to the charge distribution a well converged basis set is needed to grant the convergence with respect to the efg tensor components . we used muffin tin radii of 2.6 for rb and 2.4 for fe and as , with , where is the smallest muffin tin ( mt ) radius inside the mt spheres and the magnitude of the reciprocal space vectors . we choose 9 for the cut off of the angular momentum quantum number in the lattice harmonics expansion inside the mts . reciprocal space was sampled with the monkhorst - pack scheme on a grid . a smearing of 270 mev was used within the methfessel - paxton scheme and convergence of the efg components with respect to all these parameters has been carefully checked . once the efg tensor components are known the nqr frequency at as and rb can be calculated from eq . 1 in the main article . the obtained values ,  14.12 mhz and  6.7 mhz are in good agreement with the experimental values .6 mhz and  6.2 mhz and the discrepancy represents an estimate of the accuracy of the dft calculation which is known to not properly account for the electronic correlations . as nqr and rb nmr spectra were derived by recording the integral of the echo signal after a pulse sequence as a function of the irradiation frequency . at a few temperatures the as nqr spectra was also obtained by merging the fourier transforms of half of the echo recorded at different frequencies but no relevant additional features appeared in the spectra . we point out that any tiny amount of spurious phases as feas and feas ( not detected in x - ray diffraction ) will not affect the as nqr spectra since these materials are magnetically ordered and the internal field shifts the resonance frequency to much higher values . also in feas the as nqr line is in a completely different frequency range. the narrow rb nqr spectra were obtained from the fourier transform of half of the echo signal obtained after the same echo pulse sequence . rb nmr powder spectrum for the central transition is displayed in fig. . the spectrum is fully compatible with the rb quadrupole frequency determined from the nqr spectra . as spin - spin relaxation rate was derived in nqr by recording the decay of the echo amplitude after a pulse sequence . the decay could be fit in general with with . a value of lower than 2 and the slight temperature dependence of ( fig. ) should be associated with redfield contribution to the relaxation . then one can write , with the spin - spin relaxation rate . in case of an anysotropic spin - lattice relaxation rate , et al . calculated a general expression for . in case of a nuclear spin , with the axes of the efg along the axes one should have : where the symbols and refers to the external field orientation with respect to the crystallographic axis . in particular , corresponds to as nqr . was determined by assuming an anisotropy in equal to the one found in electron - doped bafeas . once the data have been corrected by redfield contribution one finds that as is temperature independent ( fig. ) , with . the deviation of from 2 , as it is expected in the case of nuclear dipolar interaction in a dense system is likely a consequence of the partial irradiation of the nqr spectrum . taking into account of corrections we have measured the -dependence of as nqr spectrum amplitude below 50 k and did not observe any significant change . rb nmr was measured in a tesla magnetic field by irradiating just the high frequency shoulder of the powder spectrum of the central line shown in fig. , corresponding to grains with the -axes perpendicular to . the recovery of rb nmr central line magnetization after a saturation recovery pulse sequence was fit according to the recovery is shown in fig. and one observes , similarly to what one finds in as nqr , two components appearing at low temperature . the long component were measured just in nmr since in nqr the very long rb relaxations and the much lower signal intensity make the measurements quite demanding . the fast component , the only one present at k , was measured in nqr irradiating either rb transition or rb . the recovery of nuclear magnetization was fit according to the recovery laws expected for a magnetic relaxation mechanism for rb and for rb . the ratio between the of the two nuclei for the fast relaxing component was measured at a few selected temperatures between 4 and 25 k and ( fig. ) , in good agreement with the ratio between the square of the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei , confirming the adequacy of the recovery laws we have used to estimate and the fact that the relaxation is driven by electron spin fluctuations . notice that if the relaxation was driven by efg fluctuations should scale with the square of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment and one should have a value about 50 times smaller than the experimental one . we have measured the frequency dependence of as across the nqr spectrum by decreasing the intensity of the radiofrequency field so that we irradiated a width of about 30 khz in the spectrum . we found that the recovery laws did not change significantly across the spectrum ( fig. ) . namely , , , and show a negligible frequency dependence . it should be mentioned that and appear to slightly depend on the thermal history ( i.e. on the cooling rate ) , an aspect that will be the subject of future studies . finally , we have checked that , the amplitude of the slow relaxing component , is zero above 20 k by recording the recovery up to more than ( fig. ) .", "summary": "as , rb and rb nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and rb nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements in rbfeas iron - based superconductor are presented . we observe a marked broadening of as nqr spectrum below k which is associated with the onset of a charge order in the feas planes . below we observe a power - law decrease in as nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate down to k. below the nuclei start to probe different dynamics owing to the different local electronic configurations induced by the charge order . a fraction of the nuclei probes spin dynamics associated with electrons approaching a localization while another fraction probes activated dynamics possibly associated with a pseudogap . these different trends are discussed in the light of an orbital selective behaviour expected for the electronic correlations . the parent compounds of high temperature superconducting cuprates are emblematic examples of mott - hubbard insulators at half band filling, where the large electron coulomb repulsion overcomes the hopping integral and induces both charge localization and an antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling among the spins . electronic correlations remain sizeable even when the cuprates become superconducting and give rise to a rich phase diagram at low hole doping levels characterized by the onset of a charge density wave ( cdw ) which progressively fades away as the doping increases and eventually , in the overdoped regime , a fermi liquid scenario is restored . the comprehension of the role of electronic correlations in iron - based superconductors ( ibs) is more subtle . at variance with the cuprates ibs are characterized by similar nearest neighbour and next - nearest neighbour hopping integrals , the parent compounds of the most studied families of ibs ( e.g. bafeas and lafeaso) are not characterized by half - filled bands and , moreover , in ibs the fermi level typically crosses five bands associated with the different fe 3 orbitals , leading to a rich phenomenology in the normal as well as in the superconducting state. moreover , even if signs have been reported , the evidence for a charge order in the phase diagram of ibs still remains elusive . nominally , half band filling can be approached in bafeas ibs by replacing ba with an alkali atom a = k , rb or cs , resulting in 5.5 electrons per fe atom. transport measurements show that afeas compounds are metals with sizeable electronic correlations and it has been recently pointed out that their behaviour shares many similarities with that of heavy fermion compounds. indeed , the effective mass progressively increases as one moves from bafeas to afeas, even if clear discrepancies in the values derived by the different techniques are found depending on their sensitivity to the electrons from a single band or from all the five bands. de medici et al . pointed out that if electronic correlations are sizeable , namely is of the order of the unity , the local atomic physics starts to be relevant and hund coupling may promote the single electron occupancy of fe orbitals ( i.e. half band - filling ) and decouple the interband charge correlations . accordingly the mott transition becomes orbital selective so that while the electrons of a given band localize the electrons of other bands remain delocalized , leading to a metallic behaviour and eventually to superconductivity . this orbital selective behaviour should give rise to markedly -dependent response functions and to a sort of -space phase separation of metallic and insulating - like domains . the point is , what happens in the real space ? will one probe the sum of the insulating and metallic response functions or should one detect a real space phase separation also in afeas ibs , with different local susceptibilities ? more interestingly , if electronic correlations become significant in afeas one could envisage the onset of a charge order as in the cuprates. nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) are quite powerful tools which allow to probe the local response function and charge distribution . moreover , in nqr experiments the magnetic field , which often acts as a relevant perturbation , is zero . here we show , by combining as and rb nqr and rb nmr measurements , that in rbfeas a charge order develops in the normal state below k , possibly leading to a differentiation in real space of fe atoms with different orbital configurations . below , as and rb nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rates  show a power law behaviour , as it is expected for a strongly correlated electron system and in good agreement with as nmr results reported by wu et al. . however , at k we observe that a fraction of as ( or rb ) nuclei probes spin dynamics characteristic of a system approaching localization while others probe dynamics possibly associated with a metallic phase with a pseudogap. upon further decreasing the temperature the volume fraction of the heavy electron phase vanishes while the one of the metallic phase , which eventually becomes superconducting below k , grows . thus , we present a neat evidence for a charge order in rbfeas akin to underdoped cuprates . the charge order favours a phase separation into metallic and nearly insulating regions , which could result from the theoretically predicted orbital selective behaviour. nqr and nmr measurements were performed on a rbfeas polycrystalline sample with a mass of about 400 mg , sealed in a quartz tube under a 0.2 bar ar atmosphere in order to prevent deterioration . the superconducting transition temperature derived from ac susceptibility measurements turned out k , in good agreement with previous findings . further details on the sample preparation and characterization are given in the supplemental material. first of all we shall discuss the appearance of a charge order in the feas planes of rbfeas , as detected by as nqr spectra . for a nuclear spin , as it is the case of as and rb , the nqr spectrum is characterized by a single line at a frequency with the nuclear quadrupole moment , the main component of the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor and its asymmetry . hence the nqr spectrum probes the efg at the nuclei generated by the surrounding charge distribution . above 140 k , as nqr spectrum ( fig. ) is centered around 14.6 mhz , with a linewidth of about 170 khz , while rb nqr spectrum is centered around 6.2 mhz with a width of about 20 khz . the relatively narrow nqr spectra confirms the good quality of our sample . we performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations using elk code in the generalized gradient approximation in order to derive ab initio the electric field gradient and nqr frequency . for as and rb we obtained mhz and mhz , respectively , in reasonable agreement with the experimental values in spite of the significant electronic correlations. this shows that dft is still able to provide a fair description of the system as far as it remains a normal metal . upon cooling the sample below k significant changes are detected in as nqr spectra ( fig . ) . the spectrum is observed to progressively broaden with decreasing temperature and below 50 k one clearly observes that the spectrum is actually formed by two humps nearly symmetrically shifted with respect to the center ( fig.a ) . the presence of two peaks in the as nqr spectra has already been detected in different families of ibs and associated with a nanoscopic phase separation in regions characterized by different electron doping levels. however , at variance with what we observe here , the two peaks observed in other ibs do not show the same intensity and the spectra show little temperature dependence , namely the nanoscopic phase separation is likely pinned . under both high magnetic field and high pressure an asymmetric splitting of as nmr spectrum was detected also in kfeas which , however , is absent in zero field ( nqr). here we observe the emergence of an nqr spectrum which recalls the one expected for an incommensurate cdw, which causes a periodic modulation of the efg at the nuclei and gives rise to two symmetrically shifted peaks in the spectrum . the efg modulation could involve also the onset of an orbital order or a structural distortion , possibly coupled to the charge order . although it is not straightforward from our data to discriminate among these scenarios , it is clear that we detect a symmetry breaking below to a low temperature phase characterized by a spatial modulation of the efg , namely by a charge order . rb nqr spectrum does not show a significant broadening upon decreasing the temperature but is characterized by a which , at k , shows a temperature dependence similar to that of the as nqr spectra full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , proportional to the charge order parameter ( fig.c ) . below rb flattens and deviates from as nqr fwhm . the fact that the nqr spectrum of the out of plane rb nuclei is less sensitive than as one to the charge order is an indication that the order develops in the feas planes and that the modulation of the efg at as nuclei should occur over a few lattice steps , otherwise one should expect a splitting also of the narrow rb nqr spectrum . it is interesting to notice that at a temperature of the order of an abrupt change in the uniaxial thermal expansion occurs, evidencing also a change in the lattice properties . now we discuss the temperature dependence of the low - energy dynamics probed by as and rb . the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate was determined from the recovery of the nuclear magnetization after exciting the nuclear spins with a saturation recovery pulse sequence . the recovery of as magnetization in nqr is shown in fig.a . one notices that a single exponential recovery describes very well the recovery of the nuclear magnetization at k , as it can be expected for a homogeneous system where all nuclei probe the same dynamics . however , below k one observes the appearance of a second component characterized by much longer relaxation times . namely , a part of the nuclei probes dynamics causing a fast relaxation  and a part of the nuclei a slow relaxation  . accordingly , the recovery was fit to \\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] with the nuclear magnetization at thermal equilibrium , and the fraction of fast relaxing and slow relaxing nuclei , respectively , a factor accounting for a non perfect saturation by the radiofrequency pulses and a stretching exponent characterizing the slowly relaxing component . as the temperature is lowered one observes a progressive increase of with respect to and at the lowest temperature ( k ) , about 80% of the nuclei are characterized by the slow relaxation ( fig.c ) . it is important to notice that in rbfeas wu et al. ( in nmr , not in nqr ) did not observe a clear separation of the recovery in two components as we do here but they did observe deviations from a single exponential recovery below 20 k which , however , were fitted with a stretched exponential , likely yielding an average value between and . remarkably also rb nmr clearly shows two components below 25 k and just one above. as was measured both on the high frequency and on the low - frequency shoulder of the nqr spectrum and it was found to be the same ( fig.a ) over a broad temperature range . moreover , at k we carefully checked the frequency dependence of , , and and found that neither the two relaxation rates nor their amplitude vary across the spectrum ( fig.b , see also ref . ) . this means that nuclei resonating at different frequencies probe the same dynamics which implies that the charge modulation induced by the charge order has a nanoscopic periodicity. one could argue that the two components are actually present at all temperatures but that they arise only at low temperature once nuclear spin diffusion is no longer able to establish a common spin temperature ( i.e. a common ) among the nuclei resonating at different frequencies . however , we remark that since the nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate  is constant and the width of the nqr spectrum is nearly constant below 40 k ( fig.c ) the poor efficiency of nuclear spin diffusion should not vary , at least for k. hence , the appearance of different relaxation rates below should arise from a phase separation causing a slight change in the average electronic charge distribution causing little effect on the nqr spectra ( see fig . ) but a marked differentiation in the low - energy excitations , which starts to be significant at low temperature once the effect of electronic correlations is relevant . one has to clarify if the relaxation mechanism is magnetic , driven by electron spin fluctuations , or quadrupolar , driven by efg fluctuations , typically induced by cdw amplitude and phase modes. in order to clarify this point we measured the ratio between rb and rb ( fast component ) at a few selected temperatures below 25 k. the ratio , in good agreement with the ratio between the square of the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei , showing that the relaxation is driven by the correlated spin fluctuations and not by charge fluctuations associated with cdw excitations . since as shows a temperature dependence of the relaxation analogous to the one of rb ( fig.a ) we argue that also as is driven by spin fluctuations . thus we can write that the form factor giving the hyperfine coupling with the collective spin excitations at wave - vector , and the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility at the resonance frequency . now we turn to the temperature dependence of above k and of and below that temperature . above increases with a power law , with for as , and flattens around k ( fig.a ) , in very good agreement with the results reported by wu et al. from as nmr . notice that corresponds to the temperature below which we start to observe a significant broadening of as nqr spectrum . hence , the power law behaviour of seems to arise from the onset of the charge order . below k deviates from the power law behaviour and progressively flattens on decreasing temperature ( fig.a ) . the same behaviour is detected for rb nmr , although the flattening starts at a higher temperature , suggesting that might be field dependent . on the other hand , gets progressively longer as the temperature is lowered and follows an activated trend with an energy barrier k. the behaviour of is characteristic of a system approaching a qcp where localization occurs . in fact , from moriya self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) approach for a quasi-2d system with af correlations , one should have , with the static susceptibility at the af wave - vector . in the proximity of the qcp , leading to a weak logarithmic divergence of for , while at higher temperature should show a curie - weiss behaviour , yielding a nearly flat , as we do observe in rbfeas ( fig.a ) . the corresponding behaviour of is reported in fig.b . on the other hand , , corresponding to the relaxation rate of the majority phase at low temperature , shows the opposite trend ( fig.b ) , decreasing upon cooling . being the system metallic at low temperature , the deviation of from the constant korringa - like behaviour expected for a metal should possibly be associated with the opening of a pseudogap , similarly to what one observes in the underdoped regime of the cuprates, and in agreement with theoretical predictions for hole - doped ibs. in conclusion , our results show that , akin to cuprates , a charge order develops also in the normal state of ibs when the electronic correlations are sizeable . accordingly , the presence of a charge order appears to be a common feature in the phase diagram of cuprate and iron - based superconductors and could play a key role in determining the superconducting state properties. moreover , we observe a local electronic separation in two phases characterized by different excitations which could possibly be explained in terms of the orbital selective behaviour predicted for ibs . finally we remark that the occurrence of an electronic phase separation is theoretically supported by a recent study of the electron fluid compressibility ."}
{"article": "the statistical mechanics of pure systems most prominently the topic of phase transitions and their associated surface phenomena has been a subject of fairly intensive research in recent years . several physical principles for pure systems ( the gibbs phase rule , wulff construction , etc . ) have been put on a mathematically rigorous footing and , if necessary , supplemented with appropriate conditions ensuring their validity . the corresponding phenomena in systems with several mixed components , particularly solutions , have long been well - understood on the level of theoretical physics . however , they have not received much mathematically rigorous attention and in particular have not been derived rigorously starting from a local interaction . a natural task is to use the ideas from statistical mechanics of pure systems to develop a higher level of control for phase transitions in solutions . this is especially desirable in light of the important role that basic physics of these systems plays in sciences , both general ( chemistry , biology , oceanography ) and applied ( metallurgy , etc . ) . see e.g. for more discussion . among the perhaps most interesting aspects of phase transitions in mixed systems is a dramatic phase separation in solutions upon freezing ( or boiling ) . a well - known example from `` real world '' is the formation of brine pockets in frozen sea water . here , two important physical phenomena are observed : 1 . migration of nearly all the salt into whatever portion of ice / water mixture remains liquid . clear evidence of facetting at the water - ice boundaries . quantitative analysis also reveals the following fact : 1 . salted water freezes at temperatures lower than the freezing point of pure water . this is the phenomenon of freezing point depression . phenomenon ( 1 ) is what `` drives '' the physics of sea ice and is thus largely responsible for the variety of physical effects that have been observed , see e.g. . notwithstanding , ( 13 ) are not special to the salt - water system ; they are shared by a large class of the so called non - volatile solutions . a discussion concerning the general aspects of freezing / boiling of solutions often referred to as colligative properties can be found in . of course , on a heuristic level , the above phenomena are far from mysterious . indeed , ( 1 ) follows from the observation that , macroscopically , the liquid phase provides a more hospitable environment for salt than the solid phase . then ( 3 ) results by noting that the migration of salt increases the entropic cost of freezing so the energy - entropy balance forces the transition point to a lower temperature . finally , concerning observation ( 2 ) we note that , due to the crystalline nature of ice , the ice - water surface tension will be anisotropic . therefore , to describe the shape of brine pockets , a wulff construction has to be involved with the caveat that here the crystalline phase is on the outside . in summary , what is underlying these phenomena is a phase separation accompanied by the emergence of a crystal shape . in the context of pure systems , such topics have been well understood at the level of theoretical physics for quite some time and , recently ( as measured on the above time scale ) , also at the level of rigorous theorems in two and higher dimensions . the purpose of this and a subsequent paper is to study the qualitative nature of phenomena ( 13 ) using the formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics . unfortunately , a microscopically realistic model of salted water / ice system is far beyond reach of rigorous methods . ( in fact , even in pure water , the phenomenon of freezing is so complex that crystalization in realistic models has only recently and only marginally been exhibited in computer simulations . ) thus we will resort to a simplified version in which salt and both phases of water are represented by discrete random variables residing at sites of a regular lattice . for these models we show that phase separation dominates a non - trivial region of chemical potentials in the phase diagram a situation quite unlike the pure system where phase separation can occur only at a single value ( namely , the transition value ) of the chemical potential . the boundary lines of the phase - separation region can be explicitly characterized and shown to agree with the approximate solutions of the corresponding problem in the physical - chemistry literature . the above constitutes the subject of the present paper . in a subsequent paper we will demonstrate that , for infinitesimal salt concentrations scaling appropriately with the size of the system , phase separation may still occur dramatically in the sense that a non - trivial fraction of the system suddenly melts ( freezes ) to form a pocket ( crystal ) . in these circumstances the amount of salt needed is proportional to the boundary of the system which shows that the onset of freezing - point depression is actually a surface phenomenon . on a qualitative level , most of the aforementioned conclusions should apply to general non - volatile solutions under the conditions when the solvent freezes ( or boils ) . notwithstanding , throughout this and the subsequent paper we will adopt the language of salted water and refer to the solid phase of the solvent as ice , to the liquid phase as liquid - water , and to the solute as salt . our model will be defined on the -dimensional hypercubic lattice . we will take the ( formal ) nearest - neighbor hamiltonian of the following form : here is the inverse temperature ( henceforth incorporated into the hamitonian ) , and are sites in and denotes a neighboring pair of sites . the quantities , and are the ice ( water ) , liquid ( water ) and salt variables , which will take values in with the additional constraint valid at each site . we will say that indicates the presence of ice at and , similarly , the presence of liquid at . since a single water molecule can not physically be in an ice state , it is natural to interpret the phrase as referring to the collective behavior of many particles in the vicinity of which are enacting an ice - like state , though we do not formally incorporate such a viewpoint into our model . the various terms in are essentially self - explanatory : an interaction between neighboring ice points , similarly for neighboring liquid points ( we may assume these to be attractive ) , an energy penalty for a simultaneous presence of salt and ice at one point , and , finally , fugacity terms for salt and liquid . for simplicity ( and tractability ) , there is no direct salt - salt interaction , except for the exclusion rule of at most one salt `` particle '' at each site . additional terms which could have been included are superfluous due to the constraint . we will assume throughout that , so that the salt - ice interaction expresses the negative affinity of salt to the ice state of water . this term is entirely and not subtly responsible for the general phenomenon of freezing point depression . we remark that by suitably renaming the variables , the hamiltonian in would just as well describe a system with boiling point elevation . as we said , the variables and indicate the presence of ice and liquid water at site , respectively . the assumption guarantees that something has to be present at ( the concentration of water in water is unity ) ; what is perhaps unrealistic is the restriction of and to only the extreme values , namely . suffice it to say that the authors are confident ( e.g. , on the basis of ) that virtually all the results in this note can be extended to the cases of continuous variables . however , we will not make any such mathematical claims ; much of this paper will rely heavily on preexisting technology which , strictly speaking , has only been made to work for the discrete case . a similar discussion applies , of course , to the salt variables . but here our restriction to is mostly to ease the exposition ; virtually all of our results directly extend to the cases when takes arbitrary ( positive ) real values according to some a priori distribution . it is not difficult to see that the `` ice - liquid sector '' of the general hamiltonian reduces to a ferromagnetic ising spin system . on a formal level , this is achieved by passing to the ising variables , which in light of the constraint gives by substituting these into , we arrive at the interaction hamiltonian : where the new parameters and are given by we remark that the third sum in is still written in terms of `` ice '' indicators so that will have a well defined meaning even if , which corresponds to prohibiting salt entirely at ice - occupied sites . ( notwithstanding , the bulk of this paper is restricted to finite . ) using an appropriate restriction to finite volumes , the above hamitonian allows us to define the corresponding gibbs measures . we postpone any relevant technicalities to section . the hamiltonian as written foretells the possibility of fluctuations in the salt concentration . however , this is not the situation which is of physical interest . indeed , in an open system it is clear that the salt concentration will , eventually , adjust itself until the system exhibits a pure phase . on the level of the description provided by it is noted that , as grand canonical variables , the salt particles can be explicitly integrated , the result being the ising model at coupling constant and external field , where in this context , phase coexistence is confined to the region , i.e. , a simple curve in the -plane . unfortunately , as is well known , not much insight on the subject of phase separation is to be gained by studying the ising magnet in an external field . indeed , under ( for example ) minus boundary conditions , once exceeds a particular value , a droplet will form which all but subsumes the allowed volume . the transitional value of scales inversely with the linear size of the system ; the exact constants and the subsequent behavior of the droplet depend on the details of the boundary conditions . the described `` failure '' of the grand canonical description indicates that the correct ensemble in this case is the one with a fixed amount of salt per unit volume . ( the technical definition uses conditioning from the grand canonical measure ; see section . ) this ensemble is physically more relevant because , at the moment of freezing , the salt typically does not have enough `` mobility '' to be gradually released from the system . it is noted that , once the total amount of salt is fixed , the chemical potential drops out of the problem the relevant parameter is now the salt concentration . as will be seen in section , in our ising - based model of the solvent - solute system , fixing the salt concentration generically leads to sharp phase separation in the ising configuration . moreover , this happens for an interval of values of the magnetic field . indeed , the interplay between the salt concentration and the actual external field will demand a particular value of the magnetization , even under conditions which will force a droplet ( or ice crystal , depending on the boundary condition ) into the system . we finish by noting that , while the parameter is formally unrelated to temperature , it does to a limited extent play the role of temperature in that it reflects the a priori amount of preference of the system for water vs ice . thus the natural phase diagram to study is in the -plane . the reasoning which led to formula allows for an immediate heuristic explanation of our principal results . the key simplification which again boils down to the absence of salt - salt interaction is that for any ising configuration , the amalgamated contribution of salt , i.e. , the gibbs weight summed over salt configurations , depends only on the overall magnetization and not on the details of how the magnetization gets distributed about the system . in systems of linear scale , let denote the canonical partition function for the ising magnet with constrained overall magnetization . the total partition function at fixed salt concentration can then be written as where denotes the sum of the salt part of the boltzmann weight which only depends on the ising spins via the total magnetization over all salt configurations with concentration . as usual , the physical values of the magnetization are those bringing the dominant contribution to the sum in . let us recapitulate the standard arguments by first considering the case ( which implies ) , i.e. , the usual ising system at external field . here we recall that can approximately be written as },\\ ] ] where is a suitably chosen constant and is a ( normalized ) canonical free energy . the principal fact about is that it vanishes for in the interval ] . in finite volume , we take this to mean that the total amount of salt , is fixed . to simplify future discussions , we will adopt the convention that `` concentration '' means that , i.e. , . we may then define the finite volume gibbs probability measure with salt concentration and plus ( or minus ) boundary conditions denoted by ( or ) . in light of , these are given by the formulas both measures depend on the parameters and in the hamiltonian . however , we will always regard these as fixed and suppress them from the notation whenever possible . in order to describe our first set of results , we will need to bring to bear a few standard facts about the ising model . for each spin configuration let us define the overall magnetization in by the formula let denote the magnetization of the ising model with coupling constant and external field . as is well known , cf the proof of theorem , continuously ( and strictly ) increases from the value of the spontaneous magnetization to one as sweeps through . in particular , for each , there exists a unique such that . next we will use the above quantities to define the function , which represents the canonical free energy of the ising model in . as it turns out see theorem in section we simply have as already mentioned , if , where is the critical coupling constant of the ising model , then and thus for ] . ) for each , each ] , let as we will show in section , this quantity represents the entropy of configurations with fixed salt concentration , fixed overall magnetization and fixed fraction of the salt residing `` on the plus spins '' ( and fraction `` on the minus spins '' ) . having defined all relevant quantities , we are ready to state our results . we begin with a large - deviation principle for the magnetization in the measures : let and be fixed . for each , each and each , we have here is given by }{} {h , c}(m,\\theta),\\ ] ] where the function is finite and strictly convex on with . furthermore , the unique minimizer of is continuous in both and and strictly increasing in . on the basis of the above large - deviation result , we can now characterize the typical configurations of the measures . consider the ising model with coupling constant and zero external field and let be the corresponding gibbs measure in volume and -boundary condition . our main result in this section is then as follows : let and be fixed . let and , and define two sequences of probability measures on ] are uniquely determined by the equations 2 . the measure converges weakly to a point mass at , in particular , the ising - spin marginal of the measure is asymptotically supported on the usual ising spin configurations with the overall magnetization , where minimizes . the fact that conditioning on a fixed value of magnetization produces the ising measure under same conditioning which is the content of is directly related to the absence of salt - salt interaction . the principal conclusions of the previous theorem are thus parts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , which state that the presence of a particular amount of salt forces the ising sector to choose a particular value of magnetization density . the underlying variational principle provides insight into the physical mechanism of phase separation upon freezing of solutions . ( we refer the reader back to section for the physical basis of these considerations . ) we will proceed by discussing the consequences of these results for the phase diagram of the model and , in particular , the phenomenon of freezing point depression . theorems and are proved in section . . the horizontal axis marks the concentration of the salt in the system , the vertical line represents the external field acting on the ising spins see formula . for positive concentrations , the system stays in the liquid - water phase throughout a non - trivial range of negative values of a manifestation of the freezing - point depression . for in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system is frozen into ice . once is on the left of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of , the type of convexity of the transition lines may change from concave to convex near ; see the companion paper . , width=336 ] . the horizontal axis marks the concentration of the salt in the system , the vertical line represents the external field acting on the ising spins see formula . for positive concentrations , the system stays in the liquid - water phase throughout a non - trivial range of negative values of a manifestation of the freezing - point depression . for in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system is frozen into ice . once is on the left of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of , the type of convexity of the transition lines may change from concave to convex near ; see the companion paper . , width=336 ] the representation along with the asymptotic allow us to characterize the distribution in terms of the canonical ensemble of the ising ferromagnet . indeed , these formulas imply that the distribution of ising spins induced by is very much like that in the measure conditioned on the event that the overall magnetization is near the value . as a consequence , the asymptotic statements ( e.g. , the wulff construction ) that have been ( or will be ) established for the spin configurations in the ising model with fixed magnetization will automatically hold for the spin - marginal of the as well . a particular question of interest in this paper is phase separation . recall that denotes the spontaneous magnetization of the ising model at coupling . then we can anticipate the following conclusions about typical configurations in measure : 1 . if , then the entire system ( with plus boundary condition ) will look like the plus state of the ising model whose external field is adjusted so that the overall magnetization on the scale is roughly . 2 . if , then the system ( with minus boundary condition ) will look like the ising minus state with similarly adjusted external field . if , then , necessarily , the system exhibits phase separation in the sense that typical configurations feature a large droplet of one phase inside the other . the volume fraction taken by the droplet is such that the overall magnetization is near . the outer phase of the droplet agrees with the boundary condition . the cases ( 1 - 2 ) with opposite boundary conditions that is , the minus boundary conditions in ( 1 ) and the plus boundary conditions in ( 2)are still as stated ; the difference is that now there has to be a large contour near the boundary flipping to the `` correct '' boundary condition . we have no doubt that the aforementioned conclusions ( 1 - 3 ) hold for all and all ( with a proper definition of the droplet in part ( 3 ) , of course ) . however , the depth of conclusion ( 3 ) depends on the level of understanding wulff construction , which is at present rather different in dimensions and . specifically , while in the results of allow us to claim that for all and all magnetizations , the system will exhibit a unique large contour with appropriate properties , in this statement is known to hold only in `` -sense '' and only for which are near the endpoints . ( moreover , not all values of are , in principle , permitted ; cf for a recent improvement of these restrictions . ) we refer to for an overview of the situation . notwithstanding the technical difficulties of wulff construction , the above allows us to characterize the phase diagram of the model at hand . as indicated in fig . , the and quadrant splits into three distinct parts : the liquid - water region , the ice region and the phase separation region , which correspond to the situations in ( 1 - 3 ) , respectively . the boundary lines of the phase - separation region are found by setting which in light of strict monotonicity of allows us to calculate as a function of . the solutions of can be obtained on the basis of the following observation : let ] and define the quantities by . let be the solution to . then we have : in particular , there exist two continuous and decreasing functions ] , where is as in and is as defined in . proof the claim is considered standard , see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * section ii.1 ) , and follows by a straightforward application of the thermodynamic relations between the free energy , magnetization and external field . for completeness ( and reader s convenience ) we will provide a proof . consider the function , where is the expectation with respect to , and let . the limit exists by subadditivity arguments and is independent of the boundary condition . the function is convex on , real analytic ( by the lee - yang theorem ) on , and hence it is strictly convex on . by the symmetry there is a cusp at whenever . it follows that for each there is a unique such that , with increasing continuously from to as increases from to . the plus - minus symmetry shows that a similar statement holds for the magnetizations in ] . by the above properties of we infer that when and , while for ]which is the set of so called exposed points of . since and the derivative of is , this is given by the integral in . to prove when ] as well . the `` first '' part of the grtner - ellis theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem v.6 ) actually guarantees the following large - deviation principle : for any closed set while }\\phi^\\star(m)\\ ] ] for any open set . ( here for ] cases i.e , the non - exposed points have to be dealt with separately . the above is the core of our proof of theorem . the next step will be to bring the quantities and into play . this , as we shall see , is easily done if we condition on the total magnetization . ( the cost of this conditioning will be estimated by . ) indeed , as a result of the absence of salt - salt interaction , the conditional measure can be rather precisely characterized . let us recall the definition of the quantity from which represents the total amount of salt in the system . for any spin configuration and any salt configuration , let us introduce the quantity representing the total amount of salt `` on the plus spins . '' then we have : for any fixed spin configuration , all salt configurations with the same and have the same probability in the conditional measure . moreover , for any with and for any ] for which satisfy ] imply that , , , , and all scale proportionally to , uniformly in and , while and are bounded by which by our assumption is less than we are in a regime where it makes sense to seek an asymptotic form of quantity . using the bounds which are valid for all integers and with , we easily find that since and as , while , , and stay bounded , the desired claim follows by taking sufficiently large . the reader may have noticed that , in most of our previous arguments , and were restricted to be away from the boundary values . to control the situation near the boundary values , we have to prove the following claim : for each and each , let be the event then for each and each there exists an such that proof we will split the complement of into four events and prove the corresponding estimate for each of them . we begin with the event . the main tool will be stochastic domination by a product measure . consider the usual partial order on spin configurations defined by putting whenever for all . let be the conditional probability that occurs given a spin configuration in and a salt configuration in , optimized over all , and also and the system size . since reduces to ( the exponential of ) the local interaction between and its ultimate neighborhood , we have . using standard arguments it now follows that the spin marginal of stochastically dominates the product measure defined by for all . in particular , we have let . then namely , the expectation of with respect to exceeds the negative of and so cramr s theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem i.4 ) or ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.1.24 ) ) implies that the probability on the right - hand side decays to zero exponentially in , i.e. , the opposite side of the interval of magnetizations , namely , the event , is handled analogously ( with now focusing on instead of ) . the remaining two events , marking when is either less than or larger than times the total number of plus spins , are handled using a similar argument combined with standard convexity estimates . let us consider the event which contains the event and let us emphasize the dependence of the underlying probability distribution on by writing as . let denote the expectation with respect to and note that . we begin by using the chernoff bound to get a routine application of jensen s inequality gives us it thus suffices to prove that there exists a such that is positive . ( indeed , we take to be strictly less than this number and set to observe that the right - hand side decays exponentially in . ) to show this we write as the sum of over all . looking back at , we then have , where is now evaluated for , and so thus , once , the probability decays exponentially in . as to the complementary event , , we note that this is contained in , where counts the number of plus spins with no salt on it . since we still have , the proof boils down to the same argument as before . on the basis of the above observations , the proofs of our main theorems are easily concluded . however , instead of theorem we will prove a slightly stronger result of which the large - deviation part of theorem is an easy corollary . let and be fixed . for each , each and each , let be the set of all for which and hold . then } { } {h , c}(m',\\theta'),\\ ] ] where is as in . proof since the size of the set depends only on the overall magnetization , let denote this size for the configurations with . first we note that , by lemma , where here is the normalization constant from which in the present formulation can also be interpreted as the sum of over the relevant ( discrete ) values of and . let denote the sum of over all and for which and are integers and and . ( this is exactly the set of magnetizations and spin - salt overlaps contributing to the set . ) applying to extract the exponential behavior of the last probability in , and using to do the same for the quantity , we get where is as in . as a consequence of the above estimate we have for any and any . next we will attend to the denominator in . pick and consider the set latexmath: we know that decays exponentially in and so the decisive contribution to comes from . assuming that , let us cover by finite number of sets of the form \\times ] . ) now , since minimizes for a given , the strict convexity of on implies that for any , hence , is also strictly convex . the fact that diverges as is a consequence of the corresponding property of the function and the fact that the rest of is convex in . as a consequence of strict convexity and the abovementioned `` steepness '' at the boundary of the interval , the function has a unique minimizer for each and , as long as the quantities from satisfy . the minimizer is automatically continuous in and is manifestly non - decreasing . furthermore , the continuity of in allows us to conclude that is also continuous in . what is left of the claims is the strict monotonicity of as a function of . writing as and noting that is continuously differentiable on , the minimizing satisfies but is also strictly convex and so is strictly increasing . it follows that has to be strictly increasing with . theorem has the following simple consequence that is worth highlighting : for given and , let be the minimizer of . then for all , proof on the basis of and the fact that has a unique minimizer , a covering argument same as used to prove implies that the probability on the left - hand side decays to zero exponentially in . before we proceed to the proof of our second main theorem , let us make an observation concerning the values of at the minimizing and : let and be fixed and let be the minimizer of . define the quantities by and by . then moreover , are then related to via whenever ] . as is easily shown , the first equation in corresponds to an increasing curve in ^ 2 ] we can disregard the part of the function ( because its vanishes along with its derivative throughout this interval ) , so we have a straightforward calculation then yields . now we are ready to prove our second main result : proof of theorem the crucial technical step for the present proof has already been established in lemma . in order to plug into the latter result , let us note that the sum of over all salt configurations with is a number depending only on the total magnetization . lemma then implies where is a positive number depending on , the parameters , , and the boundary condition but not on the event . noting that is simply the distribution of the random variables in measure , this proves . in order to prove the assertion , we let , pick and fix . since lemma guarantees that , given , all salt configurations with fixed and concentration have the same probability in , we have where is defined in . pick and assume , as in lemma , that ] and for some with . then the aforementioned lemma tells us that is within of the probability that occurs in the product measure where the probability of is if and if . let be the unique minimizer of . taking expectation of over with fixed , using corollary to discard the events or and invoking the continuity of in and , we find out that indeed converges to with evaluated at the minimizing . but for this choice lemma guarantees that , which finally proves  . the last item to be proved is proposition establishing the basic features of the phase diagram of the model under consideration : proof of proposition from lemma we already know that the set of points for ] . let us introduce new variables and , writing in in terms of , let us differentiate with respect to .

{"article": "compact symmetric objects ( csos ) are a family of extragalactic radio sources comprising roughly 3% of flux - limited samples selected at high frequencies ( taylor , readhead , & pearson 1996 ; peck & taylor 2001 ) . their defining characteristic is the presence of high luminosity radio components on both sides of a central engine on sub - kiloparsec scales with little or no extended emission present . csos typically exhibit terminal hotspots which move apart at subluminal speeds ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . jet components en route between the core and the hot spots where they terminate , appear to move faster , and superluminal speeds in the jets are seen in a few sources ( taylor , readhead & pearson 2000 ) . the jets can be similar or much brighter than the counterjets . csos on the whole exhibit weak radio variability , have low radio polarization and low core luminosities . their hosts are in general elliptical galaxies ( readhead et al . 1996 ) though there are a few notable exceptions identified with seyferts and quasars . the general picture that has emerged is that csos are young radio galaxies , with ages between 100 and 10000 years . since they are selected on the basis of relatively unbeamed hot - spots and lobes , their orientation on the sky is random . orientation may still affect the presence of detectable linear polarization ( gugliucci et al . 2007 ) , or absorption from atomic gas associated with the hypothesized gas and dust torus that surrounds the central engine and is thought to be oriented perpendicular to the jet axis ( peck et al . 2000 ; pihlstrm et al . 2003 ) . however , as doppler boosting effects are less dominant , we have the added benefit of studying the emission from both sides of the nucleus . csos provide a unique opportunity to determine the hubble constant , as a direct measurement of the distance to an object can be obtained by observing angular motion in it , if the intrinsic linear velocity can be ascertained independently . basically , one has the time derivative of a standard ruler , with the additional constraint that no intrinsic motion can be faster than light . from five epochs of observations of the cso 1946 + 708 at 5 ghz taylor & vermeulen ( 1997 ) placed a lower limit of h 37 km s mpc . we explore what can be learned from continuing this analysis using more comprehensive observations . we also use this symmetric system , for which the geometry of the jets can be precisely determined , to probe the details of jet propagation . kinematic ages for the radio emission in csos can be obtained by measuring the separation speed between the hot spots over time and comparing this to the overall spatial separation ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . 2005 ) . at the moment , the cso age distribution seems to be disproportionally stacked towards younger sources . however , there are a number of selection effects that need to be addressed before the meager data collected can be properly analyzed . larger sources are over - resolved by vlbi observations so that measuring the expansion becomes difficult ; more slowly expanding sources require longer time baselines to obtain age estimates . in this work we present observations of the cso 1946 + 708 spanning 16 years . it is of considerable interest to pursue this line of research to address the evolution of radio galaxies . we assume = 71 km s mpc and the standard cosmology so that 1= 1.835 kpc and an angular velocity of 1 mas / y = 5.98 c at the redshift ( 0.1008 ) of the radio galaxy 1946 + 708 ( peck & taylor 2001 ) . the observations were carried out at 8.4 ghz and 15.4 ghz over the course of eight epochs , taken on 1995 march 22 , 1996 july 07 , 1998 february 06 , 1999 july 11 , 2001 may 17 , and at 8.4 ghz only on 2003 jan 24/2003 feb 10 , 2006 feb 18 , and 2008 mar 9 ( see table 1 ) . observations in 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 were observed using all ten elements of the vlba of the nrao , and observations from 2003 on were observed using a global array including all ten elements of the vlba , and five elements from the european vlbi network ( evn ) including the 100 m telescope at effelsberg , the westerbork phased array , onsala , medicina , and in 2003 only , the telescope at noto . due to problems at the st . croix and north liberty stations , epochs in 1996 and 1999 were performed using nine vlba antennas each . problems in 2003 prevented effelsberg from participating . both right and left circular polarizations were recorded for the first 5 epochs , while the last three where observed only in right circular polarization . all epochs employed 2 bit sampling across if bandwidths of 8 mhz . the vlba correlator produced 16 frequency channels across each if during every 2 s integration . we also include in our analysis the 5 ghz observations acquired between 1992 and 1995 by taylor & vermeulen ( 1997 ) , some of which are contemporaneous with the 8.4 and 15 ghz observations reported here . parallactic angle effects resulting from the altitude - azimuth antenna mounts were removed using the aips task clcor . amplitude calibration for each antenna was derived from measurements of antenna gain and system temperatures during each run . delays between the stations clocks were determined using the aips task fring ( schwab & cotton 1983 ) . calibration was applied by splitting the multi - source data set immediately prior to preliminary editing , imaging , deconvolution and self - calibration in difmap ( shepherd , pearson , & taylor 1994 , 1995 ) . multiple iterations of phase self - calibration and imaging were applied to each source before any attempt at amplitude self - calibration was made . the preliminary models developed in difmap were subsequently applied in aips to make phase corrections , to determine the leakage terms between the rcp and lcp feeds and to correct for residual phase differences between polarizations . final imaging and self - calibration were performed in difmap . model fitting of gaussian components to the self - calibrated visibility data was also performed in difmap . the shapes of the components were fixed after fitting to the 1995 epoch ; in the rest of the epochs each component was allowed only to move and to vary in flux density in order to fit the independently self - calibrated visibility data . each frequency band ( 5 , 8.4 and 15.4 ghz ) was modelfit independently in order to allow for differences in component shapes between frequencies . for our last three epochs from 2003 to 2008 , all global 8.4 ghz observations , an additional pair of components had to be fit on either side of the core ( see 4.1 ) . uncertainties in the sizes and positions for components were derived from signal - to - noise ratios and component sizes ( fomalont 1999 ) . this assumes that parameters are not covariant , which should be the case for the strong , well - separated components that we present in this analysis of 1946 + 708 . while one of the first objects to be confirmed as a bona - fide compact symmetric object , 1946 + 708 is in a few ways unusual for this class . the source is remarkably `` rotation '' symmetric ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . narrow , well collimated jets emerge from a compact , flat spectrum core and bend gradually before terminating in well defined hot spots . faint `` lobes '' of emission are evident at 90 angles to the jets . distinct components in the jet are seen to move out from the core to the hot spots on both the northern ( jet ) side and the southern ( counter - jet ) side . our most uniform , sensitive , and highest resolution sequence of images is that at 8.4 ghz . the 8.4 ghz images cover the period from march 1995 to march 2008 , and have noise levels ranging from 163 jy / beam down to 38 jy / beam ( table 1 ) . no polarized flux has been detected from 1946 + 708 at either 8.4 or 15.4 ghz in any epoch . typical 2 limits on the linearly polarized flux density are jy at 8.4 ghz and jy at 15.4 ghz . this source is quite steady in the production of strong and distinct jet components . in addition to the previously studied pairs n2/s2 and n5/s5 , we report here on the discovery of a new set of components which we name n6/s6 ( fig . 2 ) . like the previous sets , these new components appear to have been launched simultaneously as a pair , and appear to be moving away from the core in opposite directions . the angular separation between the new pair ( n6 and s6 ) observed in our 2008 epoch is 1.288 mas . the apparent proper motion between n6 and s6 and the core is difficult to determine owing to possible blending of these components with the core , but the total separation can be compared with the 2006 epoch in which it was 1.045 mas . the total apparent expansion speed between the pair over the past two years is thus 0.238 mas / y or 0.72 c. this puts the ejection age for the new pair at 1997.3 . indeed evidence of the new component set can be seen in the 2003 epoch , and to a lesser extent in 2001 . the sum of the core flux density and the flux density of the new components n6 and s6 during this period ( fig . 3 ) was rising steadily , and only seems to be declining later on , as the new components move well away from the core . in fig . 4 we plot the positions of the 4 strongest jet components ( n2 , n5 , s5 and s2 ) derived from modelfitting elliptical gaussians to the visibility data at 8.4 ghz . the well - tracked jet components close to the core , n5 and s5 , appear to move out with the highest apparent velocity ( table 2 and fig . 5 ; and see also the moviegbtaylor/ ] ) , with n5 being the fastest at an apparent velocity of 1.088 c , and s5 being about one third that in very nearly the opposite direction . note that these are apparent velocities projected in the plane of the sky , as opposed to intrinsic , three - dimensional velocities . the more distant pair of components ( n2/s2 ) appear to be moving at roughly half the apparent velocity of the inner ( n5/s5 ) pair . from this fact one might be tempted to assert that the jet starts out fast and decelerates with time . if this was the case , and the deceleration is uniform , then we would expect to see the n5/s5 pair slowing down , but this is not observed . even after 12 years of monitoring and a distance covered corresponding to 10% of the length of the jet , there is no compelling evidence for slowing of any of the components . the values indicate reasonably good fits to a straight line for all components ( the values may be systematically better in declination than in right ascension owing to the north - south orientation of most of the components ) . if current velocities remain unchanged then the n5/s5 pair will catch up with the n2/s2 pair in years , close to the time that they enter the hot spots . alternatively , it could be that there is a sudden deceleration of the jet components at a distance from the core between 3.5 and 9 mas ( on the northern side ) . this gap is defined by the minimum distance of 9 mas for n2 in 1995 and the maximum distance for n5 observed in 2008 . this is in the region where the jet bends the most  towards the northern hot spot , so a deceleration region should not be ruled out prematurely . considering the newest pair of components , n6/s6 , their total apparent separation speed is 0.72c , more like that of the n2/s2 pair ( 0.63 c ) , than the n5/s5 pair ( 1.4 c ) . observations over the next years should settle the issue of whether components emerge with their own , intrinsic set of velocities , or if they partake in some fixed pattern of acceleration and deceleration . if there is a fixed , repeating pattern , then it might be possible to relate it to a helical jet model . in a helical model , the intrinsic velocity could be constant while the orientation changes in time to produce the observed variations in the projected apparent velocities . such a model naturally reproduces the rotational symmetry of 1946 + 708 and has been found to explain observations over many years of the galactic jet in ss433 ( roberts et al . 2008 , hjellming & johnston 1981 ) . the path of the inner jet components of 1946 + 708 ( n5 and s5 ) both appear fairly straight to within the errors in the measurements . there is a suggestion of a bend in the trajectory of n5 after the 2006 epoch ( epoch 9 in fig . 4 ) , but this relies almost entirely on the position at the 2008 epoch . for the more distant northern component ( n2 ) there are kinks in the apparent motion near epochs 1994 , 2001 and 2006 ( epochs 2 , 7 and 9 in fig . 4 ) . there also appears to be an offset in the 15 ghz positions ( see fig . this suggests a flatter spectrum on the eastern side of this component . a similar offset is suggested by the multi - frequency trajectory plot of s2 based on the 5 and 8 ghz observations , but since the motions are smaller and the component is weaker it is difficult to be sure if the spectral gradient is real . a kink is observed in component s2 near the 2003 epoch ( epoch 8 in fig . 4 ) . in well studied core - jet sources , such as 3c345 ( zensus et al . 1995 , unwin et al . 1997 ) , jet components are found to travel along curved trajectories and to change their speeds . this acceleration has been taken as justification for magnetically driven jets , as opposed to purely hydrodynamical structures ( vlakhis & konigl 2004 ) . by analogy with these core - jet sources , we draw a similar conclusion that the jets of 1946 + 708 are likely to be magnetically driven . note , however , that intrinsic velocities of jet components in core - jet agns are typically in the range , considerably larger than we observe in the cso 1946 + 708 of 1.3 2.3 ( see below ) . even before the core of 1946 + 708 was identified based on 15 ghz observations , the first two epochs at 5 ghz suggested its location by exhibiting bi - directional motions away from the center of the source . given these motions and the symmetry of the source ( figs . 1 and 2 ) , it is reasonable to assert that n5 and s5 were ejected at the same time , and likewise n2 and s2 . indeed , we are fortunate enough to witness the ejection of n6 and s6 in as discussed above . sensitive observations at 8.4 ghz ( see fig . 2 ) , reveal that there is continuous emission from the core out to both hot spots . the jet is probably not made up of discrete blobs that can be well described by the elliptical gaussian components that we identify and modelfit . rather the jet appears to be a continuous flow , with features of enhanced emission ( shocks ? ) that propagate down the jet . under the assumption that components are ejected in pairs , and that all differences are due to doppler boosting and light travel time effects , we can use the observed apparent velocity ratios and differences to solve for the intrinsic component velocity and orientation . for simultaneously ejected components moving in opposite directions at an angle to the line of sight at an intrinsic velocity , it follows directly from the light travel time difference that the ratio of apparent projected distances from the origin ( for the approaching side , for the receding side ) as well as the ratio of apparent motions ( approaching : , receding : ) is given at any time by ( taylor & vermeulen 1997 ) : our other important constraint on the two parameters and can be obtained from the separation rate , is not subject to the uncertainty in the reference point . from geometry and the conversion of angular to linear velocity we have : where is the projected separation velocity , is the angular size distance to the source , and is the redshift . note that eq . 2 has a distance dependence , while eq . 1 does not , so we can solve the system jointly for the distance and hence the hubble constant . for the n5/s5 pair we find an apparent velocity ratio of 3.50 0.44 . this leads to = 0.56 0.04 . at the same time , the apparent separation speed of the n5/s5 pair is 1.40 0.01 c. the two relations above are shown graphically in fig . 6 ( bottom panel ) . assuming a standard cosmology and h = 71 km s mpc we find a common solution for an intrinsic velocity of 0.88 0.03 c , at an inclination of 50 5 . a similar analysis for the n2/s2 pair ( top panel of fig . 6 ) , yields in intrinsic velocity of 0.57 0.11 c and with an inclination of 36 10 . the intrinsic velocity therefore changes from 0.9 c for n5/s5 to 0.6 c for n2/s2 ( a change of 2.7 ) . there is no single intrinsic velocity that can fit the observations for both pairs , and can be used to directly measure the hubble constant . we can , however , place a lower limit on the hubble constant based on the fact that the intrinsic velocity must be less than the speed of light . we find that h 57 km s mpc in order to achieve a valid solution for the n5/s5 pair , and the weaker constraint that h 28 km s mpc in order to achieve a valid solution for the n2/s2 pair . since the velocities of n2/s2 differ from those of n5/s5 anyway , we see no reason why the latter should be particularly close to c , so for the rest of this discussion we adopt h = 71 km s mpc . the solutions discussed above using equations 1 and 2 are based on assuming that the components in a pair , as observed , are oppositely directed and equally fast . we derive angles near 45 ; the line of sight depth difference between the components in a pair would therefore be an appreciable fraction of their total distance along the connecting line through the core , and roughly equal to the distance projected onto the plane of the sky . we derive component speeds that are an appreciable fraction of the speed of light . in combination , the speed and angle solutions imply that the receding component , due to a significant light travel time difference , should be observed at a rather younger age ( 25%-75% ) than its approaching counterpart , and at a correspondingly smaller projected distance from the core . however , the observed arm length ratios  are lower by a factor of about 2 compared to the apparent velocity ratios ( 1.33 vs. 2.76 for n2/s2 ; and 1.80 vs.3.50 for n5/s5 ) . this requires that currently the light travel time differences between the approaching and receding components are less significant with respect to the ages of the components than our simple speed and angle solutions suggest . the arm length ratios depend on the entire history of motion of the components , and the greater degree of symmetry in arm lengths seems to imply that for a significant part of their lifetime the components were slower and/or moving more along the plane of the sky than they are now . a fully self - consistent solution therefore will incorporate a model for the true core location and for this evolution in velocity , since , inevitably , it implies that the receding component is seen at a younger age and therefore with a different velocity than its counterpart . this leads to an extension of equations 1 and 2 , into a set where the arm length ratio is directly incorporated ; helical jet models may provide a framework for this extension . however , it is beyond the scope of this paper . to properly verify such a model in the case of 1946 + 708 will require observations spanning several decades . nevertheless , we believe the velocities we have derived , while not fully self - consistent , are indicative of the fact that the jets of this source contain features that move with speeds that are an appreciable fraction of the speed of light , and certainly much faster than the advance speeds of the hot spots . furthermore , the differences in angle ( by at least 15 degrees ) as well as in speed ( by at least 50% ) between the n2/s2 and n5/s5 pairs are good indications of the kinds of changes in component velocity that are evidently occurring in and along the jets . both the discrepant arm length ratios and the observed bending in projection of the overall jets on the plane of the sky provide interesting constraints . the time evolution of the flux densities of the n2/s2 and n5/s5 pair is shown in fig . the n2 component has shown a steady rise by % over 13 years of monitoring at 8.4 ghz . during that same time s2 has only slightly decreased . meanwhile both n5 and s5 have been declining though that appears to have leveled off starting in 2006 . the amount of the decline was 75% for n5 and 57% for s5 . we are currently in the unbalanced situation where s5 appears to be brighter than n5 , which would at first sight seem contrary to the expectations from doppler boosting . however , we have to keep in mind that the light from s5 is delayed compared to the light that we see from n5 ( by 27 years for the 2008 epoch according to the geometry derived above ) so that the history of variability must be taken into account when attempting to interpret flux density ratios between component pairs . a more detailed analysis of the flux density ratios , taking into account the time variability , should eventually be possible . even so , it may not be possible to explain the very significant changes in flux density shown in fig . 7 . given the stability of the component velocities ( see fig . 5 ) . local circumstances ( e.g. , variations in magnetic field strength or particle populations ) , and possible interactions of the jet components with their environments , may influence the synchrotron emissivity of the jet components . the curvature in the jets of 1946 + 708 ( fig . 1 ) could be explained by either ( 1 ) ballistic motion from a precessing nucleus ; or ( 2 ) helical confinement of the components . in the first case we would expect components to travel in straight lines at constant apparent velocities . in the latter case we would expect that components might travel along helical trajectories at apparent velocities that changed in time . although there is no strong evidence yet for deviations from constant apparent velocities , there do appear to be some wiggles or kinks in the jets , and in particular if one considers also the earliest 5 ghz measurement ( c1 in fig . 4 ) , then there appears to have been a change in direction of several degrees . this favors the second explanation of a helically confined jet . likewise , the presence of continuous emission along the jet , well confined , even if traveling at different intrinsic velocities ( n5 vs n2 ) , supports the notional model of an intrinsically helical jet . from the modelfit analysis it is difficult to ascertain the expansion of the source . certainly it is clear that the motion is much slower than the jet components . unfortunately the southern hot spot is fairly faint and diffuse , so is correspondingly less amenable to modelfitting than the compact jet components . the northern hot spot does have a bright and compact feature , and one can measure with considerable accuracy its position relative to the core . the observed motion is .01 mas / y , at the level that one has to be concerned about possible motions of the core component due to the ejection of the n6/s6 pair . since the modelfit results are referenced to the core component , any apparent proper motion of the core translates into the addition of a systematic apparent velocity to all components . an alternative approach is to compute a difference map between two images , well separated in time . apparent motions then show up as alternating positive and negative structures . 8 shows such an image constructed by differencing the images from the 1996 and 2008 epochs - both of which are of very high quality and low noise , and were convolved with the same restoring beam . lighter regions in fig . 8 indicate where the source was brighter in 2008 . in fig . 8 one can see a relatively clear signature of motion away from the core of the southern hot spot , which appears as a positive ( dark ) structure ( closer to the core ) and a negative ( whiter ) structure ( further from the core ) in the difference image . the more rapidly moving jet components show similar structures . from measuring the advance of the edge of the southern hot spot we estimate this apparent motion to be 0.008 0.002 mas / y . since the apparent motion measured is relative to the northern hot spot , this is the overall apparent expansion rate of the source , and the apparent motion of the southern hot spot would presumably be half this value , or 0.004 mas / y , corresponding to a projected intrinsic velocity of 0.024 c ( 7000 km / s ) . based on the measurement of the overall expansion rate , we can derive a kinematic age for 1946 + 708 assuming a constant expansion rate . the velocity measurement derived above yields a kinematic age of 4000 1000 years . this is on the long end of cso ages measured to date ( gugliucci et al . 2005 ) , which have been measured between 100 and 3000 years , though the statistics are admittedly still poor . furthermore , there is a selection effect that slow expansions take longer to measure . the ratio of 15:1 for the northern to southern hot spot flux densities ( derived from modelfitting ) , is difficult to explain in terms of doppler boosting given the very low apparent velocities measured for the hot spots . a more likely explanation is that the interstellar medium may be enhanced on the northern side , consistent with the observation of greater hi opacity to the north ( peck & taylor 2001 ) . the arm length ratio between northern and southern hot spots is close to parity , 0.94:1 , with the northern hot spot being a little closer to the core . in the case of doppler boosting we would expect the northern hot spot to be further away from the core , thus we favor a denser medium on the northern side to be responsible for the difference in flux densities and arm length ratios between the two hot spots . the low observed polarization ( less than 0.4% for the core , less than .3% for the jet components , and less than 0.1% for the northern hot spot at 8.4 ghz in 1996 ) , can be explained by faraday depolarization due to ionized gas and a magnetic field tangled on scales smaller than the angular resolution of the observations . this situation could naturally arise due to magnetic fields and free electrons associated with the accretion disk . detection of polarization has only been found in a few csos to date ( gugliucci et al . those few incidents of detected polarization occur in the approaching jets of csos which are more asymmetric and core - dominated than typical csos , probably indicating a smaller angle to the line - of - sight , and therefore a more shallow faraday screen . after a detailed , multi - frequency , multi - epoch study of the compact symmetric object 1946 + 708 , we find the kinematic age of the extant radio emission to be years . on timescales of years , outbursts occur producing symmetric components that emerge from the core and travel at intrinsic speeds between 0.6 and 0.9 c towards the hot spots . some of the individual jet components are observed to move along slightly bent , or kinked paths , but no components have yet been observed to change their speed . the jet components in general appear to be well confined , and to lie within the overall `` s - symmetric '' shape of the jets . we suggest that the jets are helically confined , rather than ballistic in nature . no linear polarization from the jets or hot - spots is detected down to quite low levels ( 0.1 to 0.4% ) , consistent with observations of csos in general . future observations over the next decade should allow for a detailed analysis of the newly ejected component pair n6/s6 . together with continued observations of n2/s2 and n5/s5 it should be possible to measure accelerations in the jet components , and to tell if each component pair has an intrinsic velocity that is established upon ejection . a more sophisticated analysis , taking into account the flux history of the jet components , could provide a more stringent test of doppler boosting in 1946 + 708 and thereby ascertain the extent to which interactions with the environment are important . we thank h. smith for help with the data reduction of the 1998 and 1999 epochs . taylor gratefully acknowledges the university of bordeaux for hosting a visit during which much of this work was undertaken . this work has benefited from research funding from the european community s sixth framework programme under radionet r113ct 2003 5058187 . the national radio astronomy observatory is operated by associated universities , inc . , under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation . the european vlbi network is a joint facility of european , chinese , south african and other radio astronomy institutes funded by their national research councils . gugliucci , n.e . , taylor , g.b . , peck , a.b . , & giroletti , m. 2005 apj , 622 , 136 gugliucci , n.e . , taylor , g.b . , peck , a.b . , & giroletti , m. 2007 apj , 661 , 78 hjellming , r. m. , & johnston , k. j. 1981 , , 246 , l141 fomalont , e. b. 1999 , synthesis imaging in radio astronomy ii , 180 , 301 owsianik , i. & conway , j. e. 1998 , a&a , 337 , 69 peck , a. b. , taylor , g. b. , fassnacht , c. .d . , readhead , a. c. s. , & vermeulen , r. c. 2000 , apj , 534 , 104 peck , a.b . , & taylor , g.b . 2001 , apjl , 554 , l147 pihlstrm , y. m. , conway , j. e. , & vermeulen , r. c. 2003 , a&a , 404 , 871 readhead , a. c. s. , taylor , g. b. , xu , w. , pearson , t. j. , wilkinson , p. n. , & polatidis , a. g. 1996 , apj , 460 , 612 roberts , d. h. , wardle , j. f. c. , lipnick , s. l. , selesnick , p. l. , & slutsky , s. 2008 , , 676 , 584 schwab , f. r. , & cotton , w. d. 1983 , aj , 88 , 688 shepherd , m. c. , pearson , t. j. , & taylor , g. b. 1994 , baas , 26 , 987 shepherd , m. c. , pearson , t. j. , & taylor , g. b. 1995 , baas , 27 , 903 taylor , g. b. , vermeulen , r. c. , pearson , t. j. , readhead , a. c. s. , henstock , d. r. , browne , i. w. a. , & wilkinson , p. n. 1994 , apjs , 95 , 345 taylor , g. b. , readhead , a. c. s. , & pearson , t. j. 1996 , apj , 463 , 95 taylor , g. b. , & vermeulen , r. c. 1997 , apjl , 485 , l9 taylor , g. b. , marr , j. m. , readhead , a. c. s. , & pearson , t. j. 2000 , apj , 541 , 112 unwin , s. c. wehrle , a. e. , lobanov , a. p. , zensus , j. a. , madejski , g. m. , aller , m. f. , & aller , h. d. 1997 , apj , 480 , 596 vlahakis , n. & konigl , a. 2004 , apj , 605 , 656 zensus , j. a. , cohen , m. h. , & unwin , s. c. 1995 , apj , 443 , 35 -12pt 2003 feb 2 is the mean epoch for observations taken with the vlba alone on january 24 , 2003 and with a global array consisting of the vlba , westerbork phased array , onsala , medicina and noto on 2003 february 10 . the observations were combined for calibration and imaging . lccccccc core & reference component & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... + n2 & 0.076 0.0008 & 0.90 & .014 0.0002 & 3.0 & 0.077 0.0008 & 0.461 0.005 & 10.4 + s2 & .026 0.0008 & 0.80 & 0.011 0.0004 & 3.0 & 0.028 0.0009 & 0.167 0.005 & .1 + n5 & 0.126 0.0013 & 1.4 & .132 0.0014 & 2.3 & 0.182 0.0019 & 1.088 0.011 & 46.3 + s5 & .031 0.0008 & 0.53 & 0.042 0.0007 & 2.1 & 0.052 0.001 & 0.311 0.006 & .4 + -5pt", "summary": "we report on a multi -

\\ar@<-1ex> {s } & { x 3 } \\ar@<1ex>^{t } \\ar@<-1ex> {s } & { ... } \\ar@<1ex>^{t } \\ar@<-1ex> {s } & { x n } \\ar@<1ex>^{t } \\ar@<-1ex> {s}}\\ ] ] satisfying the equations and , which embody the the objects ( elements of ) , arrows ( elements of ) and higher cells of the structure in question . at this stage no compositions have been defined , and when they are , one has a globular set with extra structure . in this way the problem of defining an n - categorical structure of a given type is that of defining the monad on the category of -globular sets whose algebras are these structures . as explained in the introduction to , this approach works because the monads concerned have excellent formal properties , which facilitate their explicit description and further analysis . the -operads of can be defined from the point of view of monads : one has the monad on whose algebras are strict -categories , and an -operad consists of another monad on equipped with a cartesian monad morphism . the algebras of this -operad are just the algebras of . strict -categories are easily defined by iterated enrichment : a strict -category is a category enriched in the category of strict -categories via its cartesian product , but are too strict for the intended applications in homotopy theory and geometry . for the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak -category with and not lose vital information is a gray category , which is a category enriched in using the gray tensor product of 2-categories instead of its cartesian product . this experience leads naturally to the idea of trying to define what the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product are , so as to set up a similar inductive definition as for strict -categories , but to capture the appropriate semi - strict -categories , which in the appropriate sense , would form the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak -category with and not lose vital information . crans in attempted to realise this idea in dimension 4 , and one of our main motivations is to obtain a theory that will deliver the sort of tensor product that crans was trying to define explicitly , but in a conceptual way that one could hope to generalise to still higher dimensions . our examples and  embody the progress that we have achieved in this direction in this paper . in the theory of the present paper is used to show that the funny tensor product of categories which is what one obtains by considering the gray tensor product of -categories but ignoring what happens to 2-cells generalises to give an analogous symmetric monoidal closed structure on the category of algebras of any higher operad . from these developments it seems that a conceptual understanding of the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product is within reach . fundamentally , we have two kinds of combinatorial objects important for the description and study of higher categorical structures -operads and tensor products . in a description of the relationship between tensor products and -operads was begun , and -operads whose algebras involve no structure at the level objects were canonically related with certain lax tensor products on . under this correspondence the algebras of the -operad coincide with categories enriched in the associated lax tensor product . sections- of the present paper continue this development by studying , for a given category , the passage where is the category of graphs enriched in , in a systematic way . this analysis culminates in section where the above assignment is seen as the object part of a 2-functor where is a sub 2-category of the 2-category of lax monoidal categories , and is as defined by the formal theory of monads . from this perspective , one is able to describe in a more efficient and general way , many of the previous developments of higher category theory in the globular style . for instance , in section we give a short and direct explicit construction of the monads for strict -categories from which all their key properties are easily witnessed . in sections and  we give shorter and more general proofs of some of the main results of . in section using a dual version of our 2-functor and the formal theory of monads , we obtain a satisfying general explanation for how it is that monad distributive laws arise in higher category theory see . in sections and  we apply our theory to simplifying many aspects of . the correspondence between -operads and certain lax monoidal structures on given in , associates to the 3-operad for gray categories , a lax tensor product on the category of 2-globular sets . however the gray tensor product itself is a tensor product of 2-categories . any lax monoidal structure on a category comes with a `` unary '' tensor product , which rather than being trivial as is the usual experience with non - lax tensor products , is in fact a monad on . for the lax tensor product induced by , this is the monad for 2-categories . in section we solve the general problem of lifting a lax monoidal structure , to a tensor product on the category of algebras of the monad defined by its unary part . this result , theorem , is the main result of the paper , and provides also the sense in which these lifted tensor products are unique . in practical terms this means that in order to exhibit a given tensor product on some category of higher dimensional structures as arising from our machinery , it suffices to exhibit an operad whose algebras are categories enriched in that tensor product . in this way , one is able see that the usual gray tensor product and that of crans , do so arise . moreover applying this lifting to the lax tensor products on associated to general -operads ( over ) , one exhibits the structures definable by -operads as enriched categories whose homs are some -dimensional structure . in this way the globular approach is more closely related to some of the inductive approaches to higher category theory , such as that of tamsamani . in section we describe two applications of the lifting theorem . in theorem we construct a tensor product of -algebras . as explained in the problem of providing such a tensor product is of relevance to string theory , and it proved resistant because of the negative result which shows that no `` genuine '' tensor product can exist . however this result does not rule out the existence of a lax tensor product , which is what we were able to provide in theorem . it is possible to see the identification by joyal and street , of braided monoidal categories as monoidal categories with a multiplication as an instance of theorem . another instance is our second application given in corollary , namely an analogous result to that of joyal and street but for braided monoidal 2-categories . a weak -category is an algebra of a contractible -operad . in section we recall this notion , give an analogous notion of contractible lax monoidal structure and explain the canonical relationship between them . in this paper we operate at a more abstract level than in much of the previous work on this subject . in particular , instead of studying monads on the category of -globular sets , or even on presheaf categories , we work with monads defined on some category of enriched graphs . as our work shows , the main results and notions of higher category theory in the globular style can be given in this setting . so one could from the very beginning start not with as the category of -categories , but with a nice enough . for all the constructions to go through , such as that of , the correspondence between monads and lax tensor products , their lifting theorem , as well as the very definition of weak -category , it suffices to take to be a locally c - presentable category in the sense defined in section . proceeding this way one obtains then the theory of -dimensional structures enriched in . that is to say , the object of -cells between any two -cells of such a structure would be an object of rather than a mere set . some alternative choices of which could perhaps be of interest are : ( 1 ) the ordinal =\\{0<1\\} ] is equivalent to the full subcategory of ] described in the statement of the lemma . we shall describe the functors \\rightarrow \\ca f } & & { ( -)^{- } : \\ca f \\rightarrow \\ca g } \\ ] ] which provide the desired equivalence directly . given ] are computed componentwise from colimits in and so for we must describe a universal cocone with components we demand that the are identities on objects . this is possible since the form the constant diagram on by the hypotheses on . for we choose an arbitrary colimit cocone in . one may easily verify directly that since is connected , the do indeed define a univeral cocone for all in order to establish ( 1 ) . since the properties of path - likeness and distributivity involve only colimits at the level of the homs as does the construction of just given , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) follow immediately since colimits commute with colimits in general . with these preliminaries in hand we are now ready to present the monad version of the multitensor lifting theorem , and then the lifting theorem itself . let be a locally presentable category , be a coproduct preserving monad on , be an accessible and normalised monad on , and be a monad morphism whose components are identities on objects . denote by the monad induced by . * one may choose so that becomes normalised . given such a choice of : * if is path - like then is path - like . * if is distributive then is distributive . let be the regular cardinal such that preserves -filtered colimits . to verify that is a normalised monad one must verify : ( i ) is normalised , and ( ii ) the components of the unit are identities on objects . since is a retraction of , it will then follow that the components of are also identities on objects . but is normalised iff is normalised , and , so for ( i ) it suffices to show that one can choose making normalised . this follows by a transfinite induction using the explicit description of of section and lemma . for the initial step note that can be chosen to be normalised , because is a componentwise - identity on objects natural transformation between normalised functors , since the monads and are normalised . thus the coequaliser defining is a connected colimit involving only normalised functors and componentwise - identity on objects natural transformations , and so can be taken to be normalised by lemma . for the inductive steps the argument is basically the same : at each stage one is taking connected colimits of normalised functors and componentwise identity on objects natural transformations , so that by lemma one stays within the subcategory of $ ] consisting of such functors and natural transformations . moreover using lemma will be path - like if is . as for ( ii ) it suffices to prove that the components of are identities on objects . writing for transfinite composite constructed as part of the definition of ( note that by definition ) recall from the end of section that one has a commutative square ^ -{\\ca g\\rho } \\ar {{\\phi}u^m } & { u^{\\ca gr } } \\ar^{\\ca g(u^r)\\eta^t } \\\\ { su^{\\ca gr } } \\ar -{q } & { u^s\\phi {!}}}\\ ] ] where is the 2-cell datum for s eilenberg - moore object , which we recall is preserved by . now is componentwise the identity objects since is and is a retraction of it , is the identity on objects by definition , and is by construction , so the result follows . recall from definition that a lift of is a normal multitensor on together with an isomorphism which commutes with the forgetful functors into . when in addition is distributive , we say that it is a distributive lift of . recall from that for any category , the functor which sends a monad on to the forgetful functor , is fully - faithful . let be a distributive multitensor on a locally presentable category , and let be accessible in each variable . then has a distributive lift , which is unique up to isomorphism . write for the distributive multitensor on whose unary part is and whose non - unary parts are constant at . there is an obvious inclusion of multitensors and one clearly has applying lemma with , and one produces a path - like , normalised and distributive monad on , because is accessible by proposition . thus one has a distributive multitensor on . applying proposition to , and corollary to , gives in view of the monadicity of . that is to say , is a distributive lift of . as for uniqueness suppose that is a distributive lift of . then by corollary and proposition , is a distributive monad on and one has commuting with the forgetful functors into . by the fully - faithfulness of recalled above , one has an isomorphism of monads , and thus by proposition an isomorphism of multitensors . applying this result to any normalised -operad , exhibits its algebras as categories enriched in the algebras of some -operad . the -operad is , and tensor product over which one enriches is . in cases where we already know what our tensor product ought to be , the uniqueness part of theorem ensures that it is . an instance of this is in the normalised 3-operad whose algebras are gray categories was constructed . as we have already seen , is a lax monoidal structure on whose enriched categories are gray categories , and is the operad for strict 2-categories . note that the usual gray tensor product is symmetric monoidal closed and thus distributive . thus by theorem is the gray tensor product . in other words , the general methods of this paper have succeeded in producing the gray tensor product of -categories from the operad . more generally given a distributive tensor product on the category of algebras of an -operad , and a normalised -operad whose algebras are the categories enriched in -algebras , theorem exhibits as the more generally constructed . in sjoerd crans explicitly constructed a tensor product on the category of gray - categories . this explicit construction was extremely complicated . it is possible to exhibit the crans tensor product as an instance of our general theory , by rewriting his explicit constructions as the construction of the 4-operad whose algebras are teisi in his sense . the multitensor associated to this 4-operad has equal to the 3-operad for gray categories . thus theorem constructs a lax tensor product of gray categories whose enriched categories are teisi . since the tensor product explicitly constructed by crans is distributive , the uniqueness of part of theorem ensures that it is indeed , since teisi are categories enriched in the crans tensor product by definition . honestly writing the details of the 4-operad of example is a formidable task and we have omitted this here . in the end though , such details will not be important , because such a tensor product ( or more properly a biclosed version thereof ) will only be really useful once it is given a conceptual definition . let be a symmetric monoidal model category which satisfies the conditions of or the monoid axiom of . in this case the category of pruned -operads of can be equipped with a monoidal model structure . so we can speak of cofibrant -operads in . for let us fix a particular cofibrant and contractible -operad . the algebras of can be called -categories enriched in . up to homotopy the choice of is not important . so we can speak of the category of -categories . for we denote by a cofibrant contractible -operad in . let be the corresponding multitensor on . one can always choose in such a way that its unary part is . as in for an arbitary multitensor , one object -categories are called -monoids . similarly one object -categories are called -monoids . 1 . there is a distributive lift of to the category of -categories . 2 . restricts to give a multitensor on the category of -monoids . the category of -monoids is equivalent to the category of algebras of and therefore is quillen equivalent to the category of the algebras of the little squares operad . the first statement is a direct consequence of theorem . the second statement follows from the fact that is the cartesian product on the object level . the last statement follows from the theorem(8.6 ) of . applying this result to the case with its folklore model structure one recovers the category of braided monoidal categories is equivalent to the category of monoidal categories equipped with multiplication . the previous corollary is proved by joyal and street by a direct application of a `` categorified '' eckmann - hilton argument . the following analogous result for -categories appears to be new . the category of braided monoidal -categories is equivalent to the category of gray - monoids with multiplication . apply theorem with equipped with the gray tensor product and lack s folklore model structure for 2-categories . thus theorem should be considered as an -generalisation of the above corollaries . we believe it sheds some light on the problem of defining the tensor product of -algebras initiated by . as explained in the introduction , the negative result of shows that there is no hope to get an `` honest '' tensor product of such algebras . thus the multitensor constructed in theorem is genuinely lax , and exhibits laxity as a way around the aforementioned negative result . in future work we will generalise this theorem to arbitrary dimensions . let us now instantiate the constructions of section to produce a more explicit description of the lifted multitensor . beyond mere instantiation this task amounts to reformulating everything in terms of hom maps which live in , because in our case the colimits being formed in at each stage of the construction are connected colimits diagrams whose morphisms are all identity on objects . moreover these fixed object sets are of the form for . + + * notation*. we shall be manipulating sequences of data and so we describe here some notation that will be convenient . a sequence from some set will be denoted more tersely as leaving the length unmentioned . similarly a sequence of sequences of elements from some set will be denoted the variable ranges over and the variable ranges over . triply - nested sequences look like this , and so on . these conventions are more or less implicit already in the notation we have been using all along for multitensors . see especially section and . we denote by the ordinary sequence obtained from the -tuply nested sequence by concatenation . in particular given a sequence , the set of such that is just the set of partitions of the original sequence into doubly - nested sequences , and will play an important role below . this is because to give the substitution maps for a multitensor on , is to give maps for all and from such that . + + the monad map is taken as where is the inclusion of the unary part of the multitensor . note the notational abuse we regard write for the multitensor on obtained from by ignoring ( ie setting to constant at ) the non - unary parts , but also as the monad on and so as monads . the role of in is played by sequences of -algebras regarded as objects of as in section . the transfinite induction produces for each ordinal and each sequence of -algebras as above of length , morphisms in which are identities on objects , and thus we shall now evolve this notation so that it only records what s going on in the hom between and . by the definition of we have the equation on the left and the equation on the right is a definition . because of these definitions and that of we have the equation the data for the hom maps of the thus consists of morphisms in whenever one has as sequences of -algebras . to summarise , the output of the transfinite process we are going to describe is , for each ordinal , the following data . for each sequence of -algebras , one has an object and morphisms of where . + + * initial step*. first we put , , and then form the coequaliser { \\ope\\limits ix i}=\"m \" { \\opeone\\limits i(x i , x i)}=\"r \" \" l\":@<2ex>\"m\"^-{\\sigma } \" l\":\"m\" -{\\ope\\limits ix i}:@<1ex>\"r\"^-{q^{(0)} {(x i , x i)}}}\\ ] ] in to define . put and

in which is part of the first step of the explicit inductive construction of . we shall refer to  as the basic coequaliser associated to the sequence of -algebras . note that all coequalisers under discussion here are reflexive coequalisers , with the common section for the basic coequalisers given by the maps . the basic result which expresses why reflexive coequalisers are nice , is the -lemma , which we record here for the reader s convenience . a proof can be found in . * -lemma*. given a diagram ^ -{f 1 } \\ar@<-1ex> {g 1 } \\ar@<1ex>^{b 1 } \\ar@<-1ex> {a 1 } & b \\ar^-{h 1 }

1 ) the two top rows and the right - most column are coequalisers , ( 2 ) and have a common section , ( 3 ) and have a common section , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ; then is a coequaliser of and . if is a functor which preserves connected colimits of a certain type , then it also preserves these colimits in each variable separately , because for a connected colimit , a cocone involving only identity arrows is a universal cocone . the most basic corollary of the -lemma says that the converse of this is true for reflexive coequalisers . let be a functor . if preserves reflexive coequalisers in each variable separately then preserves reflexive coequalisers . and this can be proved by induction on using the -lemma in much the same way as lemma(1 ) . the most well - known instance of this is let be a biclosed monoidal category . then the -fold tensor product of reflexive coequalisers in is again a reflexive coequaliser . in particular note that by corollary a multitensor preserves ( some class of ) reflexive coequalisers iff it preserves them in each variable separately . returning to our basic coequalisers an immediate consequence of the explicit description of and corollary is let be a distributive multitensor on a cocomplete category , and a sequence of -algebras . if preserves the basic coequalisers associated to all the subsequences of , then for all , preserves the coequaliser  . and applying this lemma and corollary gives let be a locally presentable category , a regular cardinal , a distributive -accessible multitensor on and a sequence of -algebras . if preserves the basic coequalisers associated to all the subsequences of , then one may take where the action is defined as the unique map such that . note in particular that when the sequence of -algebras is of length or , the associated basic coequaliser is absolute . in the case the basic coequaliser is constant at , and when the basic coequaliser may be taken to be the canonical presentation of the given -algebra . thus in these cases it follows from corollary that and . reformulating the explicit description of the unit in corollary one recovers the fact from our explicit descriptions , that the unit of is the identity , which was of course true by construction . to complete the task of giving a completely explicit description of the multitensor we now turn to unpacking its substitution . so we assume that is a distributive -accessible multitensor on a locally presentable category , and fix an ordinal so that , so that may be constructed as as in corollary . by transfinite induction on we shall generate the following data : and whenever , such that { \\operpone\\limits {ij}\\opem\\limits k}=\"tr \" { \\opem\\limits {ijk}}=\"br \" { \\ope\\limits i\\opem\\limits {jk}}=\"bl \" \" tl\":\"tr\"^-{v^{(r)}e^{(m)}}:\"br\"^-{\\sigma^{(r{+}1)}}:@{<-}\"bl\"^-{(q^{(m)})^{-1}v^{(m)}}:@{<-}\"tl\"^-{\\ope\\limits i\\sigma^{(r)}}}\\ ] ] commutes . + + *

property of as a coequaliser . + + * limit step*. when is a limit ordinal define as induced by the for and the universal property of as the colimit of the sequence of the for . then define as the unique map such that using the universal property of as a coequaliser . + + the fact that the transfinite construction just specified was obtained from that for corollary , by taking and looking at the homs , means that by corollaries  and  one has let be a locally presentable category , a regular cardinal , a distributive -accessible multitensor on and a sequence of -algebras . then one has as an explicit description of the substitution of . if moreover preserves the basic coequalisers of all the subsequences of , then one may take as the explicit description of the substitution . recall that when has eilenberg - moore objects , the one and 2-cells of the 2-category admit another description . given monads and in , and writing and for the one - cell data of their respective eilenberg - moore objects , to give a monad functor , is to give and such that . this follows immediately from the universal property of eilenberg - moore objects . similarly to give a monad 2-cell is to give and commuting with and . note that eilenberg - moore objects in are computed as in , and we shall soon apply these observations to the case . suppose we have a lax monoidal functor , that and are locally presentable , and that and are accessible . then we obtain a commutative diagram { \\ca gv^{e 1}}=\"tm \" { \\ca gv}=\"tr \" { \\ca gw}=\"br \" { \\ca gw^{f 1}}=\"bm \" { \\enrich f}=\"bl \" \" tl\":\"tm\":\"tr \" \" bl\":\"bm\":\"br \" \" tl\":\"bl \" \" tm\":\"bm \" \" tr\":\"br\"}\\ ] ] of forgetful functors in . applying the previous paragraph to the left - most square gives a monad morphism , and then applying to this gives the lax monoidal functor between the induced lifted multitensors . arguing similarly for monoidal transformations and monad 2-cells , one finds that the assignment is 2-functorial . let be an -multitensor . in terms of the previous paragraph , this is the special case , , . the lifted multitensor corresponding to is just cartesian product for strict -categories . one has a component of for each sequence of strict -categories , and since as a right adjoint preserves products , this component may be regarded as a map of -algebras . if in particular is itself and , then these components of give a canonical comparison from the lifted tensor product of -categories to the cartesian product . for instance , when is the multitensor corresponding to the 3-operad for gray categories , then gives the well - known comparison map from the gray tensor product of 2-categories to the cartesian product , which we recall is actually a componentwise biequivalence . returning to the general situation , it is routine to unpack the assignment as in section and so obtain the following 1-cell counterpart of corollary . let be a lax monoidal functor such that and are locally presentable , and and are accessible . let be a sequence of objects of . then the component of at the sequence of free -algebras is just . let be a category and a class of maps in . denote by the class of maps in that have the right lifting property with respect to all the maps in . that is to say , is in iff for every in , and such that the outside of { x}=\"tr \" {

horizontal arrows are the coproduct injections are pullbacks , and so  follows by the pullback stability of trivial -fibrations . as for  note that for in , the connectedness of ensures that any

be functors and be a class of maps in . a natural transformation is a trivial -fibration when its components are trivial -fibrations . note that since trivial -fibrations in are pullback stable , this reduces , in the case where has a terminal object and is cartesian , to the map being a trivial -fibration . given a category with an initial object , and a class of maps in , we denote by the class of maps in containing the maps where . the proof of the following lemma is trivial . let be a category with an initial object and a class of maps in . then is a trivial -fibration iff it is surjective on objects and all its hom maps are trivial -fibrations . in particular starting with the category of globular sets and the empty class of maps , one generates a sequence of classes of maps of globular sets by induction on by the formula since may be identified with , and moreover one has inclusions . more explicitly , the set consists of maps : for one has the inclusion , where here denotes the representable globular set , that is the `` -globe '' , and is the -globe with its unique -cell removed . one defines to be the union of the s . note that by definition . there is another version of the induction just described to produce , for each , a class of maps of . the set consists of the functions so is the class of bijective functions . for , . as maps of globular sets , the class consists of all the maps of together with the unique map . let . an -operad is contractible when it is a trivial -fibration . an -multitensor is contractible when it is a trivial -fibration . by the preceeding two lemmas , an -operad over is contractible iff the hom maps of are trivial -fibrations . as one would expect an -operad over is contractible iff its associated -multitensor is contractible . this fact has quite a general explanation . recall the 2-functoriality of described in section and that of the lifting described in section . let be a lax monoidal functor between distributive lax monoidal categories , and a class of maps in . suppose that is extensive , preserves coproducts and the codomains of maps in are connected . then the following statements are equivalent * is a trivial -fibration . * is a trivial -fibration . and moreover when in addition and are locally presentable and and are accessible , these conditions are also equivalent to * the components of at sequences of free -algebras are trivial -fibrations . for each the component is the identity on objects and for , the corresponding hom map is obtained as the composite of and the canonical isomorphism that witnesses the fact that preserves coproducts . in particular note that for any sequence of objects of , regarded as -graph in the usual way , one has thus follows from lemmas and  . follows immediately from corollary . let , be an -operad over and be the corresponding -multitensor . tfsae : 1 . is contractible . is contractible . the components of of section are trivial -fibrations of -globular sets , when the are free strict -categories . by induction one may easily establish that the codomains of the maps in any of the classes : , , are connected so that proposition may be applied . applying this last result to the 3-operad for gray - categories , the contractibility of is a consequence of the fact that the canonical 2-functors from the gray to the cartesian tensor product are identity - on - object biequivalences . continuing the discussion from section , we now explain why the operads which describe trimble -categories \" are contractible . this result appears in as theorem(4.8 ) and exhibits trimble -categories as weak -categories in the batanin sense . let us denote by the set of inclusions of the -sphere into the disk for . as we remarked in section these may all be obtained by successively applying the reduced suspension functor to the inclusion of the empty space into the point . as we recalled in section , a basic ingredient of the trimble definition is a version of the little intervals operad which acts on the path spaces of any space . a key property of this operad is that it is contractible a topological operad being contractible when for each the unique map is in . this is equivalent to saying that the cartesian multitensor map is a trivial -fibration . a useful fact about the class trivial -fibrations is that it gets along with the construction of path - spaces in the sense of if is a trivial -fibration then so is for all . to give a commutative square as on the left in { x(a , b)}=\"tr \" { y(fa , fb)}=\"br \" { d^n}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\",:\"bl\":\"br \" ) } } } & & & { { s^n}=\"tl \" { ( a , x , b)}=\"tr \" { ( fa , y , fb)}=\"br \" { d^{n{+}1}}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\",:\"bl\":\"br \" ) } } } \\ ] ] is the same as giving a commutative square in as on the right in the previous display , by . the square on the right admits a diagonal filler since is a trivial -fibration , and thus so does the square on the left . we shall write for the forgetful functor for each . the relationship between trivial fibrations of spaces and of globular sets is expressed in if is a trivial -fibration then is a trivial -fibration . we proceed by induction on . having the right lifting property with respect to the inclusions ensures that surjective and injective on path components , and thus is inverted by . for the inductive step we assume that sends trivial -fibrations to trivial -fibrations and suppose that is a trivial -fibration . then so are all the maps it induces between path spaces by lemma . but from the inductive definition of recalled in section , we have and so is a morphism of -globular sets which is surjective on objects ( as argued already in the case ) and whose hom maps are trivial -fibrations by induction . thus the result follows by lemma . in section we exhibited as the algebras of an -operad by a straight - forward application of two abstract results propositions and  . we now provide a third such result relating to contractibility . given the data and hypotheses of proposition : is a lextensive category , a cartesian and coproduct preserving monad on , a -operad and a non - symmetric operad in . suppose furthermore that a class of maps of is given , and that the non - symmetric operad and the -operad are trivial fibrations . then the -operad of proposition is a trivial -fibration . by definition this monad morphism may be written as the composite . since is a trivial -fibration so is by lemma , and thus is a trivial -fibration by proposition . since is a trivial -fibration , is a trivial -fibration again by proposition , and so the result follows since trivial fibrations compose . starting with a contractible topological operad which acts on path spaces , proposition ensures that will be a contractible non - symmetric operad of -globular sets . then proposition may be applied to give , by induction on , the contractibility of the -operad defining trimble -categories . we would like to acknowledge clemens berger , richard garner , andr joyal , steve lack , joachim kock , jean - louis

section . an earlier reference for these matters is . however due to the technical nature of this material , and our need for its details when we come to making our constructions explicit , we feel

we define to be the identity when . in the initial step , and are isomorphisms by hypothesis and we define . in the inductive step when is a non - limit ordinal , we must show that is an isomorphism and define . the key point is that because with this equation in hand one defines as the unique morphism satisfying using the universal property of , and then it is routine to verify that . so for the inductive step it remains to verify  . but we have and so  follows since is an isomorphism . in the case where is a limit ordinal , we have stabilisation at established whenever by the induction hypothesis . thus the colimit defining is absolute ( ie preserved by all functors ) since its defining sequence from the position onwards consists only of isomorphisms . thus and are isomorphisms by lemma . by induction , the previously constructed s provide a cocone on the defining diagram of with vertex , thus one induces the isomorphism compatible with the earlier s and defines . if the sequence stabilises at then is a -algebra and is the coequaliser of and in . the unit law for is immediate from the definition of and the associative law is the commutativity of the outside of the

the systematic construction of the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product . in this paper we continue the work of to adapt the machinery of globular operads to this task . the resulting theory includes the gray tensor product of 2-categories and the crans tensor product of gray categories . moreover much of the previous work on the globular approach to higher category theory is simplified by our new foundations , and we illustrate this by giving an expedited account of many aspects of cheng s analysis of trimble s definition of weak -category . by way of application we obtain an `` ekmann - hilton '' result for braided monoidal 2-categories , and give the construction of a tensor product of -infinity algebras ."}
{"article": "cp violation , initially observed only in the system , is one feature of the standard model ( sm ) that still defies clear theoretical understanding . the ckm picture , which describes all the observed cp violation in terms of a single phase in the quark - mixing matrix , has been vindicated by the recent measurements of mixing at belle and babar . cp violation is in fact one of the necessary ingredients for generating the observed excess of baryons over antibaryons in the universe . the amount of cp violation present in the quark sector is , however , too small to generate a baryon asymmetry of the observed level of . new sources of cp violation beyond the sm are therefore a necessity . supersymmetry ( susy ) is arguably the most attractive extension of the sm , as it solves , for instance , the problem of the instability of the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale against radiative corrections . already the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) provides possible new sources of cp violation through additional cp - violating phases , which can not be rotated away by simple field redefinitions . a large number of these phases , particularly those involving sparticles of the first and to a large extent of the second generation , are severely constrained by measurements of the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron , muon , neutron as well as hg and tl . however , these constraints are model - dependent . it has been demonstrated that cancellations among different diagrams allow certain combinations of these phases to be large in a general mssm . furthermore , if the sfermions of the first two generations are sufficiently heavy , above the 1 tev range , the edm constraints on the phase of the higgsino mass parameter , in general constrained to , get weaker ; the sfermions of the third generation can still be light . non - vanishing phases of and/or the trilinear scalar couplings can induce explicit cp violation in the higgs sector via loop corrections . though these phases generate edms independently of the first two generations of sfermions , the edms are suppressed by the mass scale of the two heavy higgses . for a thorough discussion of the edms see and references therein . the above mentioned phases can also have a significant influence on the higgs production rates in the gluon fusion mode at the tevatron and the lhc . mssm cp phases can hence change the higgs phenomenology at colliders quite substantially . all this makes the mssm with cp - violating phases a very attractive proposition . it has therefore been the subject of many recent investigations , studying the implications of these phases on neutralino / chargino production and decay , on the third generation of sfermions , as well as the neutral and charged higgs sector . various cp - even and cp - odd ( t - odd ) observables , which can give information on these phases , have been identified . it is interesting to note that cp - even observables such as masses , branching ratios , cross sections , etc . , often afford more precise probes thanks to the larger magnitude of the effects . for direct evidence of cp violation , however , cp - odd / t - odd observables as discussed e.g. in have to be measured . the latest study of the sector in demonstrates that it may be possible to determine the real and imaginary parts of to a precision of 23% from a fit of the mssm lagrange parameters to masses , cross sections and branching ratios at a future linear collider ( lc ) . this requires that both the , mass eigenstates can be produced at the lc and the branching ratios measured with high precision . in the sector the precision on is worse , around 1020% for low and about 37% for large . in this paper , we show that the longitudinal polarization of fermions produced in sfermion decays , i.e. and with a third generation ( s)quark or ( s)lepton , can also be used as a probe of cp phases . the fermion polarization can give complementary information to the decay branching ratios and will in particular be useful if the branching ratios can not be measured with high enough precision or if one decay channel dominates . the average polarization of fermions produced in sfermion decays carries information on the mixing as well as on the gaugino higgsino mixing . the polarizations that can be measured are those of top and tau ; both can be inferred from the decay lepton distributions . it is its large mass that causes the to decay before hadronization and thus the decay products can carry information about its polarization . for taus , also the energy distribution of the decay pions can be used . the polarization of the decay fermions has been used for studies of mssm parameter determination in the cp - conserving case in . for the cp - violating case , the phase dependence of the longitudinal fermion polarization has been mentioned in . we extend these studies by discussing in detail the sensitivity of the fermion polarization to cp - violating phases in the mssm . the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we summarize our notation for the description of the sfermion , neutralino and chargino systems in the mssm with cp violation . in section 3 , we discuss fermion polarization in sfermion decays to neutralinos , with . we present numerical results on the polarization as a function of different mssm parameters and discuss the sensitivity to cp - violating phases in the sfermion and neutralino sectors . in section 4 we perform an analogous analysis for decays . in section 5 we summarize the results and present our conclusions . ignoring intergenerational mixing , the sfermion mass matrices can be written as a series of matrices , each of which describes sfermions of a specific flavour : with { m {\\sf {r}}}^2 & = & m^2 {\\ti r } + e f\\,m z^2 \\cos 2\\b\\,\\sin^2\\t w + m f^2 , \\\\ a f & = & a f - \\mu^*\\ , \\ { \\cot\\b , \\tan\\b \\ } = |a f|\\ , e^{i\\phsf } \\ , , \\ ] ] for up , down-type sfermions ; , and are the mass , electric charge and the third component of the weak isospin of the partner fermion , respectively ; , and are soft susy - breaking parameters for each family , and is the higgsino mass parameter ; and can have complex phases : and . + according to eq . , is diagonalized by a unitary rotation matrix . the weak eigenstates and are thus related to their mass eigenstates and by with and the sfermion mixing angle and phase . since the off - diagonal element of is proportional to , this mixing is mostly relevant to the third generation , , on which we concentrate in the following . the mass eigenvalues are given by by convention , we choose to be the lighter mass eigenstate , . notice also that . for the mixing angle we choose which places in the 2nd quadrant of the unit circle . the mixing is large if , with if and if . moreover , we see that the phase dependence of and is determined by . this dependence is strongest if . this issue will be discussed in more detail in the numerical analyses of sections 3 and 4 . in the basis the neutralino mass matrix is : the gaugino mass parameters and the higgsino mass parameter can in principle all be complex . the phase of can be rotated away , which leaves us with two phases in this sector : , the phase of , and , the phase of . + the matrix of eq . is diagonalized by the unitary mixing matrix : where , , are the ( non - negative ) masses of the physical neutralino states . we choose the ordering . a concise discussion of the neutralino sector with complex phases can be found in . the chargino mass matrix is : it is diagonalized by the two unitary matrices and , where are the masses of the physical chargino states with . the sfermion interaction with neutralinos is ( ; ) where the and couplings are for stops and sbottoms , and for staus , with the yukawa couplings given by the gaugino interaction conserves the helicity of the sfermion while the higgsino interaction flips it . in the limit , the average polarization of the fermion coming from the decay can therefore be calculated as using eqs . , and as well as , we obtain , for the decay ( omitting the overall factor and dropping the sfermion and neutralino indices for simplicity ) : \\,.\\ ] ] we see that the phase dependence of is the largest for maximal sfermion mixing  and if the neutralino has both sizeable gaugino and higgsino components . it is , moreover , enhanced if the yukawa coupling is large . furthermore , is sensitive to cp violation even if just one phase , in either the neutralino or the sfermion sector , is non - zero . in particular , if only and thus only the sfermion mixing matrix has a non - zero phase , the phase - dependent term becomes if , on the other hand , only is non - zero we get \\,\\sin 2\\t \\,.\\ ] ] the polarization , eq . , depends only on couplings but not on masses . for the numerical analysis we therefore use , , , , and as input parameters , assuming to satisfy edm constraints more easily : assuming cancellations for the 1-loop contributions and the cp - odd higgs mass parameter gev , 1-loop and 2-loop contributions to the electron edm ( eedm ) , as well as their sum , stay below the experimental limit . we use the formulae of for the 2-loop contributions . in order not to vary too many parameters , we use , moreover , the gut relation and choose and ( large but not maximal mixing ) throughout this section . the free parameters in our analysis are thus , , and the phases , . before we present the numerical results , a comment is in order : cp violation in the neutralino sector is determined by the phases of and , while originates from relative phases of and . for stops the mixing is dominated by , while for sbottoms and staus it is dominated by ; quite generally we have unless , and unless . more precisely , for , any can be reached by an appropriate choice of , independent of . for , however , is restricted by . in the special case of and , . in the stop sector this is not a problem since can in general be easily achieved . for sbottoms and staus , choosing freely leads , however , to quite large , which may in some cases create problems with charge- or colour - breaking minima .

; ) . this polarization is considered as a useful tool for the mssm parameter determination . in decays into charginos , the polarization depends on the phase of . since this dependence is weak in the case of , does not provide a promising probe of cp phases ( on the other hand , exactly this feature can make useful for consistency tests of gaugino higgsino mixing ) . in decays , the dependence on can be rather large ; in addition , also the phase of the sbottom - mixing matrix plays a role . if , . we found that this case can be difficult to distinguish from the cp - conserving case by measuring . if , however , a deviation from is observed , these phases can be constrained and also limits on can be derived . the decays and provide a more effective probe of cp violation because an additional phase , the phase of , contributes . we found that cp phases can have a significant effect on the top and tau polarizations , especially if the involved neutralino has a sizeable higgsino component . if the parameters of the neutralino sector can be measured precisely , e.g. in annihilation with polarized beams , and can be useful for the determination of cp phases . in particular , since unless is very large , a measurement of can give information on . in this respect it is important to note that ( for fixed masses ) the sfermion production cross sections do not depend on cp phases . in the sfermion sector , these can be manifest in branching ratios as discussed in , polarization of the decay fermions as discussed in this paper , and cp - odd asymmetries . branching ratios are in general rather difficult to measure with high precision . the information that can be gained from branching ratios is also limited if one decay channel dominates , e.g. in case of a light stau . this makes the polarization of the decay fermions a very interesting possibility to explore cp phases . last but not least we note that the computations in this paper , leading to effects of a few percent , have been performed at tree level . the influence of radiative corrections can be of comparable size and will therefore have to be taken into account for precision analyses . a measurement of the cp phases in the sfermion/ sector will also complement cp studies of the higgs sector , since in the mssm higgs - sector cp violation is generated through quantum corrections . last but not least we emphazise that , since the effects can be large , the possibility of cp violation should be taken into account in precision susy parameter analyses , especially in a general analysis project as envisaged in . t.g . acknowledges the financial support of the institut fr hochenergiephysik in vienna and the cern theory division . r.g . wishes to thank the cern theory division and lapth for hospitality and financial support , where this work was completed . thanks the centre for high energy physics in bangalore for hospitality and financial support . rg wishes to acknowledge the partial support of the department of science and technology , india , under project number sp / s2/k-01/2000-ii . the sm constants used in the numerical analysis are : a. d. sakharov , pisma zh . teor . fiz . * 5 * ( 1967 ) 32 , jetp lett . 6 , 24 ( 1967 ) . for a recent summary , see a. d. dolgov , hep - ph/0211260 . c. l. bennett et al . , astrophys . j. suppl . * 148 * , 1 ( 2003 ) . for a review , see e.g. m. dine and a. kusenko , rev . phys . * 76 * , 1 ( 2004 ) . see , e.g.h . e. haber and g. l. kane , phys . rept . * 117 * ( 1985 ) 75 . t. ibrahim and p. nath , phys . b * 418 * , 98 ( 1998 ) ;

{"article": "the variability of ex lup was discovered by miss e. janssen in 1944 while examining spectral plates at the harvard observatory ( mclaughlin 1946 ) . herbig ( 1950 ) first pointed out the similarity of ex lupi s spectral characteristics and t tauri stars with strong emission lines of h , caii , feii , and hei . in one of the spectrograms he obtained in 1949/1950 the h and caii lines clearly show an inverse p cygni profile . herbig ( 1977a ) assigned the spectral type of m0:ev using the 5850 - 6700 range . photographic and visual light - curves covering a century of observations revealed the irregular photometric behaviour of the star ( mclaughlin 1946 , bateson et al . outbursts of up to 5 magnitudes may occur , but the star normally shows only small amplitude irregular variations . the most prominent events last about one year . the typical recurrence time scale of outbursts is of the order of a decade . + up to now there are only a few other stars known with comparable outburst characteristics ( herbig 1989 ) . this small group of very active t tauri stars has been called exors or sometimes sub - fuors . both names point to an affinity to the so called fu orionis stars ( fuors ) . fuors are another group of young low mass stars with even stronger outbursts lasting for decades . unlike exors , during an outburst fuor spectra turn from t tauri characteristics to that of much earlier f or g supergiants lacking strong line emission ( herbig 1977b ) . fuors have high mass accretion rates ( ,hartmann 1991 ) and strong winds ( e.g. calvet et al . 1993 ) and they may be the source that drive herbig - haro flows ( reipurth 1989 ) . + exors are little studied , but potentially of great interest because they may represent an intermediate level of activity between ordinary active t tauri stars and full blown fu orionis eruptions . in order to cast further light on this interpretation , we have followed some exors spectroscopically and photometrically during 1993 and 1994 . the star ex lup has been at a low level of activity during the 1980 s . in the early 1990 s this situation changed and the star became active ( jones et al . 1993 , hughes et al . amateur observations ( variable star section of the royal astronomical society of new zealand , unpublished ) indicated a strong brightening in february / march 1994 . patten ( 1994 ) reports some follow - up photometric and low resolution spectroscopic observations of the same outburst . + in this paper we present part of our optical observations of ex lup taken at eso , la silla . we concentrate on data obtained during the outburst in march 1994 and include some spectroscopic observations carried out in august 1994 when the star only exhibited post - outburst low level activity . a complete presentation of our data will appear in a future paper . differential ccd photometry has been carried out at the 0.9m - dutch and the 1.54m - danish telescopes . this photometry was later calibrated with respect to standard stars including extinction and colour corrections . all reductions have been made with the apphot package in iraf . typical errors ( 1 ) in the differential photometry are b=0.005 , v=0.004 , r=0.004 whereas the absolute magnitude scale itself is accurate to about 0.01 in all three colours . + the resulting lightcurves in b , v , and r are presented in fig . 1 . the maximum occurred between february 25 and march 4 ( herbig , priv . the fading tail of the eruption can be described as an exponential decline with small fluctuations superimposed . variability of more than 0.1mag is present on timescales of less than one hour ( e.g. march 6.3 , see also patten 1994 ) . figure 2 displays the colour change in b - v during the decline . the star clearly becomes redder when fading . for comparison we have included some points close to minimum light taken from the literature . the outburst amplitude was about v=2.0mag and b=2.6mag . spectroscopic observations in the blue spectral range were carried out during the first few nights in march 1994 on the eso-1.52 m telescope using the boller & chivens spectrograph at 1.2 resolution . after the decline of ex lup we obtained post - outburst spectra in the same wavelength region at resolutions of 1.5 and 12 at the 3.5m - ntt with emmi in august 1994 . all spectra have been reduced with the ctioslit package in iraf . observations of spectrophotometric standards and nightly extinction curves allowed for a flux calibration . + in fig.3 we present two spectra of ex lup : one close to the outburst maximum and the other at low activity almost half a year after the eruption . some of the emission lines of h , caii , feii , hei , and heii are indicated . under the assumption that the total light can be decomposed into an underlying t tauri star photosphere , a continuum source , and superimposed emission lines , we now discuss the different spectral components and their variability . a powerful method to determine the continuum excess emission is to determine the veiling by comparison with spectra of stars of the same spectral type and luminosity class but lacking any disk signature ( hartigan et al . 1989 , 1991 ) . the accuracy of the veiling determination decreases rapidly when the emission component exceeds the photospheric luminosity . in the case of ex lup during its eruption we therefore did not intend to derive the veiling and the true excess emission spectrum by comparison with spectral type standards , but we could examine the spectral variability caused by the outburst . + no photospheric absorption features are seen during the outburst ( upper spectrum in fig.3 ) but they appear in the post - outburst spectrum . thus the major source of variability presumably is a featureless continuum . therefore , a difference spectrum between outburst and post - outburst spectra should be a good measure of the continuum emission spectrum . in fig . 4 we plot two difference spectra at low resolution . the first shows the difference between an outburst ( march 3 ) and a post - outburst ( august 16 ) spectrum , while the second shows the difference between two post - outburst ( august 18 and 16 ) spectra which displays normal low - level variability . the continuum emission spectrum displaying the normal low - level activity is bluer than the continuum emission present during outburst . the most intriguing features in the spectra of ex lup are strong emission lines . the balmer series can be seen up to h15 especially during times of minimum activity . equivalent widths and fluxes of individual lines are given in table 1 . essentially all strong emission lines have increasing fluxes as the star brightens . however due to the steep rise of the continuum the equivalent widths decrease , which is also evident in the data from patten ( 1994 ) at h , h , and h during the maximum . obviously the caii lines have a larger flux amplification during the outburst than the balmer lines . there is some indication that line fluxes of metals do not increase while the star goes into outburst ( cai , feii , srii ) . + lrrrr & & & & + identification & w & w & flux & flux + & & & & + & & & & + & & & & + h11 3771 & -1.0 & -4.2 & 16 & 6 + h10 3798 & -1.5 & -7.0 & 25 & 9 + h 9 3835 & -1.2 & -12.1 & 20 & 16 + h 8 3889 & -2.7 & -13.0 & 44 & 18 + sii 3906 & -0.2 & -0.8 & 3 & 1 + caii 3934 & -7.7 & -12.0 & 123 & 15 + .comparison of selected emission lines at different levels of activity . equivalent widths and line fluxes during the outburst measured on march 3  and in the post -

outburst difference spectrum corresponds to a velocity of km / s . photospheric features of the underlying t tauri star can be seen only in the post - outburst spectra . figure 6 shows the region around cai 4227 , which is the strongest stellar absorption line , in two post - outburst spectra . the difference of these two spectra no longer exhibits the absorption line , and the change of total flux by about 40% is therefore due to continuum emission rather than photospheric variability . + the photospheric lines of the t tauri star are veiled , even at minimum brightness . the superimposed emission line spectrum additionally fills in many absorption lines . the measurement of the veiling is therefore rather difficult . we find a good fit to the observed strength of absorption lines by introducing a flat continuum emission equal to the photospheric continuum of the underlying star ( veiling r=1 , comparison with hd 202560 , spectral type m0v ) at 4200 when the brightness of ex lup is v=13.0 . the outburst of ex lup can be understood in terms of a mass accretion event causing increased continuum emission in a hot region close to the surface of the star where the infalling matter finally releases its kinetic energy . the total light of the photosphere and the hot region becomes dominated by the latter and therefore it is much bluer during the outburst . furthermore all photospheric lines are heavily veiled ( assuming that r=1 at minimum light then the veiling during outburst would be r ) . the different slope of the continuum emission in the outburst compared to the post - outburst ( see fig.4 ) indicates that the hot region is cooler during outburst ( assuming no change in extinction due to circumstellar matter ) . this interpretation then implies a dramatic expansion of the hot region in order to account for the observed rise in luminosity during the outburst . + the inverse p cygni profiles of many emission lines prove the infall motion of accreted material . the velocity derived from the redward displacement of the absorption component of these lines are of the order of 300 km / s and therefore much higher than those assumed in the classical boundary layer model for t tauri stars ( lynden - bell & pringle , 1974 ) . however , these high infall velocities may result from magnetospherically mediated disk accretion ( camenzind 1990 , knigl 1991 , hartmann et al . high resolution studies of classical t tauri stars have revealed a large fraction of stars exhibiting inverse p cygni structures ( e.g. appenzeller 1977 , edwards et al . , 1994 ) . the usual low level variability might be caused by geometrical effects during the rotation of the star . the more dramatic outbursts could be attributed to episodic changes in the magnetosphere , resulting in more extended infall flows of circumstellar material onto the star . + acknowledgements : we thank g.herbig for alerting us to the outburst of ex lup in early march 1994 . also we are grateful to the following observers for kindly providing part of their observing time : t.abbott , j.f.claeskens , d.de winter , c.flynn , h.jerjen , a.manchado , f.patat , n.robichon , p.stein . tl & wb were supported by student fellowships of the european southern observatory . wb acknowledges support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) under grant yo 5/16 -

{"article": "the liquid - gas ( lg ) phase transition in nuclear matter remains illusive and a hot research topic despite of the great efforts devoted to understanding its nature and experimental manifestations by the nuclear physics community over many years . for a recent review , see , e.g. , refs. . most of the previous studies have focused on the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter . while in an asymmetric nuclear matter , the lg phase transition is expected to display some distinctly new features because of the isospin degree of freedom and the associated interactions and additional conservation laws . this expectation together with the need to understand better properties of asymmetric nuclear matter relevant for both nuclear physics and astrophysics have stimulated a lot of new work recentlyliko97,ma99,wang00,su00,lee01,li01,natowitz02,li02,chomaz03,sil04,lizx04,chomaz06,li07 . moreover , the study on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter has received recently a strong boost from the impressive progress in developing more advanced radioactive beams that can be used to create transiently in terrestrial laboratories large volumes of highly asymmetric nuclear matter . though significant progress has been made recently in studying properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and the lg phase transition in it , there are still many challenging questions to be answered . among the main difficulties are our poor understanding about the isovector nuclear interaction and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . fortunately , recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion reactions have allowed us to put a stringent constraint on the symmetry energy of neutron - rich matter at sub - normal densities betty04,chen05,lichen05 . it is therefore interesting to investigate how the constrained symmetry energy may allow us to better understand the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter . moreover , both the isovector ( i.e. , the nuclear symmetry potential ) and isoscalar parts of the single nucleon potential should be momentum dependent . however , effects of the momentum - dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter were not thoroughly investigated previously . we report here our recent progress in investigating effects of the isospin and momentum dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within a self - consistent thermal model using three different interactions . the first one is the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions . the second one is a momentum - independent interaction ( mid ) which leads to a fully momentum independent single nucleon potential , and the third one is an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction ( emdyi ) in which the isoscalar part of the single nucleon potential is momentum dependent but the isovector part of the single nucleon potential is momentum independent . we note that the mdi interaction is realistic , while the other two are only used as references in order to explore effects of the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction . in the isospin and momentum - dependent mdi interaction , the potential energy density of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density , temperature and isospin asymmetry is expressed as follows , in the mean field approximation , eq .  leads to the following single particle potential for a nucleon with momentum and isospin in the thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter das03,chen05 in the above the isospin is for neutrons and for protons , and is the phase space distribution function at coordinate and momentum . the detailed values of the parameters and can be found in ref . and have been assumed to be temperature independent here . the isospin and momentum - dependent mdi interaction gives the binding energy per nucleon of mev , incompressibility mev and the symmetry energy of mev for cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density . the different values in the mdi interaction are introduced to vary the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy while keeping other properties of the nuclear equation of state fixed . we note that the mdi interaction has been extensively used in the transport model for studying isospin effects in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei li04b , chen04,chen05,lichen05,li05pion , li06,yong061,yong062,yong07 . in particular , the isospin diffusion data from nscl / msu have constrained the value of to be between and for nuclear matter densities less than about . we will thus in the present work consider the two values of and with giving a softer symmetry energy while giving a stiffer symmetry energy . the potential part of the symmetry energy at zero temperature can be parameterized by ( % { \\rho { 0}})^{g(x ) } , \\]]where the values of and for different can be found in ref . . in the momentum - independent mid interaction , the potential energy density of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density and isospin asymmetry can be written as the parameters , and are determined by the incompressibility of cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density as in ref . and is again set to be mev as in the mdi interaction . and is just same as eq .  . so the mid interaction reproduces very well the eos of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter with the mdi interaction at zero temperature for both and . the single nucleon potential in the mid interaction can be directly obtained as with { \\tau } { \\delta } \\notag \\\\ & + & ( 18.6-f(x))(g(x)-1)( { \\rho { 0}})^{g(x)}{\\delta } ^{2}. \\ ] ] the momentum - dependent part in the mdi interaction is also isospin dependent while the mid interaction is fully momentum independent . in order to see the effect of the momentum dependence of the isovector part of the single nucleon potential ( nuclear symmetry potential ) , we can construct an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction , called extended mdyi ( emdyi ) interaction since it has the same functional form as the well - known mdyi interaction for symmetric nuclear matter . in the emdyi interaction , the potential energy density of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density , temperature and isospin asymmetry is written as here is the phase space distribution function of symmetric nuclear matter at total density and temperature . again has the same expression as eq .  . we set and , and , and have the same values as in the mdi interaction , so that the emdyi interaction also gives the same eos of asymmetric nuclear matter as the mdi interaction at zero temperature for both and . the single nucleon potential in the emdyi interaction can be obtained aswhere and is the same as eq .  which implies that the symmetry potential is identical for the emdyi and mid interactions . therefore , in the emdyi interaction , the isoscalar part of the single nucleon potential is momentum dependent but the nuclear symmetry potential is not . at zero temperature , and all the integrals in above expressions can be calculated analytically , while at a finite temperature , the phase space distribution function becomes the fermi distribution where is the chemical potential of proton or neutron and can be determined from in the above , is the proton or neutron mass and is the proton or neutron single nucleon potential in different interactions . from a self - consistency iteration scheme , the chemical potential and the distribution function can be determined numerically . from the chemical potential and the distribution function , the energy per nucleon can be obtained as . \\]]furthermore , we can obtain the entropy per nucleon as dp \\]]with the occupation probabilityfinally , the pressure can be calculated from the thermodynamic relation \\rho+\\sum {\\tau } \\mu { \\tau } \\rho { \\tau } . \\ ] ] with the above theoretical models , we can now study the lg phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter . the phase coexistence is governed by the gibbs conditions and for the asymmetric nuclear matter two - phase coexistence equations are where and stand for liquid phase and gas phase , respectively . the chemical stability condition is given by the gibbs conditions  and  for phase equilibrium require equal pressures and chemical potentials for two phases with different concentrations and asymmetries . for a fixed pressure , the two solutions thus form the edges of a rectangle in the proton and neutron chemical potential isobars as a function of isospin asymmetry and can be found by means of the geometrical construction method . at mev for the mdi and mid interactions(left ) and the emdyi interaction(right ) with and . the geometrical construction used to obtain the isospin asymmetries and chemical potentials in the two coexisting phases is also shown . taken from ref . . ] at mev for the mdi and mid interactions(left ) and the emdyi interaction(right ) with and . the geometrical construction used to obtain the isospin asymmetries and chemical potentials in the two coexisting phases is also shown . taken from ref . . ] we calculate the chemical potential isobars at mev , which is a typical temperature of lg phase transition . the solid curves shown in the left panel of fig . are the proton and neutron chemical potential isobars as a function of the isospin asymmetry at a fixed temperature mev and pressure mev by using the mdi and mid interactions with and . the resulting rectangles from the geometrical construction are also shown by dotted lines in the left panel of fig . . when the pressure increases and approaches the critical pressure , an inflection point will appear for proton and neutron chemical potential isobars . above the critical pressure , the chemical potential of neutrons ( protons ) increases ( decreases ) monotonically with and the chemical instability disappears . in the left panel of fig . , we also show the chemical potential isobar at the critical pressure by the dashed curves . at the critical pressure , the rectangle is degenerated to a line vertical to the axis as shown by dash - dotted lines . the values of the critical pressure are , , and mev for the mdi interaction with , mid interaction with , mdi interaction with and mid interaction with , respectively . shown in the right panel of fig . is the chemical potential isobar as a function of the isospin asymmetry at mev by using the emdyi interaction with and . compared with the results from the mdi and mid interactions , the main difference is that the left ( and right ) extrema of and do not correspond to the same but they do for the mdi and mid interactions as shown in the left panel . the chemical potential of neutrons increases more rapidly with pressure than that of protons in this temperature . at lower pressures , for example , mev/ as shown in panel ( a ) , the rectangle can be accurately constructed and thus the gibbs conditions  and  have two solutions . due to the asynchronous variation of and with pressure , we will get a limiting pressure above which no rectangle can be constructed and the coexistence equations  and  have no solution . panel ( b ) shows the case at the limiting pressure with and mev/ for and , respectively . with increasing pressure , in panel ( c ) passes through an inflection point while still has a chemically unstable region , and in panel ( d ) passes through an inflection point while increases monotonically with . for each interaction , the two different values of correspond to two different phases with different densities and the lower density phase ( with larger value ) defines a gas phase while the higher density phase ( with smaller value ) defines a liquid phase . collecting all such pairs of and thus forms the binodal surface . mev in the mdi and mid interactions with and . the critical point ( cp ) , the points of equal concentration ( ec ) and maximal asymmetry ( ma ) are also indicated . ( b ) the section of binodal surface at mev in the emdyi interaction with and . lp represents the limiting pressure . taken from ref . . ] in fig . ( a ) , we show the section of the binodal surface at mev for the mdi and mid interactions with and . on the left side of the binodal surface there only exists a liquid phase and on the right side only a gas phase exists . in the region of filet mignon is the coexistence phase of liquid phase and gas phase . interestingly , we can see from fig . ( a ) that the stiffer symmetry energy  significantly lowers the critical point ( cp ) and makes the maximal asymmetry ( ma ) a little smaller . meanwhile , the momentum dependence in the interaction ( mdi ) lifts the cp in a larger amount , while it seems to have no effects on the ma point . in addition , just as expected , the value of does not affect the equal concentration ( ec ) point while the momentum dependence lifts it slightly ( by about mev/ ) . these features clearly indicate that the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region in hot asymmetric nuclear matter is very sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy giving a higher critical pressure and a larger area of phase - coexistence region . meanwhile , the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region are also sensitive to the momentum dependence . the mdi interaction has a larger area of phase coexistence region and a larger value of the critical pressure , compared to the result of mid interaction in the temperature of mev . ( b ) displays the section of the binodal surface at mev by using the emdyi interaction with and . we can see that the curve is cut off at the limiting pressure with and mev/ for and , respectively . we can also see that the limiting pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region are still sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy  giving a higher limit pressure and a larger area of phase - coexistence region in this temperature . comparing the results of the mdi and mid interactions shown in fig . ( a ) , we can see that for pressures lower than the limiting pressure , the binodal surface from the emdyi interaction is similar to that from the mdi interaction . this feature implies that the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential has little influence on the lg phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter while the momentum dependence of the isoscalar single nucleon potential significantly changes the area of phase - coexistence region for pressures lower than the limiting pressure . for pressures above the limiting pressure , the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar and isovector single nucleon potentials becomes important . in summary , we have studied the liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within a self - consistent thermal model using three different nuclear effective interactions , namely , the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions , the momentum - independent mid interaction , and the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction . at zero temperature , the above three interactions give the same eos for asymmetric nuclear matter . by analyzing liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter with the above three interactions , we find that the boundary of the phase - coexistence region is very sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . a softer symmetry energy leads to a higher critical pressure and a larger area of the phase - coexistence region . in addition , the area of phase - coexistence region are also seen to be sensitive to the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction . for the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction , a limiting pressure above which the liquid - gas phase transition can not take place has been found . this work was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china under grant nos . 10334020 , 10575071 , and 10675082 , moe of china under project ncet-05 - 0392 , shanghai rising - star program under grant no . 06qa14024 , the srf for rocs , sem of china , the china major state basic research development program under contract no . 2007cb815004 , the us national science foundation under grant no . phy-0652548 and the research corporation under award no .", "summary": "the liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter is investigated within a self - consistent thermal model using different interactions with or without isospin and/or momentum dependence . the boundary of the phase - coexistence region is shown to be sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy as well as the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction ."}
{"article": "the study of the phase transition of frustrated spin systems on two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices is a central problem in modern condensed mater physics . a competition of exchange interaction can lead to frustration , where spatial arrangement of magnetic ions in a crystal for which a simultaneous antiparallel ordering of all interacting spin is impossible . in particular , one of the frustrated 2d models most discussed is the quantum spin- heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with competing nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) antiferromagnetic exchange interactions ( known as model ) . the criticality of this heisenberg model on a square lattice are relatively well known at . there are two magnetically long - range ordered phases at small and at large values of separated by an intermediate quantum paramagnetic phase without magnetic long - range order in the region between and , where the properties of these disordered phase are still under intensive debate . for , the system possesses antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order with wave vector , with a staggered magnetization smaller than the saturated value ( quantum fluctuations ) , which vanished continuously when . for we have two degenerate collinear states which are the helical states with pitch vectors and . these two collinear states are characterized by a parallel spin orientation of nearest neighbors in vertical ( or horizontal ) direction and an antiparallel spin orientation of nearest neighbors in horizontal ( or vertical ) direction , and therefore exhibit nel order within the initial sublattice a and b. at , the magnetization jumps from a nonzero to a zero value . the phase transition from nel to the quantum paramagnetic state is second order , whereas the transition from the collinear to the quantum paramagnetic state is first order . et al . have shown that the intermediate quantum paramagnetic is a ( singlet ) plaquette crystal , and the ground and first excited states are separated by a finite gap . the interest to study the two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet have been greatly stimulated by its experimental realization in vanadium phosphates compounds , such as livosio , livogeo , and vomoo , which might be described by this frustrated model in the case of  . these isostructural compounds are characterized by a layered structure containing v  ions . the structure of v layer suggest that the superexchange is similar . in these compounds a second order phase transition to a long - range ordered magnetic phase has been observed . nmr spin - lattice relaxation measurements below shows that the order is collinear . due to the two - fold degeneracy of the ground - state for it is not possible to say a priori which will be the magnetic wave vector ( i.e. , and ) below . on the other hand , such a scenario can change by considering spin - lattice coupling which will lift the degeneracy of the ground - state and will lower its energy . then , any structural distortion should inevitably reduce this competing interactions and thus reduces the frustration . in the case of this frustrated magnetic materials , the competing interactions are inequivalent but their topology and magnitudes can be tuned so that the strong quantum fluctuations destroy the long - range ordering . experimentally the ground state phase diagram of frustrated compounds , described by the model , can be explored continuously from high to the low regime by applying high pressures ( p ) , which modify the bonding lengths and angles . recent results from x - ray diffraction measurements on the livosio compound has shown that the ratio decreases by about when the pressure increases from to gpa . a generalization of the heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on a square lattice was introduced by nersesyan and tsvelik and studied by other groups , the so - called model . in the model is considered inequivalence nn couplings and in the two orthogonal spatial lattice dimensions with all the nnn bonds across the diagonals to have the same strength . study of extensive band structure calculations for the vanadium phosphates abvo(po) ( ab = pb , srzn , bazn , and bacd ) have indicated four inequivalent exchange couplings : and between nn and and between nnn . for example , in srznvo(po) was estimated and causing a distortion of the spin lattice . this spatial anisotropy tends to narrow the critical region and destroys it completely at a certain value of the interchain parameter . on the other hand , by using the continuum limit of the spin- model starykh and balents have shown that this transition splits into two , with the presence of an intermediate quantum paramagnetic ( columnar dimer ) phase for . bishop , et al , by using coupled cluster treatment found the surprising and novel result that there exists a quantum triple point ( * qtp * ) with coordinates at  , below which there is a second - order phase transition between the * af * and * caf * phases while above this * qtp * are these two ordered phases separated by the intermediate magnetically disordered phase ( vbs or rvb ) . the order parameters of both the * af * and * caf * phases vanish continuously both below and above the * qtp * , which is typical of second - order phase transition . there is some evidence that the transition between the * caf * and intermediate phases is of first - order . using exact diagonalization with small lattice of  size , the intermediate * qp * phase for all interval of $ ] has been obtained for the pure spin- model on a square lattice . these results are in accordance with results obtained by starykh and balentes , that predicted not the * qtp * in the ground - state phase diagram recently observed by bishop , et al. . the ground state ( gs ) properties of the two - dimensional frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet have been investigated by various methods . the exact diagonalization starts from singlet states on pairs of sites , which cover the whole 2d lattice . however , the manifold of these states which can be constructed is nonorthogonal and overcomplete . this numerical methods are limited to small clusters due to storage problems . the computation on the largest cluster has been performed by schulz and co - workes years ago . in spite of the great improvements achieved during this time , it is not possible so far to repeat this calculation for the next interesting cluster . this is only possible with other technique , as the quantum monte carlo simulation . due to the progress in computer hardware and the increased efficiency in programing , very recently the gs of the quantum spin-1/2 model have been calculated by the lanczos algoritm for a square lattice with sites . the theoretical treatment of the frustrated quantum models is far from being trivial . many of the standard many - body methods , such as quantum monte carlo techniques , may fail or become computationally infeasible to implement if frustration is present due to the minus - sign problem . hence , there is considerable interest in any method that can deal with frustrated spin systems . this considerable qualitative difference in the ground state phase diagram in the plane of the quantum spin- model further motivates us to study this issue by alternative methods . using a variational approximation , in which plaquettes of four spins are treated exactly , oliveira has studied the ground state phase diagram of the pure heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice , where the quantitative results are in good accordance with a more sophisticated method ( exact diagonalization ) . in this work , we generalize this variational method to treat the anisotropic square lattice ( model ) . the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec . ii , the model is presented and a brief discussion of results . in sec . iii , the method is applied for the case of one plaquette with four spins interacting with other plaquette type mean field approximation . main results will be presented in sec . iv , as well as some discussions . finally , in sec . v we will give a brief summary . the critical behavior of the quantum spin- heisenberg model has been studied for many years , but very little has been done in the anisotropic square lattice case , which is described by following hamiltonian : where is the spin- pauli spin operators , the index labels the ( row ) and ( column ) components of the lattice sites . the first sum runs over all nn and the second sum runs over all nnn pairs . we denote the hamiltonian ( 1 ) by model , with strength along the row direction , along the column direction , along the diagonals , and we assume all couplings to be positive with . the classical  model ( 1 ) has only two ordered ground - states : * af * ( or nel ) for and columnar stripe ( * caf * ) for separated by a first - order line at . quantum fluctuations play a significant role in the magnetic phase diagram of the system at zero temperature . we will investigate the role of quantum fluctuations on the stability of the nel and collinear phases . in the case ( quantum limit ) , the line splits into two phase transitions , where the ordered states ( * af * and * caf * ) are separated by an intermediate quantum paramagnetic ( * qp * ) phase , both on a square lattice . exact diagonalization has estimated a critical line at , for the transition between the * caf * and * qp * states , and at between the * af * and * qp * states . the phase diagram in the plane obtained is in accordance with starykh and balents . however , the existence of * qtp * ( quantum triple point ) that was predicted by bishop , et al . , is not present in their obtained phase diagram . moreover , they found only presence of second - order phase transitions in the phase diagram . this contradictory qualitative results ( existence or not of * qtp * ) is the primary motivation behind this present work . on the other hand , a critical endpoint ( * ce * ) is a point in the phase diagram where a critical line meets and is truncated by a first - order line . this * ce * appear in the phase diagram of many physical systems such as binary fluid mixtures , superfluids , binary alloys , liquid crystals , certain ferromagnets , etc , and have been known for over a century . despite the * ce * long history , new singularities at the * ce * were predicted . fisher and upton argued that a new singularity in the curvature of the first - order phase transition line should arise at a * ce*. this prediction was confirmed by fisher and barbosas phenomenological studies for an exactly solvable spherical model . in conclusion of the analysis of the multicritical behavior observed in the ground - state phase diagram in the plane for the model , we have the presence of a quantum critical endpoint ( * qce * ) and not * qtp * as mentioned other works therefore , the objective of this work is to obtain the * qce * using the variational method , that was developed previously by oliveira in the pure limit  case . we first express the fluctuations around the classical ground state ( * af * and * caf * phases ) , where consider a trial vector state for the ground state as a product of plaquette state . we denote the plaquettes by label , that is composed of four spins , where it do not overlap ( mean field ) on the square lattice as illustrated in figure 1 . each plaquette state is given by and spin operators that are considered in eq . ( 2 ) . ] where \\{ , } is the vector basis with , \\{ } are real variational parameters obeying the normalization condition . with this choice of vector states , the mean value of the spin operator in each site of the plaquette is given by , where the components in the and directions are null . using the trial vector state defined in the eq . ( 2 ) , we obtain the magnetizations at each site that are given by and where we have used the same set of parameters ( canonical transformation ) of ref. , i.e. , , and , which obeys the normalization condition . the ground state energy per spin and unit of , , is given by with and , %\\ ] ] where is the mean value of a given observable calculated in the vector state of the plaquette as illustrated in fig . the variational energy can be evaluated using the properties of the spin- pauli operator components , i.e. , , and , that is expressed for + \\nonumber\\\\ & 2\\left ( 1-\\lambda\\right ) \\left ( y^{2}v^{2}-z^{2}\\omega^{2}\\right ) + 2x\\left ( y\\lambda+z\\right ) + \\alpha\\left . %\\ ] ] to obtain the minimum energy with a boundary condition given by normalization , we use the lagrange multiplier method which correspond the minimization of the functional the stationary solutions  are obtained by solving the set of nonlinear equations {c}% -\\left ( \\lambda+1\\right ) x-4\\left ( \\lambda+1\\right ) xu^{2}+2\\left ( y\\lambda+z\\right ) + 12\\alpha xu^{2}=2\\eta x\\\\ \\left ( 1-\\lambda\\right ) \\left ( y+4yv^{2}\\right ) + 2x\\lambda-2\\alpha\\left ( y -

order phase transition . a simple fitting of the form in the vicinity of the second - order transition gives the same classical value for the critical exponent . on the other hand , for and the staggered magnetization increases monotonically with the frustration parameter in the * caf * phase , with a discontinuity of at , which is a first - order phase transition . for , the * qp * intermediate phase between the two ordered states ( * af * and * caf * ) disappears , and a direct transition between the magnetically ordered * af * and * caf * located at the crossing point correspondent to the classical value . the ground state  phase diagram in the plane is displayed in fig . the solid line indicate the critical points and the dashed lines represent first - order frontiers . we observe three different phases , namely : * af * ( antiferromagnetic ) , * caf * ( collinear antiferromagnetic ) and * qp * ( quantum paramagnetic ) . the * af * and * qp * phases are separated by a second - order transition line , while the * qp * and * caf * phases are separated by a first - order transition line . the presence of the interchain parameter has the general effect of suppressing the * qp * phase . the * qp * region decreases gradually with the decrease of the parameter , and it disappears completely at the quantum critical endpoint * * qce** where the boundaries between these phases emerge . below this * qce * , i.e. , for , there is a direct first - order phase transition between the * af * and * caf * phases , with a transition point ( classical value ) . in order to illustrate the nature of the phase transition , we also show , in inset fig . 2 , the behavior of the staggered magnetization ( order parameter ) as a function of the frustration parameter  for and . from curves such as those shown in fig . 2 we see that for there exists an intermediate region between the critical point at which for the * af * phase , characterizing a second - order transition , and the point at which the order parameter presents a discontinuity for the * caf * phase , characterizing a first - order transition . for , the order parameter of the * af * phase decreases monotonically with increase of the frustration parameter from , for , to zero for  . in the * caf * phase decreases from for to for , characterizing a direct first - order transition between the magnetically ordered * af * and * caf * phases located at the crossing point . we note that the definition of the order parameter  difer of factor when compared with calculations which use other methods ( i.e. , ) . therefore , in the limit of the not frustrated  square lattice  antiferromagnetic , solving the equations ( 12 ) and applying the corrections factor we found which is consistent with the numerical results obtained by various methods such as series expansion , quantum monte carlo simulation , and others , and can also be compared with experimental results for the knif , kmnf , and rbmnf compounds . plane for the quantum spin- model on a square lattice , where and . the dashed and solid lines corresponds the first- and second - order transitions lines , respectively . the black point represents the quantum critical endpoint ( * qce * ) . the notations indicated by * af * , * caf * and * qp * corresponds the antiferromagnetic , collinear antiferromagnetic and quantum paramagnetic phases , respectively . the dotted line correspond the classical solution . ] in summary , we have studied the effects of quantum fluctuations due to spatial  and frustration  parameter in the quantum spin- heisenberg model . using a variational method we calculated the sublattice magnetization for the * af * and * caf * phases . for values of the frustration contributes significantly to the existence of a disordered intermediate state ( * qp * ) between the two * af * and * caf * ordered phases , while for , we have a direct first - order transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . we have observed , by analyzing the order parameters of the * af * and * caf * phases , that the phase transitions are of second and first - order between the * af - qp * and * caf - qp * , respectively . the obtained phase diagram can be compared with recent results which used effective - field theory and coupled - cluster method , showing the same qualitative results predicting a paramagnetic region for small interlayer parameter ( i.e. , ) , and for this * qp * phase disappears by presenting a direct first - order transition between the * af * and * caf * phases . on the other hand , recent calculations of second order spin wave theory have indicated that the intermediate * qp * phase exists for all in accordance with results of exact diagonalization . we speculate that by using a more sophisticated method , for example , quantum monte carlo simulations and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , this disordered region should disappear for certain values of . r. f. bishop , p. h. y. li , r. darradi , j. schulenburg , and j. richter , phys . b * 78 * , 054412 ( 2008 ) ; r. f. bishop , p. h. y. li , r. darradi , j. schulenburg , j. richter , and c. e. campbell , j. phys . : condens . matter * 20 * , 415213 ( 2008 ) . see also , r. darradi , j. richter , j. schulenburg , r. f. bishop , and p. h. y. li , j. phys . : conference series * 145 * , 012049 ( 2009 ) . p. carretta , r. melzi , n. papinutto , and p. millet , phys . * 88 * , 047601 ( 2002 ) ; p. carretta , n. papinutto , c. b. azzoni , m. c. mozzati , e. pavarini , s. gonthier , and o. millet , phys . b . * 66 * , 094420 ( 2002 ) .", "summary": "the phase transition of the quantum spin- frustrated heisenberg antiferroferromagnet on an anisotropic square lattice is studied by using a variational treatment . the model is described by the heisenberg hamiltonian with two antiferromagnetic interactions : nearest -

{"article": "the entanglement entropy , as a tool to detect and classify quantum phase transitions , has been playing an important role in the last fifteen years ( see and references therein ) . in one dimension , where most of the critical quantum chains are conformal invariant , the entanglement entropy provides a powerful tool to detect , as well to calculate , the central charge of the underlying cft . for example , for quantum chains , the ground - state entanglement entropy of a subsystem formed by contiguous sites of an infinite system , with respect to the complementary subsystem has the leading behavior if the system is critical or , when the system is noncritical with correlation length . although there are plenty of proposals to measure this quantity in the lab the actual experiments were out of reach so far . strictly speaking the central charge of quantum spin chains has never been measured experimentally . recently other quantities , that are also dependent of the central charge has been proposed . among these proposals interesting measures that , from the numerical point of view , are also efficient in detecting the phase transitions as well as the universality class of critical behavior , are the shannon and rnyi mutual informations ( see also the related works ) . the rnyi mutual information ( the exact definition will be given in the next section ) has a parameter that recovers the shannon mutual information at the value . the results derived in indicate that the shannon and rnyi mutual informations of the ground state of quantum spin chains , when expressed in some special local basis , similarly as happens with the shannon and rnyi entanglement entropy , show a logarithmic behavior with the subsystem s size whose coefficient depends on the central charge . recently additional new results concerning the shannon and rnyi mutual information in quantum systems were obtained , see . there are also studies of the mutual information in classical two dimensional spin systems . it is worth mentioning that the shannon and rnyi mutual informations studied in the above papers , as will be defined in the next section , are basis dependent quantities . it is important to distinguish them from the more known basis independent quantity , namely , the von neumann mutual information . for recent developments on the calculation of the von neumann mutual information in thermal equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems see . most of the results regarding the shannon and the rnyi mutual information , except for the case of harmonic chains , are based on numerical analysis , especially for systems with central charge not equal to one . one of the main problems in a possible analytical derivation comes from the presence of a discontinuity at of the rnyi mutual information . this discontinuity prevents the use of the replica trick , which is normally a necessary step for the analytical derivation of the shannon mutual information . in this paper we will consider , for many different quantum chains , another version of the mutual information , which is also parametrized by a parameter that reduces at to the shannon mutual information . the motivation for our calculations is two fold . firstly this definition is more appropriate from the point of view of a measure of shared information among parts of a system , since it has the expected properties . this will be discussed in the appendix . secondly , this quantity does not show any discontinuity at , so it might be a good starting point for the analytical calculation of the shannon mutual information with some sort of analytical continuation of the parameter . from now on we will call this new quantity generalized mutual information . having the above motivations in mind we firstly calculated numerically ( using exact diagonalization ) the generalized mutual information for several critical quantum spin chains . we considered models with symmetries like the -state potts modes for and , the z(4 ) ashkin - teller model and the parafermionic models with . we then calculated the generalized mutual information for quantum critical harmonic chains ( discrete version of klein - gordon field theory ) and also for quantum spin chains with symmetry like the xxz and the spin-1 fateev - zamolodchikov quantum chains . the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we will present the essential definitions of the shannon and rnyi mutual informations as well as generalized mutual information . in section three we will present the numerical results of the generalized mutual information for many different critical quantum spin chains . finally in the last section we present our conclusions . consider the normalized ground state eigenfunction of a quantum spin chain hamiltonian , expressed in a particular local basis , where are the eigenvalues of some local operators defined on the lattice sites . the rnyi entropy is defined as where is the probability of finding the system in the particular configuration given by . the limit gives us the shannon entropy . since we are considering only local basis it is always possible to decompose the configurations as a combination of the configurations inside and outside of the subregions as . one can define the marginal probabilities as and . in a previous paper we studied the naive definition of the rnyi mutual information : from now on instead of using we will use just . the known results of the rnyi mutual informations of quantum critical chains are obtained by using the definition  . for special basis , usually the ones where part of the hamiltonian is diagonal ( see ) , the definition  for the rnyi mutual information gives us a logarithmic behavior with the subsystem size , for arbitrary values of . however , as observed numerically for several quantum chains ( see ) , it shows a discontinuity at , that forbids the use of large- analysis to obtain the most interesting case where , namely the standard shannon mutual information . although the definition  has its own uses it is not the one which normally has been considered in information sciences . for example for is not necessarily a positive function , a property that we naturally expect to be hold for the mutual informations . in this paper we consider a definition that is common in information sciences . the generalized mutual information with the desired properties , as a measure of shared information ( see appendix ) , is defined as : where and , as before , are the probabilities that the subsystems are independently in the configurations and that forms the configuration that occurs with probability . hereafter will represent the size of the whole system and and the sizes of the subsystems . with this new notation one can write as . this definition of the generalized mutual information comes from the natural extension of the relative entropy to the rnyi case and measures the distance of the full distribution from the product of two independent distributions . in the limit one easily recovers the shannon mutual information , where is the standard shannon entropy . one of the important properties of , that is not shared by , is its nondecreasing behavior as a function of ( see appendix ) . our calculations for a set of distinct quantum spin chains will be done numerically , since up to our knowledge an analytical method to consider these quantum chains is still missing . in this section we will numerically calculate the ground - state generalized mutual information of two series of critical quantum spin chains with slightly different structure . in the first part we will calculate the generalized mutual information for systems with discrete symmetries such as the -state potts models with and , the ashkin - teller model and the parafermionic -quantum spin chain for the values of and . in the second part we will calculate the generalized mutual information for systems with symmetry such as the klein - gordon field theory , the xxz model and the fateev - zamolodchikov model with different values of their anisotropy parameters . in this subsection we will study the generalized mutual information of the ground state of different critical spin chains with discrete symmetries . the results we present were obtained by expressing the ground - state wavefunction in two specific basis where the systems show some universal properties . of the sites periodic ising quantum chain , as a function of . the ground - state wavefunction is in the basis where the matrices are diagonal ( basis).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] our results show that the q - state potts model and the ashkin - teller model share a similar behavior . for this reason we discuss them together . the critical -state potts model in a periodic lattice is defined by the hamiltonian where and are matrices satisfying the following algebra : ===0 ].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] here we summarize the results for the -state potts and ashkin - teller quantum chains : 1 . the results in general depend on the basis we choose to express the ground - state wavefunction . 2 . the generalized mutual information follows  in the and basis but with different coefficients for different basis . to illustrate the logarithmic behavior we show in fig . 1 and fig . 2 the mutual information for the ising model  with sites and ground - state eigenfunctions in the and basis , respectively . we see , from these figures , that for subsystem sizes we have the logarithmic behavior given by  up to in the -basis and in the -basis . as we can see our results does not exclude the existence of some relevant -dependent terms in  for large values of . + are diagonal . the lattice sizes of the models are shown in the figure , as well as the subsystems sizes used to estimate .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] 3 . the coefficient of the logarithm in  is a continuous monotonically non - decreasing function of and it follows the following formula in the basis : where is the central charge and seems to be a continuous universal function independent of the model , as we can see in fig . 3 . in the case of the ashkin - teller model the results start to deviate around from the ones obtained for the potts models . as we can see in fig . 3 , the deviation point is dependent on the anisotropy parameter of the model . 4 . in the case of the basis , as one can see in fig . 4 , equation  is still valid for values of up to . however the function is distinct from the one obtained in the basis . as shown in fig . 4 , up to the form of the function seems to be also independent of the model . this figure also shows that the ashkin - teller model has stronger deviations in this basis , as compared with the results obtained in the basis . in order to better see the difference of the coefficients in the and basis , we present in fig . 5 the data of figs . 3 and 4 for the and 4 state potts models . + of figs . 3 and 4 for the and 4-state potts model are shown in the same figure , for comparison.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] 5 . the coefficient of the logarithm in the basis always goes to zero as , differently from the basis where it approaches to a non - trivial number . this simply means that probably in the continuum limit all the probabilities in the basis are positive but in the basis some of them are zero . for the definition of the case see the appendix . our numerical results indicate that is a continuous function of around . this means that should be a continuous function with respect to and so it is a better candidate to be used in techniques exploring the analytical continuation of the value , as happens for example in the replica trick . however , the appropriate technique that may be used is still unclear to us . it is important to mention that the results obtained for the ratio in this section ( fig . 3 ) and in the subsequent ones ( figs . 8 , 9 , 11 and 13 ) are based on the linear fit with the ].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] in this section we consider the generalized mutual information of critical chains having a continuous symmetry . we studied a set of coupled harmonic oscillators which gives a discrete version of klein - gordon field theory as well as the spin-1/2 xxz and the spin-1 fateev - zamolodchikov quantum chains . the last two models are interesting since , like the ashkin - teller model , they have an anisotropy that gives us a critical line of continuously varying critical exponents but with a fixed central charge . are diagonal . the lattice sizes of the models , as well as the subsystems sizes used to estimate are shown.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] in this subsection we will first consider the generalized mutual information of the ground state of a system of generic coupled harmonic oscillators . then at the very end we will confine ourselves to the simple case where we have only the nonzero couplings at the next - nearest sites , that in the continuum limit gives us the klein - gordon field theory . consider the hamiltonian of -coupled harmonic oscillators , with coordinates and conjugated momenta : the ground state of the above hamiltonian has the following form for the general hamiltonian  , one can calculate the two point correlators and using the matrix defined in  . the squared root of this matrix , as well as its inverse , can be split up up into coordinates of the subsystems ( size ) and ( size ) , i. e. , here we chose the couplings so that we always keep the equalities and . the spectra of the matrix , can be used to calculate the rnyi entanglement entropy ( see and references therein ) as . \\nonumber\\ ] ] in this formulation we only need the correlators inside the region . note that the above quantity is basis independent and is considered as an usual measure of the quantum entanglement . here we need to introduce this quantity just for later use . to calculate the generalized mutual information for a system of coupled harmonic oscillators one first needs to fix the basis . here we work in the position coordinate basis , however all the results are valid also in the momentum basis . one should notice that the same is not true if one works in a generic basis obtained through canonical transformations from the position or momentum basis . in order to calculate first we find and as where and . since takes continuum values one needs to consider the integral version of the equation  as follows : where . plugging eqs .  ,   in the equation  and performing the gaussian integral one can derive the generalized mutual information the following determinant formulas allow us to write where there is an important remark that we should mention : in principle eq .  makes sense only if is a symmetric positive definite matrix . if we start with a symmetric positive definite matrix this is already warrantied for but for one needs to check its validity . this will be an important point when we study the short - range coupled harmonic oscillators . finally one can write where is the only dependent part . we notice here that by changing to we just change the sign of the second term , i. e. , . ) , , as a function of for periodic quantum harmonic chain with sites.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] when the second term vanishes and we recover the result of for massless klein - gordon theory the above result in one dimension gives , as a consequence the well known result for the rnyi entanglement entropy , where the dots are the subleading terms . our numerical analyses indicate that for short - range quantum harmonic oscillators the matrix is symmetric positive definite up to just is not exactly equal to , however , by increasing the lattice size it approaches the value . we conjecture that is exact in the thermodynamic limit . ] . the numerical results show that for the values the equation  is a very good approximation , as we can see for example in fig . the coefficient of the logarithmic term in  is obtained from the fitting of the model with sites is shown in fig . 11 and in the range surprisingly it follows the simple formula : this is the red line in fig . 11 . at we expect zero mutual information for our system , this means that based on the symmetry the coefficient for should be . finally one can conclude that for integer values of the coefficient of the logarithm is in the equation  . the lattice size and the coefficients were estimated by using the subsystem sizes $ ] . the red line is given by eq . .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] the hamiltonian of the xxz chain is defined as where , and are spin- pauli matrices and is an anisotropy . the model is critical and conformal invariant for with a constant central charge , giving us a good example to test the universality of our results with respect to the change of the anisotropy . the long - distance critical fluctuations are ruled by a cft with central charge described by a compactified boson whose action is given by where the compactification radius depends upon the values of , namely : as it is shown in fig . 12 , in the basis , the generalized mutual information shows the logarithmic behavior given in  only for . this can be simply understood based on what we observed for the chain of harmonic oscillators . one can look to the klein - gordon field theory as a non - compactified version of the action  . since we showed that in that case the generalized mutual information is not defined beyond we expect the same behavior also in the compactified version . note that in our numerical calculations one can actually derive spurious big numbers for the generalized mutual information even for , but we expect all of them go to infinity in the thermodynamic limit . this behavior seems to be independent of the anisotropy parameter . the coefficient of the logarithm in  for is again given by  , as we can see in fig . 13 , with a function which fits to the results of the harmonic chain perfectly . we also considered the results in the case where the ground state wavefunction is expressed in the basis and , except around , the equation  is not a good approximation . of the periodic xxz quantum chain with anisotropy , as a function of . the ground - state wavefunction is in the basis where the matrices are diagonal ( basis ) . the results are for lattice sizes and and give an idea of the finite - size corrections.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] the second -symmetric model we considered is the spin-1 fateev - zamolodchikov quantum chain whose hamiltonian is given by where are spin-1 matrices , and . the model is antiferromagnetic for and ferromagnetic for . it has a line of critical points  with a quite distinct behavior in the antiferromagnetic  and ferromagnetic  cases . the antiferromagnetic version of the model is governed by a cft with central charge while the ferromagnetic one is ruled by a cft . we calculated in both critical regimes where and , and for different values of the anisotropy . we found a very similar pattern as that of the xxz quantum chain , as can be seen in fig . 13 the equation  is valid for values of and the coefficient of the logarithm follows  with a function which is quite similar to the one we found for the quantum harmonic oscillators and the xxz chain . this shows an interesting universal pattern for critical chains with continuous symmetry . of the coefficient of the logarithm in equation  with the central charge for the xxz and for the spin-1 fateev - zamolodchikov quantum chains ( f - z ) . the xxz ( fateev - zamolodchikov ) ground - state wavefunction are in the  basis . the results for the xxz are for the anisotropies and in the case of the fateev - zamolodchikov model their are for the couplings . the lattice sizes of the models are shown and the coefficients were estimated by using the subsystem sizes .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] in this paper we calculated the generalized mutual information , as defined in  , for quantum chains describing the dynamics of quantum systems with continuous or discrete degrees of freedom . most of our analysis was purely numerical due to the absence , at the moment , of suitable analytical methods to treat this problem . we considered several integrable quantum spin chains . these quantum chains either have a symmetry ( like the -state potts model with and 4 , the ashkin - teller model , and the -parafermionic model with and 8) or a symmetry ( xxz quantum chain and the spin-1 fateev - zamolodchikov model ) . we also considered the discrete version of the klein - gordon field theory given by a set of coupled harmonic oscillators . in this case we have a continuum hilbert space . we observed that by expressing the ground - state wavefunctions in general basis the obtained results are distinct . however , similarly as happens for the quantity given in  ( see ) , our results on some special basis reveal some general features . these basis are the ones where the or operators are diagonal , for the models with symmetry or the ones where or are diagonal for the models with symmetry . in a continuum field theory description of these quantum chains these basis are expected to be associated to the boundaries that do not destroy the conformal invariance of the bulk underlying euclidean conformal field theory , and for this reason we call them conformal basis . our results indicate that in these special basis the mutual information has the same kind of leading behavior with the subsystem size as we have in the rnyi entanglement entropy , namely , with a function , with . differently from the rnyi entanglement entropy where the equivalent function is universal ( for any model and any basis ) in the case of our results indicate that the function depends on the special basis chosen to express the ground - state eigenfunction of the particular model . for the set of -symmetric models we considered the function , for , although different for the and basis are similar as the ones of the -state potts chain  and the parafermionic quantum chains  . in the case of the ashkin - teller model our results indicate that , for , also depends on the anisotropy of the model . on the other hand the models with continuum symmetry showed a similar behavior only for . for we have strong evidences that most probably the generalized mutual information is not defined . it is quite interesting that in these cases one can understand most of the results by just studying simple short - range coupled harmonic oscillators . in order to conclude we should mention that an analytical approach for the shannon entropy or the shannon mutual information ( or in  and  ) is a theoretical challenge . the analytical methods to treat this kind of problem normally use some sort of analytical continuation , in the parameter , like the usual replica trick . the results we present showing the continuity of around , differently from what happens with , indicate that is probably more appropriate for an analytical treatment . acknowledgments this work was supported in part by fapesp and cnpq ( brazilian agencies ) . we thank j. a. hoyos , r. pereira and v. pasquier for useful discussions . in this appendix we review the definitions of the relative entropy and its generalization : the rnyi divergence . the relative entropy is defined as the expectation of the difference between the logarithm of the two distribution of probabilities and , from the point of view of the distribution , i. e. , it can be considered as a measure of the difference between the two distributions and . although it is not a symmetric quantity it helps us to define the mutual information of the subsets ans of the system as follows in words , the mutual information between two parts of a system is just the relative entropy between the distribution probability for the whole system and the product of the probability distributions of the different parts . it tells how much the different parts are correlated . the natural generalization of the relative entropy is the rnyi divergence and can be defined ( see for example ) , as it has the following properties : for we have and if then we have . the especial case gives the usual relative entropy . we also define the case by : it is worth mentioning that using the above definition is not zero except when for all s for which also holds . comparing  with  and  the natural definition of the generalized mutual information is the above definition is different from , as given by  , and has been frequently used in different areas of information science . 99 l. amico , r . fazio , a. osterloh , and v. vedral , rev . phys . * 80 * , 517 ( 2008 ) ; k. modi , a. brodutch , h. cable , t. paterek , and v. vedral , rev . * 84 * , 1655 ( 2012 ) ; u. schollwck , rev . phys . * 77 * , 259 ( 2005 ) p. calabrese , j. cardy , j. phys . a 42:504005 ( 2009 ) j. cardy , phys . lett . * 106 * , 150404 ( 2011 ) . d. a. abanin and e. demler , phys . . lett . * 109 * , 020504 ( 2012 ) . a. j. daley , h. pichler , j. schachenmayer , and p. zoller , phys . rev . lett . * 109*,020505 ( 2012 ) . f. c. alcaraz , m. a. rajabpour , phys . * 111 * , 017201 ( 2013 ) j -

{"article": "it has been known for a long time that owing to planar property and mutual focussing , colliding plane waves ( cpw ) result in spacelike singularities . these singularities are somewhat weakened when the waves are endowed with a relative cross polarization prior to the collision . a solution given by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos ( cx ) , however constitutes an example contrasting this category , namely , it possesses a cauchy horizon ( ch ) instead of a spacelike singularity . naturally , this solution initiated a literature devoted entirely on the quest of stability of horizons formed hitherto . ch formed in spacetimes of cpw was shown by yurtsever to be unstable against plane - symmetric perturbations . a linear perturbation analysis by cx reveals also an analogues result . any such perturbation applied to a cpw spacetime will turn the ch into an essential singularity . a second factor that proved effective in weakening the strength of a singularity in cpw is the electromagnetic ( em ) field itself . in other words , the degree of divergence in the curvature scalars of colliding pure gravitational waves turn out to be stronger than the case when em field is coupled to gravity . in particular , collision of pure em waves must have a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned . such an interesting solution was given by bell and szekeres ( bs ) which describes the collision of two linearly polarized step em waves . the singularity ( in fact a ch ) formed in the interaction region of the bs solution was shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation . on the null boundaries , however it possesses esential curvature singularities which can not be removed by any means . since cross polarization and em field both play roles in the nature of resulting singularity it is worthwhile to purse these features together . this invokes a cross polarized version of the bs ( cpbs ) solution which was found long time ago . this metric had the nice feature that the weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region . cross polarization , however , does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries . in this paper we choose cpbs solution as a test ground , instead of bs , with various added test fields to justify the validity of a ch stability conjecture proposed previously by helliwell and konkowski ( hk ) . unlike the tedious perturbation analysis of both cx and yurtsever the conjecture seems to be much economical in reaching a direct conclusion about the stability of a ch . this is our main motivation for considering the problem anew , for the case of untested solutions in cpw . in this paper we look at the spacetimes : a ) single plane wave with added colliding test fields and b ) colliding plane waves having non - singular interaction regions with test field added , fig.1 illustrates these cases . the terminology of singularities should be follwed from the classification presented by ellis and schmidt . singularities in maximal four dimensional spacetimes can be divided into three basic types : quasiregular ( qr ) , scalar curvature ( sc ) and non - scalar curvature ( nsc ) . the ch stability conjecture due to hk is defined as follows . for all maximally extended spacetimes with ch , the backreaction due to a field ( whose test stress - energy tensor is ) will affect the horizon in one of the following manners . , and any null dust density are finite , and if the stress energy tensor in all parallel propagated orthonormal ( ppon ) frames is finite , then the ch remains non - singular . b)if , and any null dust density are finite , but diverges in some ppon frames , then an nsc singularity will be formed at the ch . c)if , and any null dust density diverges , then an sc singularity will be formed at the ch . expressed otherwise , the conjecture suggests to put a test field into the background geometry and study the reaction it will experience . if certain scalars diverge then in an exact back - reaction solution the field will respond with an infinite strength to the geometry ( i.e action versus reaction ) . such an infinite back - reaction will render a ch unstable and convert it into a scalar singularity . + the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , we review the cpbs solution and the correct nature of the singularity structure is presented in appendix a. section iii , deals with geodesics and test em and scalar field analyses . in section iv , we present an exact back reaction calculation for the collision of cross polarized em field coupled with scalar field . the derivation of weyl and maxwell scalars are given in appendix b. the insertion of test null dusts to the background cpbs spacetime and its exact back reaction solution is studied in section v. appendix c is devoted for the properties of this solution . the paper is concluded with a discussion in section vi . the metric that describes collision of em waves with the cross polarization was found to be + in this representation of the metric our notations are + in which is a constant measuring the second polarization , are constant of energy and stand for the usual null coordinates . it can be seen easily that for the metric reduces to bs . unlike the bs metric , however , this is conformally non - flat for , where the conformal curvature is generated by the cross polarization . as a matter of fact this solution is a minimal extension of the bs metric . a completely different generalization of the bs solution with second polarization was given by cx . their solution , however , employs an ehlers transformation and involves two essential parameters which is therefore different from ours . both solutions form ch in the interaction region . our result drown out in this paper , namely , that the horizon is unstable against added sources can also be shown to apply to the cx metric as well . as it was shown before the interaction region of the above metric is of type - d without scalar curvature singularities . we wish to check now the possible singularities of metric ( 1 ) . the single component of the weyl scalar suffices to serve our purpose . we find that the real part of the weyl scalar is given by \\ ] ] where we have used the abbreviations as we obtain which reduces to the singularity form of the bs spacetime given by . we see that the same singularity remains unaffected by the introduction of the cross polarization . a similar calculation for gives the symmetrical singular hypersurface sitting on . now in order to explore the true nature of the singularity we concentrate our account on the incoming region ii . the metric in this region is expressed in the form \\ ] ] where we observe that for , is a bounded positive definite function which suggests that no additional singularities arise except the one occuring already in the bs case , namely at . to justify this we have calculated all riemann components in local and ppon frames ( see appendix a ) . it is found that all riemann tensor components vanish as . in the ppon frame , however , they are all finite and according to the classification scheme of ellis and schmidt such a singularity is called a quasiregular ( qr ) singularity . this is said to be the mildest type among all types of singularities . to check whether the qr is stable or not we consider generic test fields added to such a background geometry and study the effects . this we will do in the follwing sections . we are interested in the stability of qr singularities that are developed at in region ii and in region iii . to investigate their stability we will express geodesics and behaviour of test em and scalar fields by calculating stress - energy tensor in local and ppon frames . + our discussion on geodesics will be restricted in region ii only . we shall consider the geodesics that originate at the wave front and move toward the quasiregular singularity . solution of geodesics equations in region ii can be obtained by geodesics lagrangian method and using as a parameter . the results are }{a}\\tan(au ) + }\\leftu}{4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -

inertial frames . to test the stability of quasiregular singularity , let us consider a test em field whose vector potential is choosen appropriately as in to be with arbitrary functions and . the only nonzero energy -

reaction solution . in the next section we present an explicit example that represents cross - polarized em field coupled with scalar field . in the former sections , we applied hk stability conjecture to test the stability of qr singularities in the incoming region of cpbs spacetime . according to the conjecture these mild singularities are unstable . in order to see the validity of the conjecture we introduce this new solution . + let the metric be ; \\ ] ] the new solution is obtained from the electrovacuum solution . the ems solution is generated in the following manner . the lagrangian density of the system is defined by \\ ] ] which correctly generate all ems field equations from a variational principle . here is the scalar field and we define the em potential one -

momentum tensor for two oppositely moving null dusts can be chosen as where and are the finite energy densities of the dusts . the null propagation directions and are with we observe from ( 1 ) that which is finite for . the components of energy - momentum tensors in ppon frames are proportional to the expression ( 38 ) . this proportionality makes all the components of energy - momentum tensors finite . in the limit as which reduces our line element to the bs this expression diverges on the horizon . trace of the energy - momentum is obviously zero therefore we must extract information from the scalar . one obtains , the projection on , however is not as promising as the case . consider the reduced metric a similar analysis with the null vectors with yields the scalar from the metric ( 1 ) we see that which diverges on the horizon . the scalar constructed from the test dusts therefore diverges . the ppon components of the energy momentum tensors are also calculated and it is found that all of the components are proportional to the expression ( 42 ) . this indicates that the components of energy - momentum tensor diverges as the singularity is approached . when we consider the hk stability conjecture an exact back reaction solution must give a singular solution . we present now an exact back reaction solution of two colliding null shells in the interaction region of the cpbs spacetime . + * b ) * the metric given by where with positive constants was considered by wang to represent collision of two null shells ( or impulsive dusts ) . the interaction region is transformable to the de sitter cosmological spacetime . in other words the tail of two crossing null shells is energetically equivalent to the de sitter space . it can be shown also that the choice of the conformal factor , with positive constants becomes isomorphic to the anti - de sitter space . + the combined metric of cpbs and colliding shells can be represented by this amounts to the substitutions where correspond to the metric functions of the cpbs solution . under this substitutions the scale invariant weyl scalars remain invariant ( or at most multiplied by a conformal factor ) because is the combination that arise in those scalars . the scalar curvature , however , which was zero in the case of cpbs now arises as nonzero and becomes divergent as we approach the horizon . appendix c gives the scalar quantities and . thus the exact back reaction solution is a singular one as predicted by the conjecture . it is further seen that choosing , which removes one of the shells leaves us with a single shell propagating in the - direction . from the scalars we see that even a single shell gives rise to a divergent back reaction by the spacetime . the horizon , in effect , is unstable and transforms into a singularity in the presence of two colliding , or even a single propagating null shell . let us note as an alternative interpretation that the metric ( 43 ) may be considered as a colliding em waves in a de sitter background . collision of em waves creates an unstable horizon in the de sitter space which is otherwise regular for and . in this paper we have analysed the stability of qr singularities in the cpbs spacetime . three types of test fields are used to probe the stability . first we have applied test em field to the background cpbs spacetime . from the analyses we observed that the qr singularity in the incoming region becomes unstable according to the conjecture , and it is transformed into nsc singularity . this is the prediction of the conjecture . however , the exact back - reaction solution shoes that beside the true singularities on the null boundaries and . there are quasiregular singularities in the incoming regions . the interior of interaction region is singularity free and the hypersurface is a killing - cauchy horizon . as it was pointed out by hk in the case of colliding em step waves , conjecture fails to predict the correct nature of the singularity in the interaction region . we have also discovered the same behaviour for the cross polarized version of colliding em step waves . the addition of cross polarization does not alter the existing property . + secondly we have applied test scalar field to the background cpbs spacetime . the effect of scalar field on the qr singularity is stronger than the effect of em test field case . we have obtained that the qr singularity is unstable and transformes into a scs . to check the validity of the conjecture , we have constructed a new solution constituting an exact back reaction solution to the test scalar field in the cpbs spacetime . the solution represents the collision of cross polarized em field coupled to a scalar field . an examination of weyl and maxwell scalars shows that and diverge as the singularity is approached and unlike the test em field case the conjecture predicts the nature of singularity formed correctly . + finally , we have introduced test null dusts into the interaction region of cpbs spacetime . the conjecture predicts that the ch are unstable and transforms into scs . this result is compared with the exact back - reaction solution and observed that the conjecture works . to determine the type of singularity in the incoming region of cpbs spacetime , the riemann tensor in local and in ppon frame must be evaluated . non - zero riemann tensors in local coordinates are found as follows . \\nonumber \\\\ -r {uyuy}&= & e^{-u - v } \\left \\nonumber \\\\ r {uxuy}&= & e^{-u}\\left \\ ] ] where \\nonumber \\\\ i m \\psi 4&=&-{2}\\left(w {uu } -u uw u + m uw u -v^2 u coshw sinhw \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\phi {22}&=&{4}\\left(2u {uu}-u^2 u -

zero components of the riemann tensors are : in the limit of , we have the following results which are all finite . this indicates that the apparent singularity in region ii ( one of the incoming region ) is a quasiregular singularity . in order to calculate the weyl and maxwell scalars we make use of the cx line element where is given in equation ( 4 ) and we have chosen , such that the new coordinates are related to by the weyl and maxwell scalars are found as \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ \\psi 0&=&-e^{\\gamma -

{"article": "in adaptive control and recursive parameter estimation one often needs to adjust recursively an estimate of a vector , which comprises constant but unknown parameters , using measurements of a quantity here is a vector of known data , often called the regressor , and is a measurement error signal . the goal of tuning is to keep both the estimation error and the parameter error as small as possible . there are several popular methods for dealing with the problem above , for instance least - squares . maybe the most straightforward involve minimizing the prediction error via gradient - type algorithms of the form : where is a constant , symmetric , positive - definite gain matrix . let us define and analyze differential equations and , which under the assumption that is identically zero read : the nonnegative function has time derivative hence inspection of the equation above reveals that is limited in time , thus , and also that the error ( norms are taken on the interval where all signals are defined ) . these are the main properties an algorithm needs in order to be considered a suitable candidate for the role of a tuner in an adaptive control system . often or something similar is also a desirable property . to obtain the latter , normalized algorithms can be used ;

{"article": "the construction of background field formalism for n=2 super - yang - mills theory ( sym ) in projective hyperspace  is an open problem . such a formalism is desirable for any ( non-)supersymmetric theory as it simplifies ( loop ) calculations and even intermediate steps respect gauge covariance . a major obstacle in solving this problem for the n=2 case seems to be the lack of knowledge relating the gauge connections to the tropical hyperfield , which describes the sym multiplet for all practical purposes . we note that the closely related n=2 harmonic superspace  does nt encounter this issue as the hyperfield , describing the sym multiplet is itself a connection , . in fact , background field formalism in harmonic superspace has quite a straightforward construction . although the construction has some subtleties , it has been refined in a series of papers along with relevant calculations . in this paper , we solve the problem of constructing the background field formalism in projective superspace without the need for knowing the connections explicitly in terms of . this is possible by choosing the background fields to be in a ` real ' representation  and the quantum fields to be in the ` analytic ' representation  . this is reminiscent of the quantum - chiral but background - real representation used in n=1 superspace . what this does is make the effective action independent of and dependent on background fields ( like ) with ` dimension ' greater than ( since the lowest one is a spinor ) . non - existence of -dimension background fields ( like ) is a crucial requirement for the non - renormalization theorems to hold as discussed in . this directly leads to a proof of finiteness beyond 1-loop . ( a different approach for proof of finiteness has been discussed in . ) the coupling of quantum fields to background fields comes through the former s projective constraint alone , which simplifies the vertex structure a lot . the calculations are also simplified at 1-hoop as most -integrals turn out to be trivial since the background fields have trivial -dependence . this means that the -integration effectively vanishes from the effective action and as expected from the supergraph rules , only one -integration survives at the end of the calculations . we also work in fermi - feynman gauge so there are no ir issues to worry about while evaluating the super - feynman graphs . another important aspect is the ghost structure of the theory in this background gauge . apart from the expected faddeev - popov ( fermionic ) and nielsen - kallosh ( bosonic ) ghosts , we require two more extra ghosts , namely real bosonic and complex fermionic . this is in contrast to n=1 sym but very similar to the harmonic treatment of n=2 theory . heuristically , we can even see that such a field content would give a vanishing -function for n=4 . moreover , we will see that the loop contributions of and extra ghosts have spurious divergences arising due to multiple s . these are very similar to the ` coinciding harmonic ' singularities in the case , which manifest themselves at 1-loop level via the subtleties regarding regularization of similar looking determinants . however , in case , we do not encounter such striking similarities . only the divergences turn out to be similar , leading to a cancellation between the vector hyperfield s contribution and that of the extra ghosts . the finite pieces in the effective action are contributed by these extra ghosts only . this section is mostly built on the ordinary projective superspace construction of sym detailed in . we review it briefly below for the sake of continuity . we also use the 6d notation to simplify some useful identities involving background covariant derivatives and moreover , the results carry over to n=1 6d sym in a trivial manner with this notation . the projective hyperspace comprises of usual spacetime coordinates  , four fermionic ones  and a complex coordinate on cp  . the full n=2 superspace requires four more fermionic coordinates  in addition to these projective ones . the super - covariant derivatives corresponding to these extra s define a projective hyperfield  via the constraint . the algebra of the covariant derivatives will be given below but we note here that in the ` real ' representation ( called ` reflective ' in and the one we use extensively in this paper ) the s are -dependent . their anti - commutation relation at different s is all that we need here : the scalar hypermultiplet is described by an ` arctic ' hyperfield  that contains only non - negative powers of and the vector hypermultiplet by a ` tropical ' , which contains all powers of . to construct the relevant actions , the integration over this internal coordinate is defined to be the usual contour integration , with the contour being a circle around the origin ( for our purposes in this paper ) . so , the projective measure simply reads : ( with the usual factor of being suppressed ) . now , we are ready to delve into the details of the background field formalism . the gauge covariant derivatives , , describing n=2 sym satisfy the following ( anti- ) commutation relations ( written in 6d notation ) : =- {}w a^{}\\,,\\\\ \\{ {a},w b^{}\\}={{\\cal d}} {ab} {}^{}-}}{2}c {ab}f {}^{}\\,,\\\\ =f ^{}\\,,\\\\ = {}\\,,\\quad =0\\ , , \\ ] ] where the su(2 ) index , and are the field strengths , and are the triplet of auxiliary scalars . the 4d scalar chiral field strength , is related to the spinor field strength via appropriate spinor derivatives . we solve the commutation relation for by writing , where is an unconstrained complex hyperfield . we can do a background splitting of ( similar to n=1 superspace ) such that with being the background covariant derivative . we can now choose ` real ' representation for the background derivatives independently such that . this simplifies the -dependence of the connections : since these connections have simple -dependence , the -integrals in the effective action can be trivially done . moreover , the quantum part of the full covariant derivatives then can be chosen to be in ` analytic ' representation , , and . the projective ( analytic ) constraint on hyperfields ` lifts ' to so we can now define a background projective hyperfield as such that . then , the scalar hypermultiplet s action reads : the vector hyperfield s action looks the same as in the ordinary case ; the difference being that the appearing below is only the quantum piece and is background projective : we know from that this action should give an expression for and hence the ` analytic ' representation for quantum hyperfields is a consistent choice . the background dependence of comes through the projective constraint and the background covariant derivatives only . the following identities will be useful in showing that and deriving other results in the following sections : ^4\\,,\\\\ {1}^4 {2}^4=\\left {2}^4\\,,\\ ] ] where is the gauge - covariant dalembertian and . as the quantum connections do not appear explicitly in the calculations , we will drop the usage of curly fonts to denote the background fields ( as has been done above ) and also the subscript ` ' on from now on . the quantization procedure in the background gauge proceeds similar to the ordinary case . the ordinary derivatives are now background - covariant derivatives so gets replaced by ( or ) everywhere . moreover , we need extra ghosts for the theory to be consistent in this formalism as we elaborate further in the following subsections . the scalar hypermultiplet is background projective but the structure of its action is still the same as in the ordinary case . that means the kinetic operator appearing in the equations of motion is , , still holds . so the derivation of the propagator performed in goes through after employing these changes : and : the gauge -

kallosh ( nk ) ghost to account for the resulting jacobian . this means the 1-loop contribution for n=2 sym coupled to matter simplifies to : for n=4 , the scalar hypermultiplet is in adjoint representation and its contribution will cancel the joint fp and nk ghosts contributions . the remaining two terms have spurious divergences due to multiple s but their joint contribution has to be finite , which will turn out to be the case as we develop this section further . to incorporate the effect of fields directly in the path integral , we choose to introduce a real scalar and a complex fermion as follows : where so the background field requires 3 fermionic ghosts and 2 bosonic ghosts and the full quantum action for n=2 sym coupled to matter reads : +s {fp}(v , b , c)+s {nk}(v , e)+s {xr}(v , x , r)+s {}(v,).\\ ] ] the fp and nk ghosts are background projective hyperfields . the actions for these ghosts look the same as those in the case of non - background gauge . the action for fp ghosts is given in equation  and that for nk ghost is similar to the scalar hypermultiplet s action . that means their propagators are straightforward generalizations and read now , we focus on the new ingredient of the background field formalism : the extra ghosts . in the same vein as the vector hypermultiplet , we can simplify the actions of these ghosts . let us just concentrate on the scalar ghost action as the fermionic ghost can be treated similarly : x 2\\\\ = & \\,-}}{4}dx d^4dy {1,2}\\,x 1\\leftx 2\\\\ = & \\,-}}{4}dx d^4dy {1,2}\\,x 1\\leftx 2\\,.\\ ] ] the propagator can then be derived in a similar way as the vector propagator with arbitrary . lets add a source term to the action for x ghost : x 2+{}dx\\,d^8\\,dy 2\\,j 2x 2\\nonumber\\\\ = & -}}{4}dx\\,d^4\\,dy {1,2}\\,x 1{\\left(})}{y {12}^2}{\\right)}{}x 2+{}dx\\,d^4\\,dy 2\\,{{\\cal j}} 2x 2\\,.\\ ] ] the equation of motion for now reads adopting an ansatz for ( similar to what was done for before ) , {{2}{}^2}2{{\\cal j}} 0\\,,\\ ] ] we find that and satisfy  . collecting all the results , the action reduces to which leads to the required propagator the propagator for the fermionic ghost has a similar expression . given this new construction of the background field formalism for sym , we can now employ it to calculate contributions to the effective action coming from different hypermultiplets . the general rules for constructing diagrams in the background field formalism are similar to the ordinary case discussed in . however , as expected in this formalism , the quantum propagators form the internal lines of the loops and the external lines correspond to the background fields . the and operators in the propagators need to be expanded around ( the connection - independent part of ) , which will generate the vertices with the vector connection and background fields . for the extra ghosts , we can further simplify the nave rules by noticing that the vertices have -factor and the propagator will generate such a factor in the numerator due to the presence of . thus , we can remove them from the very start and work with the revised propagator and vertex for the purpose of calculating diagrams . let us now collect all the relevant feynman rules below . {\\left(}{}- 0{\\right)}\\ ] ] ] scalar + + + + + + the one - loop contribution from the scalar hypermultiplet to the effective action can not be written in a fully gauge covariant form with a projective measure . thus , the diagrammatic calculation required to get this contribution ( which includes the uv - divergent piece too ) is not accessible via the formalism constructed here . we note that such an issue appears in the n=1 background formalism too when the scalar multiplets in complex representation are considered . the calculations can not be performed covariantly and explicit gauge fields appear in addition to the connections . ] vector + + + + + + the contribution to one - loop n - point diagrams from vector hypermultiplet running in the loop would be given by the following : where the numerical subscript on denotes the external momenta dependence . as usual , to kill the extra -function , at least four should be available from the vertices and so . the first non - vanishing contribution is from the 4-point diagram : too many s lead to spurious singularity , similar to ` coinciding harmonic ' singularities in . these will cancel when we take into account the ghosts . ] extra ghosts + + + + + + + + + + + + their combined contribution to one - loop n - point diagrams reads : \\nonumber\\\\ & { \\left(}w^(1) {,}+ ... {\\right)} ... \\, {n}^4^8( {n1 } ) )}{y {nb}}{k n^2}w^(n ) {,}+ ... {\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\sim&-d^4kd^4 ndy {1a, ... ,1b} {1b}^4^8( {n1})-1+y {1a}(y {1a,2b}){\\right)}}{y {1a}}{k 1 ^ 2}\\nonumber\\\\ & { \\left(}w^(1 ) {,}+ ... {\\right)} ... \\,-1+y {na}(y {nb,1b}){\\right)}}{y {1b}}{k n^2}{\\left(}w^(n ) {,}+ ... {\\right)}.\\ ] ] again , the first non - vanishing contribution is from that has the same singularity structure as the vector in  leading to a cancellation , in addition to the following finite part : the last line follows because only -independent pieces of s can survive the -integrals . till here , we have treated s as fields depending on individual external momenta and eq .  is the complete 4-point effective action . assuming them to be momentum independent , we can further simplify this expression in case of the u(1 ) gauge group and perform the integral over loop - momentum to get where we used the reduction to 4d for . using this and the fact that is related to , we get the same non - holomorphic 4-point contribution ( with the full superspace measure ) to n=4 sym action rather directly when compared to the calculation done in ( for similar calculations in see , for example , ) . ] 2-loops + + + + + + + we can also see that there are no uv divergences at two - loops . the proof is similar to that given in the ordinary case , i.e. , absence of sufficient s . only 3 diagrams shown in fig . are supposed to contribute at 2-loops . all of them will vanish due to the -algebra unless we get at least 4 s from the expansion of the propagators . this , as we have seen before , brings in 4 more s making these 2-loop diagrams convergent . furthermore , we note that the arguments of apply in our case since there is no background connection , there can not be any divergences at 2 or more loops from just power counting . this situation is different than where such ` 0-dimensional ' connections are present and arguments similar to the one given above involving number of s have to be used and at higher loops they can be quite involved . we have formulated the background field formalism for n=2 , 4d projective superspace . the crucial ingredient was to recognize that different representations for background and quantum pieces of the hypermultiplets are required . choosing real representation for the background fields allowed non - renormalization theorems to be applicable here as the lowest - dimensional fields available were spinors . the usual choice of analytic representation for the quantum fields allowed us to make a simple extension of the existing ` ordinary ' super - feynman rules to the background covariant rules . moreover , there are extra ghosts required ( apart from fp and nk ghosts ) to evaluate the full sym effective action . these extra ghosts also appear in the harmonic case but in projective case , they cancel the spurious ` harmonic ' divergences coming from vector hypermultiplet in a straightforward manner and the resultant finite pieces are as expected for n=4 . the uv divergent parts come only from the usual ( fp and nk ) ghosts and scalar hypermultiplet . however , their contribution can not be directly calculated in the formalism developed here for reasons mentioned in section . we also gave a diagrammatic 2-loops argument for finiteness of n=2 sym coupled with matter . this is easily supplanted by the power counting argument of in general , which directly leads to a proof for finiteness beyond 1-loop . for n=1 background formalism , there exist improved rules as showcased in and our hope is that such techniques could be applied to what we have developed in this paper . that would lead to a further simplification of the higher - loop calculations while also allowing explicit inclusion of the scalar hypermultiplet s 1-loop contribution . this research work is supported in part by nsf grant no . phy-0969739 . u. lindstrm and m. roek , commun . math . phys . http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=find+j+\"commun.math.phys.,115,21\"&of=hb&action search=search&sf=&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0 ; commun . http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=find+j+\"commun.math.phys.,128,191\"&of=hb&action search=search&sf=&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0 . w. siegel , 2010 , http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2317 ; + d. jain and w. siegel , phys . * d83 * ( 2011 ) 105024 ] ; + d. jain and w. siegel , phys . rev . * d86 * ( 2012 ) 065036 ] . d. jain and w. siegel , phys . * d86 * ( 2012 ) 125017 ] . s. m. kuzenko , int . * a14 * ( 1999 ) 1737 ] . d. jain and w. siegel , phys . * d80 * ( 2009 ) 045024 ] . a. galperin , e. ivanov , s. kalitzin , v. ogievetsky and e. sokatchev , class . http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=find+j+\"class.quant.grav.,1,469\"&of=hb&action search=search&sf=&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0 ; + e. ivanov , a. galperin , v. ogievetsky and e. sokatchev , class . http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=find+j+\"class.quant.grav.,2,601\"&of=hb&action search=search&sf=&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0 ; class . http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=find+j+\"class.quant.grav.,2,617\"&of=hb&action search=search&sf=&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0 ; + a.s . galperin , e.a . ivanov , v.i . ogievetsky , and e.s . sokatchev , harmonic superspace ( cambridge univ . press , 2001 ) . i. l. buchbinder , e. i. buchbinder , s. m. kuzenko and b. a. ovrut , phys . lett . * b417 * ( 1998 ) 61 ] ; + i. l. buchbinder and s. m. kuzenko , mod . phys . * a13 * ( 1998 ) 1623 ] . i. l. buchbinder , e. i. buchbinder , e. a. ivanov , s. m. kuzenko and b. a. ovrut , phys . lett . * b412 * ( 1997 ) 309 ] ; + i. l. buchbinder , s. m. kuzenko and b. a. ovrut , phys . lett . * b433 * ( 1998 ) 335 ] . e. i. buchbinder , i. l. buchbinder and s. m. kuzenko , phys . * b446 * ( 1999 ) 216 ] ; + s. m. kuzenko and i. n. mcarthur , phys . * b506 * ( 2001 ) 140 ] ; + s. m. kuzenko and i. n. mcarthur , phys . lett . * b513 * ( 2001 ) 213 ] . i. l. buchbinder , e. a. ivanov and a. y. petrov , nucl . phys . * b653 * ( 2003 ) 64 ] . i. l. buchbinder and a. yu . petrov , phys . * b482 * ( 2000 ) 429 ] . m. t. grisaru , w. siegel and m. roek , nucl . * b159 * ( 1979 ) 429 . m. t. grisaru and w. siegel , nucl . phys . * b201 * ( 1982 ) 292 . p. s. howe , k. s. stelle , p. c. west , phys . lett . * b124 * ( 1983 ) 55 . f. gonzalez -

( we treat projective hyperspace , but similar remarks apply for the harmonic case . ) in analogy to n=1 , background gauge fields are in the real representation , so the lowest - dimension potentials are spinor and the usual non - renormalization theorems are manifest . another consequence is that the r - coordinates disappear from the effective action ."}
{"article": "the experimental data used in this paper were collected by the forward looking radar of the us army research laboratory . that radar was built for detection and possible identification of shallow explosive - like targets . since targets are three dimensional objects , one needs to measure a three dimensional information about each target . however , the radar measures only one time dependent curve for each target , see figure 5 . therefore , one can hope to reconstruct only a very limited information about each target . so , we reconstruct only an estimate of the dielectric constant of each target . for each target , our estimate likely provides a sort of an average of values of its spatially distributed dielectric constant . but even this information can be potentially very useful for engineers . indeed , currently the radar community is relying only on the energy information of radar images , see , e.g. . estimates of dielectric constants of targets , if taken alone , can not improve the current false alarm rate . however , these estimates can be potentially used as an additional piece of information . being combined with the currently used energy information , this piece of the information might result in the future in new classification algorithms , which might improve the current false alarm rate . an inverse medium scattering problem ( imsp ) is often also called a coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) . imsps / cips are both ill - posed and highly nonlinear . therefore , an important question to address in a numerical treatment of such a problem is : how to reach a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact coefficient without any advanced knowledge of this neighborhood ? the size of this neighborhood should depend only on the level of noise in the data and on approximation errors . we call a numerical method , which has a rigorous guarantee of achieving this goal , globally convergent method ( gcm ) . in this paper we develop analytically a new globally convergent method for a 1-d inverse medium scattering problem ( imsp ) with the data generated by multiple frequencies . in addition to the analytical study , we test this method numerically using both computationally simulated and the above mentioned experimental data . first , we derive a nonlinear integro - differential equation in which the unknown coefficient is not present . element of this paper is the method of the solution of this equation . this method is based on the construction of a weighted least squares cost functional . the key point of this functional is the presence of the carleman weight function ( cwf ) in it . this is the function , which is involved in the carleman estimate for the underlying differential operator . we prove that , given a closed ball of an arbitrary radius with the center at in an appropriate hilbert space , one can choose the parameter of the cwf in such a way that this functional becomes strictly convex on that ball . the existence of the unique minimizer on that closed ball as well as convergence of minimizers to the exact solution when the level of noise in the data tends to zero are proven . in addition , it is proven that the gradient projection method reaches a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact coefficient if its starting point is an arbitrary point of that ball . the size of that neighborhood is proportional to the level of noise in the data . therefore , since restrictions on are not imposed in our method , then this is a globally convergent numerical method . we note that in the conventional case of a non convex cost functional a gradient - like method converges to the exact solution only if its starting point is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of this solution : this is due to the phenomenon of multiple local minima and ravines of such functionals . unlike previously developed globally convergent numerical methods of the first type for cips ( see this section below ) , the convergence analysis for the technique of the current paper does not impose a smallness condition on the interval of the variations of the wave numbers . the majority of currently known numerical methods of solutions of nonlinear ill - posed problems use the nonlinear optimization . in other words , a least squares cost functional is minimized in each problem , see , e.g. chavent , engl , gonch1,gonch2 . however , the major problem with these functionals is that they are usually non convex . figure 1 of the paper scales presents a numerical example of multiple local minima and ravines of non - convex least squares cost functionals for some cips . hence , convergence of the optimization process of such a functional to the exact solution can be guaranteed only if a good approximation for that solution is known in advance . however , such an approximation is rarely available in applications . this prompts the development of globally convergent numerical methods for cips , see , e.g. . the first author with coauthors has proposed two types of gcm for cips with single measurement data . the gcm of the first type is reasonable to call the tail functions method `` . this development has started from the work and has been continued since then , see , e.g. and references cited therein . in this case , on each step of an iterative process one solves the dirichlet boundary value problem for a certain linear elliptic pde , which depends on that iterative step . the solution of this pde allows one to update the unknown coefficient first and then to update a certain function , which is called the tail function '' . the convergence theorems for this method impose a smallness condition on the interval of the variation of either the parameter of the laplace transform of the solution of a hyperbolic equation or of the wave number in the helmholtz equation . recall that the method of this paper does not impose the latter assumption . in this paper we present a new version of the gcm of the second type . in any version of the gcm of the second type a weighted cost functional with a cwf in it is constructed . the same properties of the global strict convexity and the global convergence of the gradient projection method hold as the ones indicated above . the gcm of the second type was initiated in klib95,klib97,kt with a recently renewed interest in . the idea of any version of the gcm of the second type has direct roots in the method of , which is based on carleman estimates and which was originally designed in only for proofs of uniqueness theorems for cips , also see the recent survey in . another version of the gcm with a cwf in it was recently developed in bau1 for a cip for the hyperbolic equation where is the unknown coefficient . this gcm was tested numerically in . in bau1,bau2 non - vanishing conditions are imposed : it is assumed that either or or in the entire domain of interest . similar assumptions are imposed in for the gcm of the second type . on the other hand , we consider in the current paper , so as in , the fundamental solution of the corresponding pde . the differences between the fundamental solutions of those pdes and solutions satisfying non - vanishing conditions cause quite significant differences between klib95,klib97,kt , ktsiap and of corresponding versions of the gcm of the second type . recently , the idea of the gcm of the second type was extended to the case of ill - posed cauchy problems for quasilinear pdes , see the theory in klquasi and some extensions and numerical examples in bakklkosh , klkosh . cips of wave propagation are a part of a bigger subfield , inverse scattering problems ( isps ) . isps attract a significant attention of the scientific community . in this regard we refer to some direct methods which successfully reconstruct positions , sizes and shapes of scatterers without iterations . we also refer to for some other isps in the frequency domain . in addition , we cite some other numerical methods for isps considered in . as to the cips with multiple measurement , i.e. the dirichlet - to - neumann map data , we mention recent works and references cited therein , where reconstruction procedures are developed , which do not require a priori knowledge of a small neighborhood of the exact coefficient . in section 2 we state our inverse problem . in section 3 we construct that weighted cost functional . in section 4 we prove the main property of this functional : its global strict convexity . in section 5 we prove the global convergence of the gradient projection method of the minimization of this functional . although this paper is mostly an analytical one ( sections 3 - 5 ) , we complement the theory with computations . in section 6 we test our method on computationally simulated data . in section 7 we test it on experimental data . concluding remarks are in section 8 . let the function be the spatially distributed dielectric constant of the medium . we assume thatfix the source position for brevity , we do not indicate below dependence of our functions on consider the 1-d helmholtz equation for the function ,let be the solution of the problem  ,  for the case thenour interest is in the following inverse problem : * inverse medium scattering problem ( imsp)*. let \\subset \\left ( 0,\\infty \\right ) ] in addition , uniqueness of our imsp was proven in klibloc . also , the following asymptotic behavior of the function takes place : \\left ( 1+% \\left ( x , k\\right ) \\right ) , k\\rightarrow \\infty , \\forall x\\in % \\left , \\]] given  and  we now can uniquely define the function as in . the difficulty here is in defining since this number is usually defined up to the addition of where is an integer . for sufficiently large values of we define the function using  ,  ,  and  as where hence , for sufficiently large , which eliminates the above mentioned ambiguity . suppose that the number is so large that  is true for then is defined as in  . as to not large values of , we define the function  as by  , \\forall \\xi > 0. ] consider the function and its derivative , where hence,consider the function , which we call the tail function \" , and this function is unknown, let note that since for then equation  and the first condition  imply that for hence ,  and  imply that for it follows from  ,  ,  ,  and  that using  ,  ,  and  , we obtain differentiate  with respect to and use -

{"article": "the -transformation has been extensively studied since the seminal paper of rnyi in 1957 . there is a huge amount of literature on the map itself and on the associated symbolic dynamics . over the past decade , people became interested in the -transformation , changing the slope of the map from positive to negative . various studies have focused on the similarities and differences between the two maps from several points of view . this paper fits in this last line of research . the paper compares two aspects of the -shift to the -shift . for the -shift it is known that a prefix code always exists . the paper first investigates whether or not the same is true for the -shift . by -shift ( respectively -shift ) we understand the closure of the set of expansions in base ( respectively ) . the conclusion is stated in theorem , which says that a prefix code exists in the negative case only under certain conditions , namely if and only if is bigger than the golden ratio and the orbit of the left endpoint of the domain of the -transformation is not periodic with odd period . it turns out that the discovered prefix codes are recurrent . even though the codes can be complicated , the zeta functions apparently have a very simple form ( see theorem ) and it can be noted the similarities with that of the positive parameter determined in . rnyi introduced the -expansion of positive real numbers in : for a fixed real , all non - negative real number has one representation in base . he defined the -transformation from into by where denotes the largest integer less than . we can find a sequence of positive integers such that where the integer is taken in , and is the smallest positive integer for which belongs to the interval . various topics about -expansion have been studied . let be an integer strictly bigger than . it is well - known that any number can be represented without a sign in base thanks to digits of the alphabet . in 2009 , s. ito and t. sadahiro in generalized this approach for all negative base ( integer or not ) . they defined a -transformation , the map from the interval into itself such that the expansion in base of a real ( denoted by ) is given by the following algorithm : * if belongs to , where * if , one finds the smallest integer for which one has . in this case , the expansion is , where in both cases , . if there is no mixup , we often denote by . let be an alphabet . consider two words on , and . we denote by , the relation such that : if there exists an integer such that and . the relation is called * alternating lexicographic order*. this definition can be extended on infinite words on . in the following , we set with , , and where . the * -shift * is the sub - shift on the alphabet such that let us start by giving the definitions of the main terms used throughout this paper . let be an alphabet . a word on is a concatenation of elements of . let be a word on , we call sub - word ( or factor ) of all word which appears in . a language on is a set of words on ( or the set of finite sequences on ) . a language is extendable if for all word in , there exist two letters and in such that belongs to . it is said transitive if , there exists such that . let be a finite alphabet . one endows ( or ) with the topology product of the discrete topology on . let be the map from ( or ) into itself defined by . the closed -invariant subsets of are called sub - shifts . let be a sub - shift on an alphabet . the pair is called symbolic dynamical system . will be denoted by whenever there is no risk of mixup . a language of a dynamical system is the set of factors of words of . the system is transitive if its language is transitive . a code on an alphabet is a language such that , for any equality with one has and . let be a language on . in the following , denotes the concatenations of words of . we call prefix code a language for which no word is the beginning of another . where is the empty word . if in , no word ends by another , then the language is a suffix code . the symbolic dynamical system is said coded by the prefix code if is the set of factors of words contained in . let be a language on an alphabet . the radius of the power series is called radius of convergence of . a prefix code is said recurrent positive if let be a real number strictly bigger than 1 and the associated -shift . let be the expansion of 1 in base . is coded by the prefix code defined as follows : hence , all -shifts are coded . it is one of the differences between -shifts and -shifts . for a negative parameter , one of the natural and important question is whether the -shift is coded . in this section , we shall provide some contributions to this question . in fact , the -shifts , as defined above are not always coded . furthermore , when it is coded , to find an appropriate code for its language can be difficult according to the complexity of the expansion . we distinguish two cases : for all , ( the code is simple ) and for some ( in this case , it is not easy to determine a language which codes the -shift ) . let be a real number strictly bigger than 1 . the associated -shift is coded if only if is bigger than or equal to the golden ratio and is not periodic with odd period . let and the -expansion of . if for all integer , , then is bigger than or equal to the golden ratio . let be the golden ratio . to prove this lemma , it is enough to determine the -expansion of . in fact , if we consider two real numbers and strictly bigger than 1 then , we obtain the equivalence above thanks to lemma 3 of . we assume that and we set . then , that means there exists such that and . thus , and is even . so , there exists such that and . thus , if for all , . let be a real number strictly bigger than 1 . we denote by the associated -shift , the -expansion of . if is periodic with odd period or then , is not transitive . * assume . by lemma , there exists such that in the admissible words , the possible longest sequence of zeros has length . then , we can not add at right of 1 a long sequence of zeros . thus , is not transitive for . * assume that . consider a word such that then , there exists an integer , such that for and . that is . in other words , in fact , implies that if is even and if is odd . + but , . thus , . hence , it follows that . thus , for all of the form , with ( we have ) there does not exist such that . this implies that is not transitive . it is well - known that all coded system is transitive ( see ) . that is , a non transitive system can not be coded . thus , the previous proposition allows us to observe that for all such that is periodic with odd period or less than the golden ratio , is not a coded system . we denote by the set of words , , the concatenations of such words and the admissible words of . let , , and be the sets of words defined by : on one hand , if is less than or equal to the golden ratio , ; however if , by construction , is a prefix code on the alphabet . one essential property of is the fact that after a word of this language , we can add any admissible sequence . so , we distinguish two types of admissible words in : the ones starting by a word of and those starting by a word of and ending by a word of the type . * if for all , then , ; that is all concatenations of words of is admissible and * suppose there exists an integer such that . so , the expansion is defined thanks to sequences of positive integers ( increasing ) and such that : + in , the word follows . if , is periodic with odd period . if is not periodic with odd period , satisfies both following conditions : and . in this case , all concatenations of words of is not admissible . + let be the algebraic integer satisfying ; the sequence is finite : , , and thus we have , , and . + we set . is the set of concatenations of words of two types : for some integer ( we suppose that ) , and where , satisfies and . + moreover , with . note that if for some integer , we have both conditions and . it follows that if , we have thus , the words of are of the form where satisfies or and or with , and . from theorem 3 of , if ( that is ) , all sequence between and can not be the expansion of , for some except . then , there exists such that . indeed , \\rightarrow ( d i) {i \\geq 1 } \\prec d 1.\\ ] ] so , we can find such that or belongs to . if and is not periodic with odd period , then for all , . from remark , contains at least one word such that . if , for all and with . thus , for all , is the beginning of a word of . we assume satisfied and is non - periodic with odd period . suppose that for all , is not the beginning of a word of . then , for all , and are consecutive ( with respect to the alternating order ) . that is . note that there does not exist an integer such that , otherwise for all with . if is even , , otherwise so moreover , implies that . since it follows that , then , . that is + 1 ] the set of words such that so , in the one - side symbolic dynamical system , the cylinder x \\in { } ] ; for , , \\cap = \\varnothing ] with , and $ ] . the -transformation is affine on each interval . moreover , if only if starts by . let . we set . we know that ( see ) . so , we have proved that for all , and , . note that , if , . in this case , the graph of the - transformation is given by segments . from the previous lemma , has laps if and laps otherwise . with and . it is easy to see that is the maximum ( with respect to the alternating order ) in the family of words of starting by . throughout the rest of this section , we set . let be the map from to defined by . is increasing in the sense of the alternating order ( see ) . it is easy to verify that the words and have same image by . indeed , we have the same result if in the remark , we replace by . let . it is the interval of real numbers of for which the -expansions begins by the admissible word . let . for , . from the previous corollary , that is begins by furthermore , consider the set of -expansions of reals of . * if ends by a word of the type with and , the -expansions of endpoints are and . in fact , in the -shift , is one of the endpoints -representations starting by . but , this word can not be an expansion . from remark , and have the same image by . * we assume that for all integer and ends by a sequence of the type , we set . thus , the word is a endpoint -expansion . the maximum in starting by is if is odd and if is even . this last word is not a -expansion . we replace it by * now , we assume that ends by a sequence of the type , even and , then , both infinite words and are the endpoints -expansions . + this last case implies that satisfies . in the language of , we know that is always followed by . thus , if , the endpoints of have expansions and . that is , for all and in , such that , suppose periodic with odd period . there exists such that and . ( c ) allows us to say that is reduced to the singleton } . it is not an interval . in fact , in an infinite admissible word , is always followed by itself . let be a real number strictly bigger than 1 and the language of the words such that from the previous corollary , one has for all fixed integer , rather than counting intervals , one can just counts the words of the language associated . this approach allows to obtain the laps of , for all . let . we recall that . from the formula for the factor complexity of the corrected -shift given in section 2 ( we can also see in ) , and from lemma , lemma , and remark , one has in fact , counts the number of words of length in the language of . then , by simple calculus in the open unit disk except in , hence the result . the following figures represent the graphs of , and respectively in . for ,width=377,height=113 ] for ,width=377,height=113 ] for ,width=377,height=113 ] we set and we verify easily that , and . the laps of correspond to the number of oblique segments in the different graphs . these oblique segments allow to determine the number of words of length in the -shift language . * for , we have three laps ( oblique segments ) and three admissible words of length 1 : 0 , 1 and 2  . * if , ; there are 8 oblique lines and then 8 admissible words of length 2 : 21 , 22 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 00 , 01 , 02 . * when , ; we count twenty laps , then there exist 20 admissible words of length : 211 , 210 , 222 , 221 , 102 , 101 , 100 , 112 , 111 , 110 , 122 , 121 , 002 , 001 , 000 , 012 , 011 , 010 , 022 , 021 . the notion of dynamical zeta function was been introduced by m. artin and b. mazur in 1965 . we consider a diffeomorphism on a compact space such that all of its iterates have isolated fixed points . the zeta function associated to is given by : where counts the number of fixed points of , by analogy with the geometric zeta function . in 1994 , lepold flatto , jeffrey lagarias and bjorn poonen ( see ) dealt with the zeta function of the -transformation . they consider the application from to defined by : where denotes the fractional part of . the associated zeta function is : where counts the number of fixed points of . in other words , is the number of periodic admissible sequences with period . we denote by the expansion of in base . and then , since the expansion is unique for each number and all sub - words of an admissible word is an expansion . after the introduction of the -expansion in 2009 by ito and sadahiro in , in the following sentences , we focus our study on the determination of the zeta functions of the -transformation and the one of the -shift endowed with the shift . let be a symbolic dynamical system . suppose coded by . the code is said exhaustive if all periodic word can be written uniquely as : where and have the same orbit . let be a coded system defined by an exhaustive prefix code . then , if counts the number of periodic words of period in the associated zeta function is defined by where counts the number of words of length n in . let be the sequence of positive integers such that counts the number of periodic words of length having the same orbit than a product of pieces of the exhaustive prefix code . thus , . in the sense of formal power series , we rewrite as : let k pieces of with and two integers such that where is minimal , that is denotes the smallest word ( in size ) with orbit . then , thus , minimal , , the integer counts the periodic words resulting to the circular permutations of concatenations of monotonic piecewises of the code . then , regardless of the commutative property of the multiplication in , and in the sense of formal power series , but that is , hence , then , we obtain . theorem traduce an important property of coded systems : the density of the set of periodic points . let be a real number , . let be the -shift and the expansion of 1 in base . we assume not to be a simple -number and we set . the -shift is coded by which is an exhaustive prefix code . the integer counts the number of pieces of length in . thus , the zeta function associated to is given by : we consider a real number . recall that the -transformation denotes the map from into itself defined by : the aim of this section is to determine the zeta function of the map . we know that each number has a -representation in . moreover , it is easy to see that a real is a fixed point of if only if the -representation of in is periodic with period dividing . let be a real number strictly greater than 1 , the -expansion of and the zeta function of the -transformation . then , in the ball of radius and center 0 , * if is not periodic * if is periodic with period , if we consider a real and the -expansion of 1 , the zeta function of the -shift , determined by leopold flatto , jeffrey lagarias and bjorn poonen in , is given by so , we remark some similarities between this zeta function and that of the -shift given in the previous theorem . for instance , is a pole of these both functions . let and periodic with period . then , . suppose . since furthermore , since and , it follows that thus , . this is absurd . then , . as consequence , ( with ) is not periodic . then , in addition to periodic words listed in the previous paragraphs , if is periodic with even period , we should take account of circular permutations of . for each integer , there are words . let be the set of -expansions of real numbers which belongs to . we know that the correspondence is one to one . in fact , each real number has one and only one -expansion . moreover , is invariant by the shift ( all infinite sub - words of a -expansion is a -expansion ) . let and . then , . so , if is a fixed point of , then is periodic with period dividing . the number of fixed points of equals the number of periodic orbits in with period dividing . note that in , the sequences which are not -expansions end by ( with ) . when is not periodic with odd period is not periodic . in this case , the periodic orbits of belong to . when is periodic with odd period , is periodic . the periodic orbits of belong to except . in section 2 , we distinguished in three types of admissible concatenations and then three types of periodic words : * at first , there are the concatenations in ; * secondly , the concatenations of words of ; * and finally , there are products of words of , for all positive integer . in other hands , the periodic orbits of are circular permutations of sequences of , if non periodic . for the periodic case with period , we add the circular permutations of . the sets , and are coded by , and respectively . let , , and be the number of periodic orbits of period dividing in , , and respectively . if is not periodic , if is periodic with period , if is periodic with period odd , thus , is product of elementary zeta functions of , , and also ( if is periodic with period ) . from theorem , if is not periodic ; or if is periodic with period . we conclude thanks to . the previous theorem can be proved also just using the lap - counting function . indeed , from the equation and the formula of the factor complexity , the coefficients of the power series expansions of the fractional functions , and for all , count the fixed points of iterates of except the orbit of the left end point of when its expansion is periodic . furthermore , and provide us an interesting information on the influence of gaps in the interval on the -transformation zeta function for . they correspond to factors in the denominator of the zeta function . from section and theorem , we have the following relation between the zeta - function of the -transformation and its lap - counting function : let be the golden ratio : , . the zeta function is given by two types of periodic words : the sequences of zero and words such that . , . moreover , the -shift and the -transformation have the same zeta function , since is not periodic . thus moreover , . then , we verify easily that . the previous remark allows to observe that the relation between the zeta function of the -transformation and its lap - counting function differs a little bit from that of the -transformation and the associated lap - counting function . indeed , denote by and the zeta function and the lap - counting function of the -transformation , according to , if is not simple -number . consider a real number . we have seen that when is not periodic with odd period , is not periodic and for a periodic orbit , in other words , all periodic word is a -expansion . and then , and have the same zeta function . however , if is periodic with odd period , is periodic too ( with period ) . but , it is not an expansion in base . let counts the number of fixed points of and the number of periodic words with period dividing in . we have the following result counts the circular permutations of the sequences . we denote by the zeta function of the -shif . then , in short , , finally , we have seen that for a real number , the associated -shift is coded if only if and the -expansion of is not periodic with odd period . the non - coded case is due to the existence of intransitive words in the language of the system . in the periodic case with odd period , shall we say , the word is intransitive . for , is an intransitive word , with , where , , , and . moreover , the zeta - functions of the - shift and - shift ( determined by leopold flatto , jeffrey c. lagarias and bjorn poonen in ) have some similarities : is a pole for these both functions . however , if we consider as -shift , the table above changes a little bit : is coded if only if is greater than or equal to the golden ratio . but , if less than the golden ratio , the systems or contains coded sub - shift with maximal entropy . jeffrey c. lagarias . number theory zeta functions and dynamical zeta functions . in spectral problems in geometry and arithmetic ( iowa city , ia , 1997 ) , volume : 237 of contemp . math . pages 4586 , 1999 .", "summary": "given a real number , we study the associated -shift introduced in . we compares some aspects of the -shift to the -shift . when the expansion in base of is periodic with odd period or when is strictly less than the golden ratio , the -shift , as defined in can not be coded because its language is not transitive . this intransitivity of words explains the existence of gaps in the interval . we observe that an intransitive word appears in the -expansion of a real number taken in the gap . furthermore , we determine the zeta function of the -transformation and the associated lap -

{"article": "although the sunspot number varies periodically with time with an average period of 11 year , the individual cycle period ( length ) and also the strength ( amplitude ) vary in a random way . it is observed that the stronger cycles have shorter periods and vice versa . this leads to an important feature of solar cycle known as waldmeier effect . it says that there is an anti - correlation between the rise time and the peak sunspot number . we call this as we1 . now instead of rise time if we consider the rise rate then we get very tight positive correlation between the rise rate and the peak sunspot number . we call this as we2 . another important aspect of solar activity are the grand minima . these are the periods of strongly reduced activity . a best example of these is the during during 16451715 . it was not an artifact of few observations , but a real phenomenon ( hoyt & schatten 1996 ) . from the study of the cosmogenic isotope c data in tree rings , usoskin et al . ( 2007 ) reported that there are grand minimum during last years . we want to model these irregularities of solar cycle using flux transport dynamo model ( choudhuri et al . 1995 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; chatterjee et al . 2004 ) . in this model , the turbulent diffusivity is an important ingredient which is not properly constrained . therefore several groups use different value of diffusivity and this leads to two kinds of flux transport dynamo model high diffusivity model and low diffusivity model . in the earlier model , the value of diffusivity usually used is s ( see also jiang et al . 2007 and yeates et al . 2008 for details ) , whereas in the latter model , it is s . we mention that the mixing length theory gives the value of diffusivity as s . another important flux transport agent in this model is the meridional circulation . only since 1990 s we have some observational data of meridional circulation near the surface and therefore we do not know whether the varied largely with solar cycle in past or not . however if the flux transport dynamo is the correct dynamo for the solar cycle , then one can consider the solar cycle period variation as the variation for the because the cycle period is strongly determined by the strength of the meridional circulation in this model . now the periods of the solar cycle indeed had much variation in past , then we can easily say that the had significant variation with the solar cycle . therefore the main sources of randomness in the flux transport dynamo model are the stochastic fluctuations in process of generating poloidal field and the stochastic fluctuations in the meridional circulation . in this paper we explore the effects of fluctuations of the latter . we model last cycles by fitting the periods with variable meridional circulation in a high diffusivity model based on chatterjee et al . ( 2004 ) model . the solid line in fig . (a ) shows the variation of the amplitude of used to model the periods of the cycles . note that we did not try to match the periods of each cycles accurately which is bit difficult . we change between two cycles and not during a cycle . in addition , we do not change if the period difference between two successive cycles is less than of the average period . ( in m s ) with time ( in yr ) . the solid line is the variation of used to match the theoretical periods with the observed periods . ( b ) variation of theoretical sunspot number ( dashed line ) and observed sunspot number ( solid line ) with time . ( c ) scatter diagram showing peak theoretical sunspot number and peak observed sunspot number . the linear correlation coefficients and the corresponding significance levels are given on the plot.,scaledwidth=100.0% ] in fig . (b ) , we show the theoretical sunspot series ( eruptions ) by dashed line along with the observed sunspot series by solid line . the theoretical sunspot series has been multiplied by a factor to match the observed value . it is very interesting to see that most of the amplitudes of the theoretical sunspot cycle have been matched with the observed sunspot cycle . therefore , we have found a significant correlation between these two ( see fig . (c ) ) . this study suggests that a major part of the fluctuations of the amplitude of the solar cycle may come from the fluctuations of the meridional circulation . this is a very important result of this analysis . now we explain the physics of this result based on yeates et al . toroidal field in the flux transport model , is generated by the stretching of the poloidal field in the tachocline . the production of this toroidal field is more if the poloidal field remains in the tachocline for longer time and vice versa . however , the poloidal field diffuses during its transport through the convection zone . as a result , if the diffusivity is very high , then much of the poloidal field diffuses away and very less amount of it reaches the tachocline to induct toroidal field . therefore , when we decrease in high diffusivity model to match the period of a longer cycle , the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse during its transport through the convection zone . this ultimately leads to a lesser generation of toroidal field and hence the cycle becomes weaker . on the other hand , when we increase the value of to match the period of a shorter cycle , the poloidal field does not get much time to diffuse in the convection zone . hence it produces stronger toroidal field and the cycle becomes stronger . consequently , we get weaker amplitudes for longer periods and vice versa . however , this is not the case in low diffusivity model because in this model the diffusive decay of the fields are not much important . as a result , the slower meridional circulation means that the poloidal field remains in the tachocline for longer time and therefore it produces more toroidal field , giving rise to a strong cycle . therefore , we do not get a correct correlation between the amplitudes of theoretical sunspot number and that of observed sunspot number when repeat the same analysis in low diffusivity model based on dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) model . we study the using flux transport dynamo model . we have seen that the stochastic fluctuations in the process and the stochastic fluctuations in the are the two main sources of irregularities in this model . therefore , to study we first introduce suitable stochastic fluctuations in the poloidal field source term of process . we see that this study can not reproduce we1 ( fig . (a ) ) . however it reproduces we2 ( fig . (b ) ) . finally we introduce stochastic fluctuations in both the poloidal field source term and the meridional circulation . we see that both we1 and we2 are remarkably reproduced in this case ( see fig . ) . we repeat the same study in low diffusivity model based on dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) model . however in this case we are failed to reproduce we1 , only we2 is reproduced . the details of this work can be found in karak & choudhuri ( 2011 ) . we have realized that the is important in modeling many aspects of solar cycle . therefore we check whether a large decrease of the leads to a maunder - like grand minimum . to answer this question , we decrease to a very low value in both the hemispheres . we have done this in the decaying phase of the last sunspot cycle before maunder minimum . we keep at low value for around 1 yr and then we again increase it to the usual value but at different rates in two hemispheres . in northern hemisphere , is increased at slightly lower rate than southern hemisphere .

(c ) , we show the variation of total sunspot number along with the individual sunspot numbers in two hemispheres ( see the caption ) . in order to facilitate comparison with observational data , we have taken the beginning of the year to be 1635 . note that our theoretical results reproduce the sudden initiation and the gradual recovery , the north - south asymmetry of sunspot number observed in the last phase of maunder minimum and the cyclic oscillation of solar cycle found in cosmogenic isotope data . we also mention that if we reduce the poloidal field to a very low value at the beginning of the maunder minimum then also we can reproduce maunder - like grand minimum ( choudhuri & karak 2009 ) . however in both the cases , either we need to reduce the or the poloidal field at the beginning of the maunder minimum . however if we reduce the poloidal field little bit , then one can reproduce maunder - like grand minimum at a moderate value of meridional circulation . the details of this study can be found in karak ( 2010 ) . we have shown that with a suitable stochastic fluctuations in the meridional circulation , we are able to reproduce many important irregular features of solar cycle including waldmeier effect and maunder like grand minimum . however we are failed to reproduce these results in low diffusivity model . therefore this study along with some earlier studies ( chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri 2004 ; chatterjee & choudhuri 2006 ; goel & choudhuri 2009 ; jiang , chatterjee & choudhuri 2007 ; karak 2010 ; karak & choudhuri 2011 ; karak & choudhuri 2012 ) supports the high diffusivity model for solar cycle . chatterjee , p. , nandy , d. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2004 , a&a , 427 , 1019 choudhuri , a. r. , chatterjee , p. , & jiang , j. , 2007 , phys . , 98 , 1103 choudhuri , a. r. , & karak , b. b. 2009 , raa 9 , 953 choudhuri , a. r. , schssler , m. , & dikpati , m. 1995 , a&a , 303 , l29 dikpati , m. , & charbonneau , p. 1999 , apj , 518 , 508 jiang , j. , chatterjee , p. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2007 , mnras , 381 , 1527 hoyt , d. v. , & schatten , k. h. , 1996 , sol . phys . , 165 , 181 karak , b. b. 2010 , apj , 724 , 1021 karak , b. b. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2011 , mnras , 410 , 1503 karak , b. b. , & choudhuri , a. r. 2012 , sol . , 278:137 usoskin , i. g. , solanki , s. k. , & kovaltsov , g. a. 2007 , a&a , 471 , 301 yeates , a. r. , nandy , d. , & mackay , d. h. 2008 , apj , 673 , 544", "summary": "the sunspot number varies roughly periodically with time . however the individual cycle durations and the amplitudes are found to vary in an irregular manner . it is observed that the stronger cycles are having shorter rise times and vice versa . this leads to an important effect know as the waldmeier effect . another important feature of the solar cycle irregularity are the grand minima during which the activity level is strongly reduced . we explore whether these solar cycle irregularities can be studied with the help of the flux transport dynamo model of the solar cycle . we show that with a suitable stochastic fluctuations in a regular dynamo model , we are able to reproduce many irregular features of the solar cycle including the waldmeier effect and the grand minimum . however , we get all these results only if the value of the turbulent diffusivity in the convection zone is reasonably high ."}
{"article": "reticulation processes refer to the transfer of genetic material between living organisms in a non - reproduction manner . horizontal gene transfer is believed to be a highly significant reticulation process occurring between single - cell organisms ( doolittle and bapteste 2007 ; treangen and rocha 2011 ) . other reticulation processes include introgression , recombination and hybridization ( fontaine et al . 2015 ; mcbreen and lockhart 2006 ; marcussen et al . 2014 ) . in the past two decades , phylogenetic networks have often been seen for the modeling and visualization of reticulation processes ( gusfield 2014 ; huson et al . 2011 ) . galled trees , galled networks , reticulation visible networks are three of the popular classes of phylogenetic networks introduced to study the combinatorial and algorithmic perspectives of phylogenetics ( wang et al . 2001 ; gusfield et al . 2004 ; huson and kloepper 2007 ; huson et al . 2011 ) . reticulation visible networks include galled trees and galled networks . they are tree - based ( gambette et al . 2015 ) . the tree - based networks are introduced by francis and steel ( 2015 ) recently . it is well known that the number of internal nodes in a phylogenetic tree with leaves is . in contrast , an arbitrary phylogenetic network with 2 leaves can have as many internal nodes as possible . therefore , one interesting research problem is how large a phylogenetic network in a particular class can be . for example , it is well known that a tree - child network with leaves has non - leaf nodes at most . a regular network with leaves has nodes at most ( willson 2010 ) . to investigate whether or not the tree containment problem is polynomial time solvable , surprisingly , gambette et al . ( 2015 ) proved that a reticulation visible network with leaves has at most non - leaf nodes . the class of nearly - stable networks was also introduced in their paper . they also proved the existence of a linear upper bound on the number of reticulation nodes in a nearly - stable network . in the present paper , we establish the tight upper bound for the size of a network defined by a visibility property using a sub - tree technique that was introduced in gambette et al . the rest of this paper is divided into six sections . section introduces concepts and notation that are necessary for our study . recently , bordewich and semple ( 2015 ) proved that there are at most reticulation nodes in a reticulation visible network . in section , we present a different proof of the tight bound for reticulation visible networks . section proves that there are at most reticulation nodes in a galled networks with leaves . section and establish the tight upper bounds for the sizes of nearly - stable and stable - child networks , respectively . in section , we conclude the work with a few remarks . an acyclic digraph is a simple connected digraph with no directed cycles . let be an acyclic digraph and let and be two nodes in . if , it is called an outgoing edge of and incoming edge of ; and are said to be the tail and head of the edge . the numbers of incoming and outgoing edges of a node are called its indegree and outdegree , respectively . is said to be rooted if there is a unique node with indegree 0 ; is called the root of . note that in a rooted acyclic digraph there exists a directed path from the root to every other node . for , denotes the digraph with the same node set and the edge set . for , denotes the digraph with the node set and the edge set . if and are subdigraphs of , denotes the subdigraph with the node set and the edge set . a phylogenetic network on a finite set of taxa , , is a rooted acyclic digraph in which each non - root node has either indegree 1 or outdegree 1 and there are exactly nodes of outdegree 0 and indegree 1 , called leaves , that correspond one - to - one with the taxa in the network . in a phylogenetic network , a node is called a tree node if it is either the root or a node having indegree one ; it is called a reticulation node if its indegree is greater than one . note that leaves are tree nodes and a tree node may have both indegree and outdegree one . a non - leaf node is said to be internal . a phylogenetic network without reticulation nodes is simply a phylogenetic tree . for a phylogenetic network , we use the following notation : * : the root of . * : the set of nodes . * : the set of tree nodes . * : the set of reticulation nodes . * : the set of edges . * : the set of leaves . for two nodes in , if , is said to be a parent of and , equivalently , is a child of . in general , if there is a directed path from to , is an ancestor of and is a descendant of . we sometimes say that is below when is an ancestor of . let and be two simple paths from to in . we use and to denote their node sets , respectively . they are internally disjoint if . finally , a phylogenetic network is binary , if its root has outdegree 2 and indegree 0 , all internal nodes have degree 3 , and all the leaves have indegree one . here , we are interested in how large a binary phylogenetic network can be . in the rest of the paper , a binary phylogenetic work is simply called a network and a phylogenetic tree a tree . for sake of convenience for discussion , we also add an open edge entering the root of a network . a node in a network is visible ( or stable ) with respect to a leaf if is in every path from the network root to . we say visible if it is visible with respect to some leaf in the network . let be a network and a subnetwork of with the same root and leaves as . then , a node is visible in if it is visible in . equivalently , a node is not visible in if it is not visible in . suppose is visible with respect to a leaf in . for each path from to , since it is also a path from to in , it must pass through . thus , is also visible with respect to the same leaf in . reticulation visible networks are networks in which reticulation nodes are all visible ( huson et al . they are also called stable networks by gambette et al . ( 2015 ) . a network is galled if every reticulation node has an ancestor such that there are two disjoint tree paths from to ( huson and kloepper 2007 ) . here , a path is tree path if its internal nodes are all tree nodes in the network . galled networks are reticulation visible and are also known as level-1 networks . nearly - stable networks are networks in which for every pair of nodes and , either or is visible if is an edge ( gambette et al . 2015 ) . stable - child networks are networks in which every node has a visible child . tree - based networks comprise another interesting class of networks that is introduced recently ( francis and steel 2015 ) . a network is tree - based if it can be obtained from a tree with the same leaves by the insertion of a set of edges between different edges in the tree . ( gambette et al . 2015 ) for every reticulation - visible network , there exists a subset of edges such that contains exactly an incoming edge for each reticulation node and is a subtree with the same leaves as . theorem indicates that every reticulation visible network is tree - based . however , nearly - stable networks and stable - child networks are not necessarily tree - based . we finish this section by presenting a technical lemma that will frequently be used in establishing the tight upper bound on the size of a network in each of the four classes defined above . let be a network , , and be a finite set of reticulation nodes below . if each has a parent such that either ( a ) is below another in , or ( b ) there is a path from to that avoids , then there exists a path from to avoiding for every leaf below a reticulation node . let . assume is below some . then , there is a path from to that avoids . since is finite and is acyclic , there exists a series of reticulation nodes , such that : \\(i ) each has a parent below for , and \\(ii ) the node has a parent such that there is a path from to that avoids . since is below , there exists a path from to for each . since is acyclic and is below , the path avoids . concatenating these paths , we obtain the following path from to that avoids . gambette et al . ( 2015 ) proved that there are at most reticulation nodes in a reticulation visible network with labeled leaves . on the other hand , there are as many as reticulations in the reticulation visible network in figure . so , what is the tight upper bound on the number of reticulation nodes ? interestingly , is the tight upper bound , which was independently proved by bordewich and semple ( 2015 ) using the induction approach . here , we present an alternative proof to illustrate our approach . are of degree 3 ,scaledwidth=80.0% ] given a reticulation visible network with leaves , we let be a set of edges such that is a subtree with the same root and leaves as ( theorem ) . since has leaves , there are exactly nodes of degree 3 . thus , there are paths whose internal nodes are of degree 2 , starting at a degree-3 node and terminating at either another node of degree 3 or a leaf . let these paths be . the edges of not in make up a path that contains the root ( figure ) . if is of degree 2 , passes through and terminates at a degree-3 node . if is of degree 3 , is simply the open edge entering . altogether , these paths are called the trivial paths of . note that . it is not hard to see that , for each edge in , its head and tail are both found in these trivial paths . an edge is called a cross edge if and for ; it is called non - cross edge otherwise . the facts in the following proposition appear in the proof of theorem 1 in gambette et al ( 2015 ) . * no two cross edges have their heads in the same trivial path in . * for each non - cross edge such that for some , there are at least one cross edge such that is between and in . for a cross edge such that and  , we say leaves and enters . for a non - cross path and a cross edge , if and are in and is a node between and in , we say jumps over . it is trivial to see that no cross edge enters the trivial path . proposition suggests that contains at most cross edges and thus at most non - cross edges . by theorem , . to obtain the tight upper bound for , we define the cost of a cross edge as : we will charge the cost of a cross edge to the trivial path it enters and call it the weight of the trivial path . if no cross edge enters a trivial path , the weight of this trivial path is set to be 0 . by proposition , the weight of a trivial path is at most 2 . we use to denote the weight of a trivial path , . . are the three trivial paths incident to a degree-3 node ; is the cross edge ending at in and the non - cross edge jumps over for . here , is not drawn . ( * a * ) and are both between and in . ( * b * ) is between and in , but is below in . ( * c * ) the node is below and is below . this case is impossible to occur , as there is a directed cycle . ,scaledwidth=95.0% ] for an internal node of degree 3 in , we use to denote the trivial path entering and to denote the two trivial paths leaving . let be a degree-3 node in . \\(i ) if and , then . \\(ii ) if , then and . for sake of simplicity , we let and use to denote the unique path from to for a node and a descendant of in . and have the same root and leaves . the common root of and is written . \\(i ) assume that and . then , there exists a cross edge entering and a non - cross edge jumping over for each . we shall prove that by showing that no cross edge enters . assume is between and in . when is below in ( figure a ) , there are two cases . if is in the path or below it , then , does not pass . if is not below , does not pass and so . therefore , by lemma , there is path from to every leaf below that does not pass . for any leaf not below in , avoids . hence , is a reticulation node in , but not visible . this is a contradiction . when is below in ( figure b ) , is below as a reticulation node . since does not pass , by lemma , there is a path from to a leaf below that does not pass . for any leaf not below in , avoids . hence , is not visible , a contradiction . we have proved that is not between and in the tree path . by symmetry , is not between and in . assume there is a cross edge enters . let be the lowest reticulation node in . then , and are both not in . otherwise , either or is between and , contradicting that is the lowest reticulation node in . combining this fact with that is not between and in for , we conclude that either is below or there is a path from to not passing for each . hence , by lemma , is not visible with respect to any leaf below . for any leaf not below in , the tree path avoids . hence , is not visible , a contradiction . we have proved that . \\(ii ) if , then is an ancestor of any other degree-3 node in . since is acyclic , there does not exist such that for some and . hence , . assume on the contrary the weights of and are both 2 . then , is not between and for , proved above . if or is in , the lowest reticulation in is not visible , a contradiction . otherwise , is below and is below , implying a cycle in ( figure c ) . this is a contradiction . hence , either or has weight less than 2 . let be a reticulation visible network with leaves . then , let denote the set of internal nodes of degree 3 in . note that any trivial path other than starts with a node in define : for . clearly , s are pairwise disjoint and hence when , . by proposition , . let be the start node of for each . again , by proposition , . it is clear that under the map , at most two nodes in are mapped to the same node in , and different nodes in are mapped to different nodes in . thus , . since , the inequality implies that \\\\ & = & |v 1|+2|v 2|+3|v 3|+ ( 3|v 4|+|v 4| ) \\\\ & \\leq & 2(|v 0|+|v 1| ) + 3(|v 2|+|v 3|+|v 4|)\\\\ & \\leq & 3(|v 0|+|v 1|+|v 2|+|v 3|+|v 4|)\\\\ & = & 3(n-1 ) , \\ ] ] where the first inequality is derived from the substitution of for . galled networks form a subclass of reticulation visible networks ( huson et al . 2011 ) . in this section , we shall show that there are at most reticulations in a galled network with leaves . given that the galled network shown in figure a has exactly reticulations , is the tight bound on the number of reticulation nodes in a galled network with leaves . : there is a non - cross edge in such that and are in , and there is a cross - edge edge and a non - cross edge both ending at a node in a trivial path other than , where is not drawn . in ( * b * ) and ( * c * ) , solid straight and curve arrows represent edges and paths in , respectively ; round dot arrows represent edges in , respectively ,scaledwidth=80.0% ] for a galled network with leaves , let be a galled network with leaves and let . since is reticulation visible , by theorem , there is a set of edges such that ( a ) contains exactly one incoming edge for each reticulation node and ( b ) is a subtree with the same leaves as . we use the same notation as in section 3 . denotes the trivial path whose first edge is the open edge entering ; denote the other trivial paths in . we prove the result by showing that does not contain any non - cross edges and only one cross - edge can end at a node in each for . if contains only the open edge entering , there is no edge in that enters . we first prove that this fact is also true even if contains other edges below . since is acyclic and there is a directed path from the end of to a node in for any , there is no cross edge such that is in and is in . if there is a non - cross edge such that are in ( figure b ) , we let be the other child of in . then , must be a tree node such that , where is a reticulation node in some trivial path , . ( if is a reticulation , it is not visible , a contradiction . ) since is galled and is a reticulation node , there exist two paths and from a common tree node to in such that ( i ) they are internally disjoint and ( 2 ) is the only reticulation node in them . note that no edges in other than can appear in and . otherwise , either and contains another reticulation node . thus , is a subtree of . this implies that one of and is the single edge and the other is , the unique path from to in the tree . this is impossible , as the reticulation node is in . we have shown that there is no edge in that enters . next , we show that there is at most one edge in that enters for each . assume that and are two edges in such that is below in some  ( figure c ) . then , must be a non - cross edge and is also below . ( otherwise , is not visible . ) again , by fact ( 2 ) in proposition , there is a cross edge such that is between and in and is in , . since is a reticulation node and is galled , there are two internally disjoint paths and from a common tree node to in which any nodes other than are a tree node . if contains an edge in other than , the head of the edge is a reticulation node and appears in either or , a contradiction . hence , is a subtree of . without loss of generality , we may assume contains . that is , is the last edge of . note that are all nodes in , ordered from top to bottom . if contains more than one edge in , it must pass through , a contradiction . if is equal to , then must pass through , a contradiction . therefore , there is at most one edge in whose head is in each trivial path , . in summary , there are trivial paths other than and there is at most one edge in entering each of them . hence , in this section we will give a tight bound for the number of reticulations in a nearly - stable network . the class of nearly - stable networks is different from the class of reticulation visible networks , but surprisingly the tight upper bound is also . the network shown in figure a is an example for a nearly - stable network with reticulations . we need the following fact , proved by gambette et al . ( 2015 ) . let be a nearly - stable network with leaves . there exists a set of edges such that ( a ) is a reticulation visible subnetwork over the same leaves as , and ( b ) contains exactly one incoming edge for each reticulation node that is not visible in . with four leaves . it has nine reticulations ( shaded circles ) , five of which are not visible . the round dot edges are those removed to obtain the reticulation visible network in ( * b * ) . the dashed paths in are the cross and non - cross paths removed to obtain a subtree with the same leaves as . ( * c * ) and ( * d * ) are two cases considered in the proof of the part ( c ) in lemma : a non - cross path from and contains a tree node of , and it contains a reticulation node of ,scaledwidth=90.0% ] let be the set of edges satisfying the two properties in proposition and let ( figure a ) . the edges in are said to be ns - edges . we remark that is a subdivision of a binary reticulation visible network . that is , the reticulation visible network can be obtained from by replacing some paths whose internal nodes are of degree 2 with directed edges with the same orientation . hence , contains degree-2 nodes if is not empty . for a path , we use to denote the set of its internal nodes . since is a subdivision of a binary reticulation visible network with the same leaves as , by theorem , there is a set of paths in such that ( i ) each path is from a degree-3 tree node to a visible reticulation node in and its internal nodes are all of degree-2 in , and ( ii ) is a subtree with the same leaves as . let . is obtained from the removal of the internal nodes and edges of the paths in . we can classify the paths in as cross paths and non - cross paths accordingly as in section 3 ( figure b ) . let be a nearly - stable network and let , , and be defined above . \\(a ) every internal node in a path in is not visible in . \\(b ) each cross path in consists of either a single edge or two edges in . \\(c ) each non - cross path in is simply an edge in . \\(d ) if is a cross path in from to and is a non - cross path in from to such that is between and ( figure b ) , then and are both a single edge in . \\(e ) every two distinct paths in are node disjoint . we remark that denotes the unique path from to for any two nodes and in . \\(a ) let be a path in and let be an internal node of it . for any leaf , the unique path does not pass in . hence , is not visible in . \\(b ) if there are two or more internal nodes in a path in , by ( a ) , they are consecutive and not visible in , contradicting that is nearly - stable . \\(c ) we use to denote the root of , which is also the root of and . let be a non - cross path between and , where and are in some path in . note that is a sub - path of and is internally disjoint from . by fact ( 2 ) in proposition , there is an internal node in that is the start node of a cross path in . first , any node between and in is not visible . this is because for any network leaf not below in , does not pass through , and for any network leaf below in , is a path not passing through . therefore , must be the unique internal node of . that is , is the child of and the parent of in . assume that is not an edge in . by ( a ) , there is a unique degree-2 node between and in . we consider the following two cases . if ( figure c ) , then the other outgoing edge had been removed to obtain . that is , . by the definition of , is a reticulation node and not visible in . that and are both not visible contradicts that is nearly - stable . if ( figure d ) , then the other incoming edge had been removed to obtain . note that and , as has degree 3 in . in addition , is not an internal node of a path in . ( otherwise , by ( a ) , and are both not visible ) . so is a node in . clearly is not below and hence not below in . ( otherwise has a cycle . ) hence , does not pass through . consider a network leaf . if it is not below , then does not pass through . if is below , then is a path not passing through in . therefore , is not visible . that and are both not visible in contradicts that is nearly - stable . \\(d ) by the proof of ( c ) , is a single edge in and is the only node in and not visible . thus must be an edge in . ( otherwise by ( a ) and its child in are not visible , contradicting that is nearly - stable . ) \\(e ) it can be easily derived from the definition of the cross path . let be a cross path from to . then , is a visible reticulation node in . it may have as many as two reticulation parents that are not visible . let , where is the set of all parents of and is the set of all reticulation nodes that are not visible in . or . define the cost of as : where is used to count and the other child of which is a visible reticulation node if there is a non - cross edge jumping over . as in section , we let denote the trivial path whose first edge is the incoming edge to and let denote the other trivial paths in . we charge the cost of a cross path to the trivial path in in which the cross path enters and call it the weight of . the weight of is denoted by . if a trivial path does not contain any end node of the cross paths in , its weight is set to be 0 . each visible reticulation node contributes to at least one unit of weight . by the definition of nearly - stable networks , any reticulation node that is not visible must have a visible reticulation node as its child , and by the proof of lemma ( c ) , any reticulation node that is not visible in must be in some , being the end node of a cross path , so it also contributes to at least one unit weight . therefore , . to bound this , we first establish a useful lemma . as in section , we use to denote the trivial path entering and , to denote the trivial paths leaving for a node of degree 3 in . . solid arrows and curves represent the edges and paths in , while square dot arrows and curves represent the removed edges and paths . is the reticulation child of in a trivial path leaving . is the child of in the trivial path . the path from to is a cross path entering .

( * c * ) has a parent and a sibling under such that and has a common parent . ( * d * ) neither ( * b * ) nor ( * c * ) is true .

edges . each sc - edge is from a tree node to a reticulation node . a sc - edge is concealed if the head is a visible reticulation node ; it is revealed otherwise . note that a concealed sc - edge is deleted only when the case shown in figure c is satisfied . therefore , a concealed sc - edge jumps over the associated revealed sc - edge that is removed at the same time . it is not hard to see that the sc - edges that are removed when different reticulation nodes are considered are different . let be the set of sc - edges . first , we only deleted an incoming edge for each reticulation node and did not delete the incoming edge for each tree node , so the resulting network is connected . second , has the same leaves as . the reasons for this include that ( i ) we do not remove any outgoing edge of a reticulation node , and ( ii ) for any tree node , if an outgoing edge of it is removed , the other outgoing edge enters another tree node and thus has never not been removed . now , we show that is a subdivision of a binary reticulation visible network . since we had deleted an incoming edge for a reticulation node if it is not visible , all the remaining reticulation nodes are visible . is reticulation visible . we can also show that there are no two internally disjoint paths from a common tree node to a common reticulation node in which each internal node is of degree 2 , implying that is a subdivision of a binary reticulation visible network . assume on the contrary there are two internally disjoint path and between and such that their internal nodes are all of degree 2 . if neither nor is a single edge , then the two children of in and are both not visible , contradicting that is a stable - child network . therefore , either or is a single edge from and . without loss of generality , we may assume that is equal to the edge . according to the three rules which we used to remove the edges in , if an incoming edge of a node is removed , its child in is visible in . this implies that does not contain a path consisting of two or more degree-2 nodes that are not visible in . therefore , has exactly one internal node . if is a tree node in , then , we removed an outgoing edge of according to either the second or third case . in the former case , we remove at the same time . in the later case , does not exist in . this is impossible . when is a reticulation node , we removed an incoming edge of it . again , the edge does not exist in in each possible case , a contradiction . we have proved that is a subdivision of a binary network . let be the subnetwork obtained after the removal of the edges in . is a subdivision of a reticulation visible network . by theorem , there exist a set of paths such that ( i ) is a subtree of with the same leaves and ( ii ) all the internal nodes in each path in are of degree 2 . again , we use to denote the trivial paths in , where denotes the trivial path starting with . as in the last section , a path in is called a non - cross path if its start and end nodes are both in for some ; it is called a cross path otherwise . let be a path in . \\(a ) every internal node in is not visible in . \\(b ) if is a non - cross path , it is simply an edge . \\(c ) if is a cross path and ends at a node in the trivial path , every node between the start node of and in is not visible in . \\(d ) if is a cross path and there is a non - cross path jumping over it , then either is an edge or the start node of is the parent of the end node of in . \\(a ) and ( b ) are essentially the restatement of the fact ( a ) and ( c ) in lemma . \\(c ) let be a node between the start node of and in . for any leaf that is not below in , is a path that does not pass and hence . for any leaf below in , the path avoids , as is the start node of in a trivial path different from . hence , is not visible in . \\(d ) by ( b ) , is simply an edge in . let start at a node . if neither nor is a single edge , the two children of in and are both not visible , contradicting that is stable - child . let be a reticulation node and not visible in . then , a revealed sc - edge was removed from to obtain from . we define the cost of to be : recall that . we can define the cost of a cross path from to as follows : we further charge the cost of to the trivial path to which belongs and call it the weight of , written . if there is no cross path entering , the weight of is set to be 0 . as for nearly - stable networks , we have that for an internal node with degree-3 in , we still use and to denote the trivial paths leaving and to denote the trivial path entering . for each internal node of degree 3 in , \\(a ) , . \\(b ) . \\(c ) if and , then . moreover , assume is the start node of and . then . \\(d ) if , then and . \\(a ) we will only prove that . let denote the cross path sending at a node in . let be the start node of in a trivial path different from . note that . if there is no non -

cross edge jumping over , is either in or is below in . the former implies that is not visible , whereas the latter implies that is not visible . this contradicts that both and are visible in . since is an internal node between and in , then is the parent of in . by the fact ( a ) and ( c ) of lemma , each internal node in or is not visible . thus , or is an edge . otherwise , the two children of are not visible , contradicting is stable -

cross edge jumping over , otherwise is not visible . second , a child of in is not visible , and so the cross path is simply an edge . otherwise by the fact ( a ) of lemma , the two children of are both not visible in . by ( b ) of lemma , either or is an edge in . if is the parent of in , then according to eqn .  . by ( a ) , . if is the parent of , and according to the remark at the end of the proof of ( a ) . taken together , both facts imply that , which contradicts the assumption that . * case 3*. is below and is below ( figure d ) . this case is impossible since there is a cycle in , contradicting is acyclic . to sum up , implies that either ( i ) or ( ii ) is true . but in both cases , if we let be either or any internal node in , the set of reticulations are below and satisfies the condition in lemma . therefore , and any internal node of are not visible . there are two observations from this result . first , because there is no cross path that ends at .

{"article": "in a database containing a solution of the 3d incompressible navier - stokes ( ns ) equations is presented . the equations were solved numerically with a standard pseudo - spectral simulation in a periodic domain , using a real space grid of grid points . a large - scale body force drives a turbulent flow with a taylor microscale based reynolds number . out of this solution , snapshots were stored , spread out evenly over a large eddy turnover time . more on the simulation and on accessing the data can be found at http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu . in practical terms , we have easy access to the turbulent velocity field and pressure at every point in space and time . one usual way of visualising a turbulent velocity field is to plot vorticity isosurfaces see for instance the plots from . the resulting pictures are usually very `` crowded '' , in the sense that there are many intertwined thin vortex tubes , generating an extremely complex structure . in fact , the picture of the entire dataset from looks extremely noisy and it is arguably not very informative about the turbulent dynamics . in this work , we follow a different approach . first of all , we use the alternate quantity first introduced in . secondly , the tool being used has the option of displaying data only inside clearly defined domains of 3d space . we can exploit this facility to investigate the multiscale character of the turbulent cascade . because vorticity is dominated by the smallest available scales in the velocity , we can visualize vorticity at scale by the curl of the velocity box - filtered at scale . we follow a simple procedure : * we filter the velocity field , using a box filter of size , and we generate semitransparent surfaces delimitating the domains where ; * we filter the velocity field , using a box filter of size , and we generate surfaces delimitating the domains where , but only if these domains are contained in one of the domains from ; and this procedure can be used iteratively with several scales ( we use at most 3 scales , since the images become too complex for more levels ) . additionally , we wish sometimes to keep track of the relative orientation of the vorticity vectors at the different scales . for this purpose we employ a special coloring scheme for the isosurfaces : for each point of the surface , we compute the cosine of the angle between the filtered vorticity and the filtered vorticity : the surface is green for , yellow for and red for , following a continuous gradient between these three for intermediate values . the opening montage of vortex tubes is very similar to the traditional visualisation : a writhing mess of vortices . upon coarse - graining , additional structure is revealed . the large - scale vorticity , which appears as transparent gray , is also arranged in tubes . as a next step , we remove all the fine - scale vorticity outside the large - scale tubes . the color scheme for the small - scale vorticity is that described earlier , with green representing alignment with the large - scale vorticity and red representing anti - alignment . clearly , most of the small - scale vorticity is aligned with the vorticity of the large - scale tube that contains it . we then remove the fine - grained vorticity and pan out to see that the coarse - grained vortex tubes are also intricately tangled and intertwined . introducing a yet larger scale , we repeat the previous operations . the relative orientation properties of the vorticity at these two scales is similar to that observed earlier . next we visualize the vortex structures at all three scales simultaneously , one inside the other . it is clear that the small vortex tubes are transported by the larger tubes that contain them . however , this is not just a passive advection . the small - scale vortices are as well being distorted by the large - scale motions . to focus on this more clearly , we now render just the two smallest scales . one can observe the small - scale vortex tubes being both stretched and twisted by the large - scale motions . the stretching of small vortex tubes by large ones was suggested by orszag and borue as being the basic mechanism of the turbulent energy cascade . as the small - scale tubes are stretched out , they are `` spun up '' and gain kinetic energy . here , this phenomenon is clearly revealed . the twisting of small - scale vortices by large - scale screw motions has likewise been associated to helicity cascade . the video thus allows us to view the turbulent cascade in progress . next we consider the corresponding view with three levels of vorticity simultaneously . since the ratio of scales is here 1:15:49 we are observing less than two decades of the turbulent cascade . one must imagine the complexity of a very extended inertial range with many scales of motion . not all of the turbulent dynamics is tube within tube . in our last scene we visualize in the right half domain all the small - scale vortices , and in the left domain only the small - scale vortices inside the larger scale ones . in the right half , the viewer can observe stretching of the small - scale vortex structures taking place externally to the large - scale tubes . the spin - up of these vortices must contribute likewise to the turbulent energy cascade . 6ifxundefined ifx#1 ifnum # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop secondoftwosanitize@url + 12$12 & 12#1212 12%12@startlink@endlink@bib@innerbibempty link:\\doibase 10.1080/14685240802376389 @noop * *  , in http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs all.jsp?arnumber=1592886  p. @noop ,  link:\\doibase 10.1017/s0022112097008306 http://journals.cambridge.org / production / action / cjogetfulltext?fulltextid=4% 00523", "summary": "the jhu turbulence database can be used with a state of the art visualisation tool to generate high quality link : anc / dfdsubmissionquarterres.mpg . in this work we investigate the classical idea that smaller structures in turbulent flows , while engaged in their own internal dynamics , are advected by the larger structures . they are not advected undistorted , however . we see instead that the small scale structures are sheared and twisted by the larger scales . this illuminates the basic mechanisms of the turbulent cascade ."}
{"article": "in recent years electron transfer ( et ) between molecular adsorbates and semiconductor nanomaterials and surfaces has been subject of much research . the injection of an electron into the conduction band is a prototype reaction for a lot of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical interfacial processes such as photography , solar energy conversion , quantum dot devices , etc . interfacial et between discrete molecular levels and a conducting surface is the simplest of all surface reactions : it involves only the exchange of an electron , and so no bonds are broken . the ultrafast nature of the charge injection from adsorbed molecules to the conduction band of semiconductor surfaces was shown in recent experiments . the theoretical description of such experiments demands an adequate treatment of the et dynamics to be able to describe short time - scale phenomena such as coherences . this can be done within the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) description used in the present contribution . recently the electron injection from a chromophore to a semiconductor conduction band was described using the time - dependent schrdinger equation , thus neglecting relaxation processes . the neglect of relaxation processes was motivated by the experimental finding that injected electrons relax only within 150 fs in the perylene - tio system . here we include relaxation to be able to treat a larger class of experiments where , for example , the adsorbed molecule is surrounded by a liquid environment , and longer times . in the rdm theory the full system is divided into a relevant system part and a heat bath . therefore the total hamiltonian consists of three terms the system part , the bath part , and the system - bath interaction : the rdm is obtained from the density matrix of the full system by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the environment . this reduction together with a second - order perturbative treatment of and the markov approximation leads to the redfield equation : + { \\mathcal r } \\rho = { \\mathcal l } \\rho . \\ ] ] in this equation denotes the redfield tensor . if one assumes bilinear system - bath coupling with system part and bath part one can take advantage of the following decomposition : + + . \\ ] ] the operator can be written in the form where is the operator in the interaction representation . the system bath interaction is taken to be linear in the reaction coordinate as well as in the bath coordinates . neither the rotating wave nor the secular approximation have been invoked . the so - called diabatic damping approximation which has numerical advantages is not used because it could lead to wrong results in the present system studied . in the following we direct our attention to et between an excited molecular state and a conduction band . the hamiltonian modeling this system consists of the ground and one excited state of the molecule and a quasi - continuum describing the conduction band together with one vibrational coordinate here can be equal to for the ground state , for the excited state , and for the quasi - continuum . as in ref . we choose the frequency of the vibrational mode to be . the coupling between the excited state and the continuum states is assumed to be constant : . a box - shaped uniform density of states is used . instead of modeling the excitation from the ground state explicitly we assume a -pulse . the excited state potential energy surface is shifted 0.1 along the reaction coordinate with respect to the ground state potential energy surface . this results in an initial vibrational wave packet on the excited state with significant population in the lowest 4 - 5 vibrational states . the shift between the excited state energy surface and the continuum parabola is 0.2 . the thermal bath is characterized by its spectral density . because all system oscillators have the same frequency the coupling to the bath can be given by one parameter in the diabatic damping approximation . denoting the effective mass of the harmonic oscillator by the strength of the damping is chosen as . to be able to study the effects of dissipation we do not model the quasi - continuum with such a large number of electronic states as in ref . . in that work a band of width 2 ev was described using an energy difference of 2.5 mev leading to 801 electronic surfaces . these calculations are already demanding using wave packet propagation but almost impossible using direct density matrix propagation . for doing such a large system one would have to use the monte carlo wave function scheme . we use a much simpler model and describe only that part of the conduction band which really takes part in the injection process . the total width of the conduction band may be significantly larger . in the following , a band of width 0.75 ev is treated with 31 electronic surfaces . in each of these electronic states five vibrational states are taken into account . we are aware that this is only a minimal model but hope that it catches the effects of dissipation on the electron injection process . here we look at two different populations arising in the process of electron injection . the time - dependent population of the electronic states in the conduction band is calculated as the sum over the vibrational levels of each electronic surface . as a second quantity we look at the time - dependent population of the vibrational levels of the excited molecular state . these two probability distributions give some hints on the effect of dissipation . figure 1 shows the electronic population for the quasi - continuum , i.e. the probability distribution of the injected electron , versus the energy of the conduction band . as described above , the four lowest vibrational states are populated significantly at . the structure arising in the upper panel of fig . 1 was already explained by ramakrishna et al . it can be estimated using the golden rule . the electronic probabilities in the quasi - continuum are given as where is the initial vibronic distribution in the excited state and and are the vibronic parts of the wave packet in the excited and quasi - continuum states , respectively . the energy denotes the middle of the band . turning on dissipation two effects can be seen . first , the vibrational populations in the excited state of the molecule no longer only decay into the quasi - continuum states but also relax within the excited state ( see fig . 2 ) . second , the vibrational populations also relax within the quasi - continuum states . the recurrences back into the excited state become much smaller . only those parts of the wave packet which are still high enough in energy can go back to the molecule . in summary , we extended the work by ramakrishna , willig , and may by including relaxation processes into the description of electron injection into the conduction band of a semiconductor . this will , at least , become important for modeling electron injection in the presence of a fluid surrounding the attached molecule .", "summary": "electron injection from an adsorbed molecule to the substrate ( heterogeneous electron transfer ) is studied . one reaction coordinate is used to model this process . the surface phonons and/or the electron -

( 1997a , b ) accounted for the observations with an empirical model in which the inner disk region `` disappears '' in the low count rate state , and is then replenished on a viscous time scale . the parameters of their model are : the inner disk radius , ; the corresponding effective temperature of the disk , and an ad - hoc non - thermal power law ( which is possibly produced in the disk corona ) . although no detailed physical model for the instability was given , very interesting patterns of behavior for and , as well as several other observables , were deduced from the data , and the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter was found to be unexpectedly low ( which may mean that the standard viscosity prescription is invalid for this source ) . the rather small values of found by these authors can be used to discriminate between different models of the accretion flow in grs 1915 ( see appendix and ) . abramowicz , chen & taam ( 1995 ) suggested a model for the low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) observed in selected x - ray binaries , in which a corona above the standard accretion disk leads to a mild oscillatory behavior . with some modifications , this model could reasonably be expected to account for at least some of the temporal variability in grs 1915 + 105 as well ( taam , chen & swank 1997 ) . however , it appears to us that the analysis of abramowicz et al .

( 1997 ) contains an error in the heating / cooling equation for the disk which , when corrected , constrains their model to have the same stability characteristics as a standard shakura - sunyaev disk , and is therefore unlikely to explain the grs 1915 + 105 observations ( see appendix a ) . we show more generally in appendix that neither a hot central region , nor an advection - dominated flow , nor a `` slim '' accretion disk are compatible with the observations of grs 1915 + 105 . ( `` slim '' accretion disk theory was developed in the most detail by abramowicz et al . 1988 ; it is similar to a standard thin shakura - sunyaev disk , except for the energy equation , which incorporates the radial advection of energy into the black hole . ) in this paper , we attempt to undertake a more systematic study of the variability patterns in grs 1915 + 105 within the context of the `` cold diskhot corona '' picture . in we present a general discussion that will guide us in our selection of a novel ( though somewhat ad - hoc ) prescription for the viscosity in cases where the radiation pressure is substantial  . the details of our numerical algorithm to solve the time - dependent disk equations with the use of this new viscosity prescription are given in . in , we present the results of our time - dependent disk calculations . the calculated light curves are found to agree qualitatively with many observational features of grs 1915 + 105 . in particular , the characteristic cycle times and duty cycles are in reasonable agreement with the observations . moreover , the trend in the cycle time with the average accretion rate , has the correct sense . however , there are important disagreements as well . we therefore introduce a more elaborate model in , where , in accordance with the observations ( e.g. , mirabel & rodrigues 1994 ) , the inner disk is allowed to expel some of its energy in the form of a non - steady jet . we assume that the ejected energy is not observed in x - rays , but rather that it ultimately produces radio emission . we show that this more elaborate model agrees with the grs 1915 + 105 observations much better , perhaps indicating that we are finally developing a zeroth order understanding of the geometry and the most important processes in this enigmatic source . in we discuss our results in the light of the earlier work on grs 1915 , and in we summarize our conclusions . figure 1 shows four examples of typical x - ray light curves from grs 1915 obtained with the rxte satellite ( see , e.g. , morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) . it appears that the source undergoes a limit - cycle type of instability ; the cycle times in panels ( a ) ( d ) are 2400 , 60 , 1200 , and 800 sec , respectively . within the cycles shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) there appear yet other quasi - regular oscillations of still shorter time scale . the shortest time scale over which a substantial change in the x - ray flux occurs is 5 sec . we will associate the longer cycles with the viscous time scales of the inner accretion disk , whereas the more rapid behavior will be related to the thermal time scale . the x - ray spectrum of grs 1915 + 105 varies systematically with x - ray intensity ; usually the spectral hardness is strongly correlated ( or anti - correlated ) with intensity ( e.g. , belloni et al . 1997a , b ; taam et al . 1997 ; muno et al . more specifically , the spectrum is typically found to be composed of a multi - temperature disk component , hereafter the thermal component \" , and a power - law component with a varying spectral index . finally , the source exhibits a wide range of qpos with central frequencies in the range of 0.01 - 10 hz . the amplitude and frequency of the qpos appear to be strongly correlated with the spectral state of grs 1915 + 105 ( chen et al . 1997 ; muno et al . 1999 ) . the idea of using a modified viscosity law to test time - dependent phenomena in accretion disks around black holes is not new ( e.g. , taam & lin 1984 ; chen & taam 1994 ; and further references below in this section ) . but let us examine in global terms how the various disk configurations relate to the behavior of grs 1915 + 105 in particular . in geometrically thin disks the advection of energy is not important . the viscous time scale is much longer than both the thermal and hydrostatic time scales ( see frank et al . 1992 ) , unless which is unlikely for this source ( belloni et al . 1997b ) . in this context , then , the equations for vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance between viscous heating and radiative losses should be valid . it is customary and instructive to plot the disk effective temperature versus the column density to investigate the stability properties of disks . in the one zone limit , the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction is where is the mass of the black hole , is the scale height and is the radial distance from the central object . the gas pressure is given by ( for hydrogen rich material ) , where is the mid - plane temperature , is the proton mass , and the radiation pressure is . the energy balance equation is given by where is the vertical radiation flux , is the optical depth of the disk , , and is the radiative opacity ( assumed to be dominated by electron scattering opacity ) , is the stress tensor ( see , e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky , 14.5 ) , and is the keplerian angular frequency . as we said earlier , in the standard shakura - sunyaev formulation , the stress tensor is proportional to the total pressure , we can now combine equations   to eliminate the variable h and thereby derive an expression to generate the curve for any given viscosity . in figure  we show several illustrative curves to help motivate our selection of . the dashed curve represents the track that the standard shakura - sunyaev theory with const produces . such a model is thermally and viscously unstable when the slope of the curve becomes negative ( e.g. , frank et al . 1992 ) , which might be a desirable result in the view of the instabilities observed in grs 1915 + 105 . however , the observed light curves require a quasi - stable accretion mode for the high - luminosity state as well , which is not predicted by the standard theory ( see also the end of app . b ) . this suggestion ( already discussed by belloni et al . 1997a , b and taam et al . 1997 ) is motivated by the fact that in some cases the upper luminosity state of the source lasts even longer than the low state , which is presumably the stable gas - pressure - dominated branch . a - relation that has a stable high - luminosity state is shown in figure ( , solid curve ) . it has the characteristic `` s - shape '' , familiar from the studies of the thermal ionization instability in accretion disks ( e.g. , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , bath & pringle 1982 , cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 , and frank et al . 1992 , 5.8 ) or from studies of radiation - pressure driven instabilities by , e.g. , taam & lin ( 1984 ) and chen & taam ( 1994 ) . it is well known that parts of an s - curve that have a negative slope are unstable . in short , when the - relation produces an s - curve , the unstable region of the disk oscillates between the two stable branches of the solution , which gives rise to the high and low luminosity states . so far , we have not considered flows where advection is important . as adafs ( advection dominated accretion flows ) will be discussed in , here we concentrate on the slim accretion disks ( abramowicz et al . these flows have a stable high solution even with the standard viscosity prescription due to the additional cooling ( energy transport ) via advection . however , the s - curves produced by these models have the upper stable branch for only ( see , e.g. , see fig . 2 in chen & taam 1993 ) . in other words , if one were to position the upper stable branch of the slim accretion disks on our figure  , then it would look similar to the corresponding stable branch of the solid curve in the figure , except that it would be positioned higher by a factor of about ( at a given ) . thus , if one assumes that an unstable part of the disk makes a transition from the lower bend in the s - curve upwards to the stable branch , and that remains approximately constant during this process , then the accretion rate in the inner disk must increase by as much a factor of a few hundred to a thousand to reach the stable advective regime . while this may not be a problem in terms of the luminosity output , since most of the energy is advected inwards and the luminosity of the disk saturates at ( see fig . 1 in szuszkiewicz , malkan & abramowicz 1996 ) , the light curves produced will always be very spiky and the duty cycle of the high state is always much smaller than the values of that are often seen in grs 1915 + 105 . the physical cause of the spiky behavior is the vast difference between the accretion rates in the high and low states . as we will discuss later in , an outburst starts because `` too much '' mass ( column density ) has been accumulated above the maximum possible stable value of ( i.e. , at the lower bend of the s - curve in figure ) . if the high stable state accretion rate is very much larger than the low state accretion rate , it then takes only a very short time in the high state to remove this excess mass from the inner disk . in other words , it would not be possible to maintain mass conservation if the accretion rate persisted at the high state for very long . this is indeed seen from the temperature curves computed for slim disks by szuszkiewicz & miller ( 1998 , see their figures 7 - 9 ) . therefore , we believe that slim disks are not likely to adequately account for the behavior of grs 1915 + 105 , at least not if one seeks a theory capable of explaining all of the variability in this source . the geometry in our unstable disk model is that of a standard shakura - sunyaev configuration ( except for the viscosity law ) overlayed with a hot corona . here we describe the set of equations that we use to follow the temporal evolution of this disk ; these equations are applicable to any local viscosity law . a discussion of the viscosity itself is deferred until . the standard euler equations for conservation of mass and angular momentum in the disk ( see , e.g. , frank et al . 1992 ) can be combined in the usual way to yield the equation describing the evolution of the surface density : \\right\\}\\ , , \\ ] ] where all of the variables , except for , were defined in the previous section . here is the viscosity that is related to by = . the time - dependent energy equation includes the heating and cooling terms of equation  , but must also be able to take into account large radial gradients of temperature , and therefore includes a number of additional terms . the form of the energy equation that we use follows the formalism of abramowicz et al . ( 1995 ) with some modifications , and is given by \\nonumber \\\\ = f^{+ } - f^{- } - { 2\\over r}\\ , { \\partial(r f r h)\\over \\partial r } + j , \\ ] ] where , is the ratio of the radiation to the gas pressure , is the ratio of specific heats  and is given in abramowicz et al . ( the radial velocity is given by the standard expression ( eq . 5.7 of frank et al . 1992 ) : . \\ ] ] the terms on the left hand side of equation  represent the full time derivative ( e.g. , ) of the gas entropy , while the terms on the right are the viscous heating , the energy flux in the vertical direction , the diffusion of radiation in the radial direction , and the viscous diffusion of thermal energy . following cannizzo ( 1993 ; and references cited therein ) , we take ] . this functional form allows the -parameter to be roughly in the inner disk region  , and to be for . the presence of these two time scales is obvious just from a perusal of the resulting light curves . oscillations of the inner disk produce the precursor seen before each major outburst in fig .  . its relative magnitude is small because the amount of excess mass stored in the inner disk is small compared to that in the outer disk . furthermore , in the simulations the inner disk decouples from the outer one only at the beginning of the outburst , not at the end as is seen in the grs 1915 + 105 data . this is due to the fact that once the outer disk makes a transition to the high state , the large mass supply to the inner disk forces the latter to go into the high state as well and remain there . in summary , varying the -parameter with radial distance does not appear to be a viable explanation for the rapid chaotic oscillations seen in the data which are superposed on the more regular long time scale disk evolution . an alternative way of explaining the fast oscillations could have been provided if the heating / cooling fronts stall and are reflected back as cooling / heating fronts . this behavior was observed in simulations of the classical thermal ionization disk instability by cannizzo ( 1993 , see text above his equation 5 ) , where it happened to be an unwanted result . however , we have not been able to see such stalled transition fronts ( except for the case presented in fig . ) , which should not be too surprising , due to the fact that the underlying physics of the ionization instability and the one explored in this paper are vastly different , and one does not expect a direct correspondence between these two instabilities . although we will not present any light curves , we should mention that we have also attempted to allow the fraction to be a function of , since the transition from to means a substantial change in the physical conditions in the disk . our hope was that the freedom in choosing might help to reproduce the disk flickering . however , all our attempts in this regard ( with decreasing or increasing across the transition in ) have been unsuccessful . although our model is able to reproduce a number of the general trends seen in the light curve of grs 1915 + 105 , the rise / fall time scales are always shorter in the data than they are in the simulations . the fast rises and falls are perhaps the reason why the profile of an outburst in some of the actual light curves of grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. , panel ( c ) of fig . ) is reminiscent of a square - wave like shape rather than the rounded shapes that an outburst has in the simulations ( see fig . d ) . the difference between our simulations and the data appears important enough to us to require the addition of a new feature to our model and test whether it can bring the theory closer to the observations . the following considerations have guided us in choosing the additional ingredient in our model . the speed with which the hot state propagates outward in the accretion disk is equal to the speed of the transition wave , which was studied analytically by , e.g. , meyer ( 1984 ) and numerically by menou , hameury & stehle ( 1998 ) . both of these studies find that the propagation speed of the transition wave is . the time scale for the transition front to traverse an unstable region of size r is , i.e. , the transitions in the disk actually take times longer than the thermal time scale of the outermost part of the unstable disk region . this is the reason why the rises and falls take too long in the simulations compared to the data . however , notice that during the initial stage of the transition from the low to the high state , the luminosity rises quite rapidly in the simulations ( see fig d ) , at a rate probably as fast as that seen in the data . now , if some physical process were to `` cut '' the simulated light curves at , say , , so that anything emitted by the disk above this value is not seen by the observer , then the outburst profile would be much more consistent with the data . to find a process able to `` cut '' the light curve , we should recall that powerful plasma ejections are known to occur in grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. , mirabel and rodriguez 1994 ) . recently , eikenberry et al . ( 1998 ) , mirabel et al . ( 1997 ) and fender & pooley ( 1998 ) have shown that there exists a strong link between the x - ray emission and emission in the infrared and radio frequencies . the radio and infrared emission is attributed to plasma ejection events taking place in the innermost part of the disk . the minimum power deposited at the base of the jet ( that may consist of individual ejection events ) was found ( e.g. , gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 ) to be as high as few erg sec for the event first discovered by mirabel and rodriguez ( 1994 ) . during other observations ( e.g. , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , the radio fluxes were a factor of lower than the ones observed by mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 ) , which still may require few erg sec ejected into the jet , which is as large as the largest x - ray luminosities produced by the source . thus , if one were to model these plasma ejections in the framework of our model , one would have to allow for a significant portion of the accretion energy to be diverted into the jet . from here on , we will therefore assume that the total accretion disk power consists of two parts : the first is the x - ray luminosity , that is equal to the sum of the thermal disk and non - thermal coronal luminosities ; and the second part is the `` jet power '' , i.e. , the energy ejected into the jet . for simplicity we further assume that the jet power is not seen in x - rays , and appears only in the radio or other non - x - ray wavebands . as before , the locally produced total disk power is given by equation  , where we will again suppose that . the jet luminosity is then where is the fraction of power that escapes from the disk into the jet . this parameter  may be a constant , or it may be a function of local disk conditions or a function of some global variable , e.g. , the total disk power . since the importance of advection relative to the radiative cooling is roughly given by the ratio , and since according to our discussion in appendix in this source , the advection of energy is not important in our model . thus , the observed x - ray power will consist from the disk power ( fraction of the total disk power ) and the coronal luminosity which is given by an equation analogous to equation  except with a parameter instead of inside the integral . to eliminate any ambiguities of our approach , we note that the accretion power is divided among the disk , the corona , and the jet as , and , respectively . we should also mention that the amount of mass carried away by the jet is small compared to that accreted into the black hole , so we neglect the former in the mass conservation ( eq . ) . the point here is rather simple : if the ultimate source of the jet power is the underlying accretion disk , then to produce one relativistic proton in the jet , many protons in the disk must transfer their gravitational energy ( which is small compared with their rest mass ) to that one jet proton . these protons will therefore have to sink into the black hole in order to send one proton into the jet . more precisely , the mass outflow rate is , where few is the terminal bulk lorenz factor of the jet . this is to be compared with the accretion rate through the disk , that is equal to , where is the `` radiative '' efficiency of the disk and is the total disk power . accordingly , since . this estimate is quite conservative . for example , if the jet power is dominated by magnetic fields or by electron - positron pairs , then the mass carried away in the jet is even smaller . a similar consideration allows us to neglect the angular momentum outflow from the disk into the jet . we point out however that the latter approximation depends on the model of the jet ; if the jet particles actually gain a considerable amount of the angular momentum as they are streaming away from the disk , then the torque exerted by the jet on the disk may become non - negligible . we plan to explore these effects in future work . eikenberry et al . ( 1998 ) found that the ejection events were absent in the low state and started at the onset and during the high state . we thus will accept a parameterization of such that it is close to zero when the disk is in the low state , and it is relatively large ( but still smaller than unity , of course ) when the disk is in the high state . we now explore three different illustrative prescriptions for the function to show the possible effects of the disk power being diverted into a jet . let us assume that the fraction is described by the following ( somewhat arbitrarily chosen ) function : where is the total power of the source in terms of its eddington luminosity . this equation is qualitatively reasonable since one expects particles to be ejected from the disk when the luminosity approaches ( and then exceeds ) the eddington limit . while the radiation may not be the ultimate driving power of the jet , the radiation pressure can cause more matter to be ejected and possibly produce stronger jets . we show in figure  the resulting x - ray light curve ( solid line ) and the total disk luminosity ( represented by a dashed curve ; scaled down by the factor of 3 to fit the figure ) for an accretion rate . note that the overall luminosity curve is the same as we would have obtained with our basic model for the same choice of and , but with no jet ejections ( see & ) . the shape of the outburst indeed becomes more like a square - wave , and thus the rises and falls appear to be sharper than they were for the model with , thus making it possible to reproduce this feature of the observed light - curves ( in particular , panel ( c ) of fig . ) . as a second example , we test the following prescription for the jet power : ( this prescription , in contrast to the one given by eq . ] , was chosen among several that we tested to reproduce the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig . ] simultaneously as described in ) . the corresponding x - ray light curve and the total luminosity of the system are shown in figure  . one notices that the profile of the outburst in x - rays is now inverted with respect to the actual disk power . when the disk produces most of the energy output , the x - ray light curve actually has a local minimum , since most of the energy is ejected into the jet during that time . this effect may be responsible for the `` strange '' shape of the outburst seen in panel ( d ) of fig  . as a final example we present a sequence of light curves produced by our model with a fixed prescription for the jet energy fraction and with the accretion rate being the only parameter that is varied . the functional dependence of is again given by eq .  . further , motivated by the fact that the x - ray emission can fluctuate wildly when it is in the high state ( see fig . 1 ) , whereas it does not fluctuate as much in the low luminosity state , we allow the fraction carried away from the disk other than by the usual radiation diffusion to fluctuate around some mean . numerically , the -factor will now contain a variable part , such that : where is the constant part fixed at the previously selected value of , is a random number distributed uniformly between -1 and + 1 ( a new value of is randomly chosen every 3 seconds ) , and is a function of radius such that it is unity in the inner disk and it approaches zero for . the latter radial dependence is introduced simply to avoid complications with the outer boundary condition at , where we set the disk structure to be that given by the gas - dominated shakura - sunyaev configuration with a constant ( see ) . the shape of the function is almost completely irrelevant for the resulting light curves as long as is large , since most of the disk power is liberated in the inner disk region . finally , although the second term on the right hand side of the equation  appears to be complicated and model - dependent , its presence is not required and serves only to make the light curves look somewhat more random . none of the final conclusions of this paper depend on the particular choice for the random part in . figure  shows the resulting x - ray light curves for four different accretion rates . it is worthwhile comparing figure  with figure  , in which the plasma ejections and random fluctuations in were absent . the case with the accretion rate just above ( i.e. , panel c in fig . ) has not been affected as strongly as that with the higher accretion rate ; this is of course due to the fact that little energy is ejected in the jet in the former case compared with the latter . yet panels ( a ) and ( c ) do look more chaotic , which is entirely due to the fluctuating part in the fraction ( see eq .  . analyzing panels ( b ) and ( d ) of this figure , one notices that it turns out to be possible to reproduce both the sharp square - wave like pattern ( c ) and the `` inverted '' pattern ( d ) of figure 1 with the same prescription for . it is the same process , i.e. , the plasma ejection , that allows our model to better reproduce the data ( panels and of fig . 1 ) ; the only difference being that in panel ( d ) the ejected fraction of the disk energy is much greater than in panel ( b ) . for the completeness of presentation , we also plot the jet power with a dotted curve in fig .  corresponding to the simulation presented in panel ( b ) of fig .  . given the relatively good agreement between the model and the observations of grs 1915 + 105 , we believe that we now have a better handle on the key characteristics of accretion in this source . while we feel less confident about the origin of the s - curve in the space , we think that the geometry of the accretion flow in grs 1915 + 105 is that of a geometrically thin and optically thick flow ( see ) . most of the x - ray luminosity is produced in an optically thin corona , that can cover the entire inner disk or consist of localized transient magnetic flares ( e.g. , haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ; nayakshin & melia 1997 ; nayakshin 1998 ) . in the latter case , the fraction of the power transported from the disk into the corona and the jet must be thought of as a time averaged variable . further , we believe that plasma ejection events must be an integral part of the accretion process , and are likely to be the result of an excessively large radiation pressure . we will discuss this issue in a broader context in . belloni et al . ( 1997a , b ) were the first to fit the spectrum in grs 1915 + 105 with a two - component model , consisting of a multi - temperature disk - blackbody with a variable inner disk radius plus a power - law . very importantly , these authors found that most of the complex spectral variability can be explained by a rapid change in the disk inner radius and a corresponding change in the temperature of the disk at . they have also shown a correlation between the disk filling time scale and the inferred radius of the inner disk . our results are qualitatively similar to the framework of the disk instability discussed by belloni et al . for grs 1915 + 105 since in the low state the inner disk is quite dim ( up to a factor of 10 - 30 , see figure ) compared with what it should have been if the disk were stable . thus , the inner part of the disk can be largely unobservable and can be said to be `` missing '' . at the same time , in the high state , the inner disk is brighter than its equilibrium luminosity by typically a factor of a few , which may make the outer part of the disk ( that is stable and so has just the `` normal '' flux ) seem comparatively dim . under these conditions , it may be non - trivial to distinguish observationally between a disk where the temperature is a continuous function of r  and a disk where the temperature is lower than expected in the outer part of the disk , since the outer disk carries a small fraction of the overall luminosity . in addition , the inner disk is never completely empty of mass in our model , although the difference between the inner disk surface density in the high versus that in the low state can be a factor of few to 10 ( see fig . c ) . note that as defined by belloni et al . should be identified with the largest radius reached by the heating wave in our simulations . more specifically , during the high state , should be defined as the radius of innermost stable orbit , whereas during the low state it is approximately equal to the largest radius in the disk in which ( i.e. , for fig . ) . our values of are in general much larger than those obtained by belloni et al . the value of inferred from the observations could be larger if one were to fit the grs 1915 + 105 emission with a more complicated ( and likely more realistic ) spectrum than a multi- temperature blackbody appropriate for a shakura - sunyaev disk . moreover , for the high accretion rates observed in this source , the disk may become effectively optically thin and thus radiate as a modified ( rather than a pure ) blackbody ( see discussion in taam et al . since blackbody emission produces the maximum flux for a given temperature , the modified emission would require a larger . finally , the values of obtained by us would presumably be smaller for a kerr black hole . we plan to address this question in the future . belloni et al . ( 1997b ) showed that the outburst duration is proportional to the duration of the preceding quiescent state , but there is no correlation between the former and the quiescent time after the burst . profiles of outbursts in our model are rather regular , so we believe we see a correlation among these three quantities in contrast to the belloni et al . results . on the other hand , in many observations ( other than the one presented in belloni et al . 1997b ) grs 1915 + 105 does not show a good correlation between the duration of the outburst and the preceding quiescent phase ( t. belloni 1999 , private communication ) . we have systematically analyzed the physical principles underlying the behavior of grs 1915 + 105 , and have arrived at several important conclusions regarding the nature of the time - dependent accretion flow in this system . as discussed in appendix , geometrically thick advection - dominated flows are unacceptable for this source , since they would produce burst - like instabilities with a very small duty cycle compared to those seen in the data , for accretion rates smaller than the eddington value . to produce outbursts as long as seconds , geometrically thick accretion flows must have implausibly small values of . however , if the accretion rate is highly super - eddington , then a thick adaf disk could yield outbursts with a reasonable duty cycle  . but since the viscous time scale for geometrically thick disks is as short as the thermal one , their light curves would be rather smooth which again contradicts the data ( see , e.g. , panels c & d of fig . it is also unclear how the observation ( e.g. , belloni et al . 1997a , b ; muno , morgan & remillard 1999 ) that the disk extends down to the innermost stable orbit during the high state can be reconciled with the structure of a geometrically thick , hot and optically thin flow . for these reasons , the standard cold accretion disk with a modified viscosity law , a corona , and plasma ejections seems to be the only reasonable choice . as we have shown in this paper , this geometry indeed allows one to obtain rather good general agreement between the theory and observations , and to understand particular features of the light curves in terms of fundamental physical processes . nevertheless , a critical reader may question whether the relatively large number of parameters introduced by us in this work allows us to pin - point actual values of these parameters . we believe that the answer to this question is `` yes '' , because spectral constraints , used very sparingly here , may prove to be quite restrictive in future studies . for example , we have shown only the total luminosity light curves in this paper , whereas the data also contain a wealth of information about the spectral evolution in grs 1915 + 105 ( belloni et al . 1997 ; muno et al . 1999 ) . if future observations also provide more examples of the disk - jet connection ( e.g. , eikenberry et al . 1998 ) , then we have a means of constraining the dependence of both and the total fraction on the disk luminosity . further , one should also attempt to explore the fact that other transient and persistent black hole sources do not exhibit instabilities similar to grs 1915 + 105 , at least not to the same extreme degree . thus , putting all these observational and theoretical constraints together may be quite effective in limiting the theoretical possibilities for the instability and the coronal and jet activity . as an example of the need for a detailed study of the spectra and qpos in the context of our model , we point out the following . from the results of muno et al . ( 1999 ) it appears that qpos are present when the power - law component dominates the spectrum , which usually happens in the low state ( `` low '' means the lower count rate ) . further , these authors find that for the burst profiles similar to the one shown in fig . 1(d ) , the qpos are present during the `` high '' state , which is opposite to most of the other cases . if qpos indeed track the presence of a vigorous corona , this would imply that although our panel ( d ) in fig .  looks similar to fig . 1(d ) , it does not represent the actual situation very well . namely , the data seem to imply that the higher count rate states actually have lower accretion rates through the inner disk than the lower luminosity states ( because excess luminosity escapes into the jet ) . it is thus possible that plasma ejections occur during the sharp dips in fig 1(d ) rather than during the longer phases ( e.g. , from to 960 sec in this figure ) . the `` m - shape '' of the outbursts in fig . ( d ) may then be understood because these would be the low states as tracked by the accretion rate , and the low states of the three other panels ( a - c ) of fig .  show similar shapes albeit with lower count rates . although we have not yet made a detailed study of this suggestion , we can probably accommodate it within our model , but only if we allow the parameters in our viscosity law to depend on the disk luminosity . note , however , that in either case we must require plasma ejections from the inner disk in order to understand panel ( d ) of fig . ( 1 ) . the discussion above of course bears on the particular choice of the viscosity law that we have made in this paper . we emphasize that our model is still rather empirical and we have not identified the actual physics of the viscosity law in grs 1915 + 105 . the real physics might well be yet more complex , and in fact , the existence of the s - curve might be due to other than radiation pressure instabilities , perhaps involving an effect that we do not currently understand . however , based on the results presented in this paper , we feel confident that there is an s - curve in this source , and that this curve can be modeled approximately by the viscosity law given by equation  . a clear shortcoming of our work is the use of a non - relativistic disk around a non - spinning black hole . we plan to improve this in our future work . we expect that this will change the `` reasonable '' values of the parameters that we used , such as the fraction , and the inner disk radius , of course , but that it will not affect the general nature of our conclusions . the authors thank t. belloni , r. taam , m. muno , e. morgan , r. remillard , e. vishniac and d. kazanas for useful discussions . this work was supported in part by nasa grants nag5 - 8239 and nag5 - 4057 , under the astrophysics theory program .", "summary": "during the past two years , the galactic black hole microquasar grs 1915 + 105 has exhibited a bewildering diversity of large amplitude , chaotic variability in x - rays . although it is generally accepted that the variability in this source results from an accretion disk instability , the exact nature of the instability remains unknown . here we investigate different accretion disk models and viscosity prescriptions in order to provide a basic explanation for the exotic temporal behavior in grs 1915 + 105 . we discuss a range of possible accretion flow geometries . based on the fact that the overall cycle times are very much longer than the rise / fall time scales in grs 1915 , we rule out the geometry of advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) or a hot quasi - spherical region plus a cold outer disk for this source . a cold disk extending down to the last inner stable orbit plus a hot corona above it , on the other hand , is allowed . we thus concentrate on geometrically thin ( though not necessarily standard ) shakura - sunyaev type disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; hereafter ss73 ) . we argue that x - ray observations clearly require a quasi - stable accretion disk solution at high accretion rates where radiation pressure begins to dominate , which excludes the standard -viscosity prescription . to remedy this deficiency , we have therefore devised a modified viscosity law that has a quasi - stable upper branch , and we have developed a code to solve the time - dependent equations to study such an accretion disk . via numerical simulations , we show that the model does account for several gross observational features of grs 1915 + 105 , including its overall cyclic behavior on time scales of 100 - 1000 s. on the other hand , the rise / fall time scales are not short enough , no rapid oscillations on time scales 10 s emerge naturally from the model , and the computed cycle - time dependence on the average luminosity is stronger than is found in grs 1915 + 105 . we then consider , and numerically test , several effects as a possible explanation for the residual disagreement between the model and the observations . a hot corona with the energy input rate being a function of the local cold disk state and a radius - dependent -parameter do not appear to be promising in this regard . however , a more elaborate model that includes the cold disk , a corona , and plasma ejections from the inner disk region allows us to reproduce several additional observed features of grs 1915 + 105 . we conclude that the most likely structure of the accretion flow in this source is that of a cold disk with a modified viscosity prescription , plus a corona that accounts for much of the x - ray emission , and unsteady plasma ejections that occur when the luminosity of the source is high . the disk is geometrically thin due to the fact that most of the accretion power is drained by the corona and the jet ."}
{"article": "galaxy clusters , the largest gravitationally - bound structures in the universe , are ideal cosmological tools . accurate measurements of their masses provide a crucial observational constraint on cosmological models . several dynamical methods have been available to estimate cluster masses , such as ( 1 ) optical measurements of the velocity dispersions of cluster galaxies , ( 2 ) measurements of the x - ray emitting gas , and ( 3 ) gravitational lensing . good agreements between these methods have been found on scales larger than cluster cores . however , joint measurements of lensing and x - rays often identify large discrepancies in the gravitational masses within the central regions of clusters by the two methods , and the lensing mass has always been found to be times higher than the x - ray determined mass . this is the so - called `` mass discrepancy problem '' ( allen 1998 ; wu 2000 ) . many plausible explanations have been suggested , e.g. , the triaxiality of galaxy clusters ( morandi et al . 2010 ) , the oversimplification of the strong lensing model for the central mass distributions of clusters ( bartelmann & steinmetz 1996 ) , the inappropriate application of the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis for the central regions of clusters ( wu 1994 ; wu & fang 1997 ) , or the magnetic fields in clusters ( loeb & mao 1994 ) . recently richard et al . ( 2010 ) present a sample of strong lensing clusters taken from the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ) , among which clusters have x - ray data from chandra observations ( sanderson et al . they show that the x - ray / lensing mass discrepancy is at significance clusters with larger substructure fractions show greater mass discrepancies , and thus greater departures from hydrostatic equilibrium . on the other hand , lensing observations of the bullet cluster 1e0657 - 56 ( clowe et al . 2006 ) , combined with earlier x - ray measurements ( markevitch et al . 2006 ) , clearly indicate that the gravitational center of the cluster has an obvious offset from its baryonic center . furthermore , recent studies ( shan et al . 2010 ) of lensing galaxy clusters reveal that offset between the lensing center and x - ray center appears to be quite common , especially for unrelaxed clusters . among the recent sample of 38 clusters of shan et al . ( 2010 ) , have been found to have offsets greater than , and clusters even have offsets greater than . motivated by such observations , we propose to investigate galaxy cluster models where the center of the dark matter ( dm ) halo does not coincide with the center of the x - ray gas ( see figure 1 ) . if the x - ray center of a cluster has an offset from its lensing ( gravitational ) center , then the x - rays and lensing are indeed measuring different regions of the cluster . given the same radius , the lensing is measuring the dm halo centered at the gravitational center ( shown by the dark blue sphere in figure 1 ) , while the x - rays are measuring the sphere of the halo that is offset from the true gravitational center ( shown by the red circle in figure 1 ) . in this case , there will always be a natural discrepancy between the lensing and x - ray measured masses or specifically , the x - ray mass will always be lower than the lensing mass , just as the long - standing `` mass discrepancy problem '' has indicated . in this paper , we investigate the lensing - x - ray mass discrepancy caused by the offsets between dm and x - ray gas . to check our predictions , we compile a sample of clusters with good lensing and x - ray measurements . we conclude that such `` offset '' effect should not be ignored in our dynamical measurements of galaxy clusters . a flat cdm cosmology is assumed throughout this paper , where =0.3 , =0.7 , and . we model our galaxy cluster with a fiducial model as the following : ( 1 ) the dm halo is modeled by the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro et al . 1997 ) with concentration and scaled radius , ( 2 ) the gas distribution is modeled by a model with , the cluster core radius , and the gas fraction , ( 3 ) the mass density of the bcg is described by a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with a velocity dispersion of . the projected mass within a sphere of radius is r ' \\ , dr ' \\ , d{\\theta},\\ ] ] where is the 2-d radius from the halo center , is the 2-d radius from the x - ray gas center , is the 2-d offset between the halo center and x - ray center , and , , and are the projected mass densities of the dm halo , the gas and the bcg , respectively . for a given radius , the gravitational mass measured by lensing can be given by ( as shown by the dark blue sphere in figure 1 ) , while the projected mass measured by x - rays is described by ( the mass within the red circle in figure 1 ) . we now calculate the mass ratio , or equivalently , . figure 2 shows the mass ratio as a function of the 2-d offset , for a typical rich cluster . the solid curves are the mass ratio with the fiducial model , the dashed and dotted curves are the mass ratio with the nfw concentration and ( top left ) , the cluster core radius and ( top right ) , the index and ( bottom left ) , the gas fraction and , respectively . for these cases , the three curves from top to bottom are for the three measuring radii , respectively . from figure 2 we have the following conclusions : \\(1 ) the lensing measured mass is always higher than the x - ray measured mass . for typical values of offset and , , comparable to the ratio found in early studies ( allen 1998 ; wu 2000 ; richard et al . 2010 ) . \\(2 ) the `` offset effect '' we are reporting here should contribute significantly to the long - standing `` mass discrepancy problem '' . \\(3 ) the ratio of increases with offset . \\(4 ) depends very strongly on . here acts like the arc radius in strong lensing , i.e. , we only measure the enclosed mass within a small region of . when is very small , the offset effect is most prominent and gives large . increasing will reduce . when is very large ( compared with ) , the offset effect will be `` smeared out '' , and the - discrepancy introduced by the offset will vanish . \\(5 ) the mass ratio is very sensitive to the nfw concentration , and it increases dramatically with . \\(6 ) the mass ratio increases with the core radius , and decreases with index and gas fraction . however , the mass ratio is not very sensitive to the gas model . and the measuring radius . the solid curves are the mass ratio for the fiducial model with , , , , and . the dashed and dotted curves are for the nfw concentration and ( top left ) , the cluster core radius and ( top right ) , the index and ( bottom left ) , the gas fraction and , respectively . the three dotted ( dashed , solid as well ) curves from top to bottom in one panel correspond to , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] to compare with our theoretical predictions , we compile a sample of clusters with arc - like images , which have both strong lensing and x - ray measurements . the clusters and their lensing and x - ray data are listed in table 1 . for the arcs that have no redshift information , we estimate their lensing masses by assuming the mean redshifts of and , respectively . the x - ray data are taken from tucker et al . ( 1998 ) , wu ( 2000 ) , bonamente et al . ( 2006 ) , and references therein . the offsets between lensing and x - ray centers are taken from shan et al . ( 2010 ) . the clusters in our table are classified as relaxed ( with cooling flow ) and unrelaxed ( which are dynamically unmature ) , from their x - ray morphologies . the definition has been used in the literature by allen ( 1998 ) , wu ( 2000 ) , baldi et al . ( 2007 ) , and dunn & fabian ( 2008 ) . mass from strong lensing . assuming a spherical matter distribution , one can calculate the gravitational mass of a galaxy cluster projected within a radius of on the cluster plane as where is the critical surface mass density , , and are the angular diameter distances to the cluster , to the background galaxy , and from the cluster to the galaxy , respectively . the above equation is actually the lensing equation for a cluster lens of spherical mass distribution with a negligible small alignment parameter for the distant galaxy within . the values of within the arc radius are listed in table 1 . allen ( 1998 ) pointed out that the use of more realistic , elliptical mass models can reduce the masses within the arc radii by up to , though a value of is more typical . however , such corrections are still not very significant compared with the large discrepancies between the lensing and x - ray determined masses . we will discuss it in more detail in the next section . mass from x - rays . assuming that the intra - cluster gas is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium , the cluster mass enclosed within a radius can be easily calculated from where is the gas temperature , the gas number density , the proton mass , and the mean molecular weight . here we assume that the gas follows the conventional model , i.e. , . in order to compare the mass measured by x - rays with the lensing result , we need to convert this ( i.e. , 3-d ) into the projected mass ( see e.g. wu 1994 ) : where the mass ratio are listed in table 1 . figure 3 shows the relation between the mass ratios and the ( scaled ) offsets for our sample of clusters ( arc images ) . it should be pointed out that the clusters in our sample have quite different sizes and masses . this can be seen from the wide range of the cluster temperatures from to . therefore , it is useful to compare the offsets of the clusters on the same scale . we realize that the m - t relation of clusters scales as ( e.g. , nevalainen et al . 2000 ; xu et al . 2001 ) , and that , where r is the size of the cluster . therefore , in figure 3 , instead of using the physical offset , we use a scaled offset which is characterized by . from figure 3 , the mass ratios exhibits large dispersions roughly ranging from to . many clusters have large error bars . it appears that relax clusters ( marked by crosses ) have smaller ratios . the fact that is consistent with our theoretical predictions , and the ratio of is also roughly consistent with our predictions as plotted in figure 2 . however , no strong correlation has been found between the offset and mass discrepancies . we notice that many clusters in the sample have very small offset values smaller than the errors in lensing and x - ray measurements which are typically a few arcseconds . so these offset values are not robustly measured themselves , and we thus remove these data points and only focus on clusters with large offsets of , as has been suggested in shan et al . this leaves a sub - sample of only arc images . the dashed line in figure 3 shows a fit to this sub - sample , which satisfies with a reasonable . we can find increasing slightly with . clusters ( arc images ) . the x - label show the scaled offset between dm and baryons . the squares denote unrelaxed clusters , and crosses the relaxed clusters . the dashed line shows a fit satisfying with for the clusters with offset larger than .,title=\"fig : \" ] as has been reported by shan et al . ( 2010 ) , it might be fairly common in galaxy clusters that the x - ray center has an obvious offset from the gravitational center . we have explored the dynamical consequences of this lensing - x - ray offset and tried to attribute such an effect to the long - standing `` mass discrepancy problem '' in galaxy clusters . our theoretical model predicts that such an offset effect will always result in a larger than , with a typical mass ratio , which is consistent with observations . to test our model , we have compiled a sample of clusters , and studied in detail their lensing and x - ray properties and obtained their lensing and x - ray masses , and . the lack of strong correlation between and the offset suggests that the problem is more complicated . as we have found in section 2 , is not only a function of , but also depends very strongly on ( or the arc radius ) . apparently , each cluster in our sample has quite different . \\(1 ) the central regions of clusters may be still undergoing dynamical relaxation , and the x - ray gas may not be in good hydrostatic equilibrium . therefore , large errors could be induced in the x - ray measurement of cluster cores , especially for unrelaxed clusters . \\(2 ) the spherical models are too simple to reflect the real mass distribution of clusters . the use of more realistic mass model could reduce the lens mass within the arc radius by up to , though values of are more typical ( bartelmann 1995 ; allen 1998 ) . \\(3 ) the presence of substructures may complicate our simple spherical lens model , and hence could be a main source of uncertainties in . the absence of the secondary arc - like images in most arc - cluster systems may indicate the limitations of the spherical mass distribution in the central regions of clusters . it should be noted that the mass ratios we obtained here are slightly higher than allen ( 1998 ) and wu ( 2000 ) because they unfortunately used a hubble constant of . the use of here will of course make the mass discrepancy problem more pronounced . it should be noted that the gas represents only a perturbation due to the small ratio of gas - to - dm in the central region , likewise the offset of the gas is only a small perturbation ( less than ) to the otherwise concentric matter density or potential . it is unlikely to create a factor of two difference in the lensing - derived enclosed masses within an arc . to illustrate the lensing effect of the offset perturbation and triaxiality , we show the critical curves in figure 4 . the solid curves indicate the critical curve of circular nfw plus model without offset , the dotted curves indicate the critical curve of elliptical nfw plus model with offset . the square and cross denote the center of dark matter and the hot gas , respectively . for the nfw profile , ; for the model , . we also introduce the triaxiality with the ellipticity and position angle . we also assume the lens and source redshifts , . we can see that the predicted critical curves ( dotted lines ) have very similar sizes as the predicted critical curves for a benchmark model ( solid lines ) with the same mass dm and gas mass but in concentric spheres . model without offset . the dotted curves indicate the critical curve of elliptical nfw & model with offset . the square and cross denote the center of dark matter and the x - ray gas , respectively . for the nfw profile , ; for the model , . the ellipticity and position angle are and . the lens and source redshifts are , .,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] early studies have suggested that statistically unrelaxed clusters have larger mass discrepancies than relaxed clusters ( allen 1998 ; wu 2000 ; richard et al . 2010 ) . as shan et al .

{"article": "we study the problem to find solutions of non - homogeneous double - confluent heun equations that are monodromy eigenfunctions . our study is motivated by applications to nonlinear equations modeling the josephson effect in superconductivity . the main results , their existence and uniqueness ( theorems and ) are stated in subsection 1.1 . applications to monodromy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of homogeneous double confluent heun equations and to nonlinear equations modeling josephson effect are presented in subsection 1.1 , sections 4 and 5 . each eigenfunction is the product of a monomial and a function holomorphic on . the heun equation is equivalent to recurrence relations on the laurent coefficients of the function . the proofs of the above - mentioned results are based on studying the latter recurrence relations . we prove existence and uniqueness theorem for converging solutions of a more general class of recurrence relations ( stated in subsection 1.2 and proved in section 2 ) . its proof is based on ideas from hyperbolic dynamics and a fixed point argument for appropriate contracting mapping . we consider the family of double confluent heun equations our goal is to study existence of its eigenfunctions with a given eigenvalue , : solutions of the form to do this , we study the non - homogeneous equations of type one of our main results is the next theorem for every , there exist holomorphic functions on a neighborhood of zero , such that the functions satisfy equations  for appropriate , . the functions are unique up to constant factor ( depending on the parameters ) , and they are entire functions : holomorphic on . for every sign index the corresponding vector is uniquely defined up to scalar factor depending on parameters . the above constant factors can be chosen so that both and depend holomorphically on and are real - valued in for real parameter values . let . the corresponding equation  has a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue , , if and only if the corresponding vectors are proportional : theorem will be proved in the next subsection and section 2 . the corollary will be proved in the next subsection . the explicit formulas for the functions and , together with an explicit form for equation  will be given in section 3 . for every and there exists a unique function ( up to constant factor ) holomorphic on a neighborhood of zero such that . the latter constant depends only on the parameters . theorem will be proved in the next subsection . theorem is closely related to the question of the existence of a solution holomorphic at 0 of equation  ( such a solution is automatically entire , i.e. , holomorphic on ) . this question was studied by v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi in . the existence of a solution from theorem and explicit expressions for and the corresponding function ( analytic in ) were given in . the existence result implies that if , then the homogeneous equation  , i.e. , has a solution holomorphic on . a conjecture stated by v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi in loc . cit . said that the converse is true : if equation has a holomorphic solution at 0 , then . this conjecture was studied in loc . cit and , where it was reduced to a series of conjectures on polynomial solutions of auxiliary heun equations and modified bessel functions of the first kind . all these conjectures were solved in . as the next corollary shows , theorem implies the conjecture of buchstaber and tertychnyi immediately , without using neither polynomial solutions , nor modified bessel functions . ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.5 ) equation  has an entire solution , if and only if , where is the function from loc . cit . , introduced in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 31 ) , p. 337 ) ; see also formula  in subsection 4.3 below . let . then the function from theorem is an entire solution of equation  : . conversely , let equation  have a solution holomorphic at 0 . if , then there exists a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of zero satisfying the equation , by theorem . this together with the uniqueness statement of theorem implies that up to constant factor , hence . the contradiction thus obtained proves the corollary . equation  is equivalent to the recurrence relations which can be written in the matrix form a function satisfies equation  for some , if and only if its taylor coefficients satisfy  , or equivalently ,  for . similarly , a function , satisfies  , if and only if its coefficients satisfy  for . * of corollary . * let be a solution of equation  having type  . then the coefficients satisfy  for all . this together with the above remark implies that the functions satisfy  . the corresponding expressions should cancel out , since is a solution of the homogeneous equation . this implies  . conversely , let be solutions of  , and let  hold . then we can normalize the latter solutions by constant factors ( not both vanishing simultaneously ) so that . then the function given by  is a solution of equation  . this proves the corollary . as it is shown below , theorem is implied by the following general theorem consider recurrence relations in unknown sequence , where sequences numerated by satisfy the following conditions : then there exists a unique series with satisfying  for and having positive converging radius . it converges on all of . theorem will be proved in the next section . in the series from theorem for every the two neighbor coefficients , do not vanish simultaneously : hence , they present a point . each pair of neighbor coefficients determines a unique sequence satisfying  . both statements follow from the fact that for every the coefficient is expressed as a linear combination of and by  , since . hence , if some two neighbor coefficients vanish , then all the coefficients vanish , and the series is zero , a contradiction . let , then for every such that for every , there exists and unique nonzero one - sided series ( up to multiplicative constant ) converging on some punctured disk centered at 0 that satisfies recurrence relations  ( or equivalently ,  ) for . similarly , for every such that there exists and unique one - sides series ( up to multiplicative constant ) that satisfies recurrence relations  for and converges outside some disk centered at 0 . both series converge on the whole punctured complex line . let in the conditions of theorem one have ( cf .  ) . then its statements hold for all , since inequalities  hold for all . otherwise , if either , or , then the statements of theorem theorem together with remark and the first statement of example imply theorem . * of theorems and . * the coefficients of recurrence relations  satisfy the conditions of theorem for  . indeed , the asymptotics  is obvious . inequalities follow from  ( respectively ,  ) . this together with theorem proves theorem , and hence , theorem . * of theorem . * let , . inequalities  hold for . therefore , there exists a unique series converging on a neighborhood of the origin , whose coefficients satisfy  for , and it converges on all of ( theorem ) . the system of relations  for is equivalent to the statement that . this proves theorem . our results are motivated by applications to the family of nonlinear equations , which arises in several models in physics , mechanics and geometry : in a model of the josephson junction in superconductivity ( our main motivation ) , see ; in planimeters , see . here is a fixed constant , and are the parameters . set the variable change transforms  to a non - autonomous ordinary differential equation on the two - torus with coordinates : the graphs of its solutions are the orbits of the vector field on . the rotation number of its flow , see , is a function of parameters . it is given by the formula where is an arbitrary solution of equation  . the phase - lock areas are the level subsets of the rotation number in the -plane with non - empty interior . they have been studied by v.m.buchstaber , o.v.karpov , s.i.tertychnyi et al , see and references therein . each phase - lock area is an infinite chain of adjacent domains separated by adjacency points . the description of their coordinates as solutions of analytic functional equations was conjecturally stated by v.m.bushstaber and s.i.tertychnyi in and proved by the authors of the present paper in . namely , the family of non - linear equations was reduced in to two families of second order linear differential equations of double confluent heun type : equation  and the equation the latter equation is obtained by writing equation  in terms of the parameter and changing sign at . in the case , when , buchstaber and tertychnyi have shown that the adjacencies correspond exactly to those parameter values , for which equation  has a non - trivial holomorphic solution at 0 ( which is automatically an entire solution : holomorphic on ) ; see the statement in ( * ? ? ? * , paragraph 2 ) and the proof in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.3 and subsection 3.2 ) . they have explicitly constructed a family of holomorphic solutions for parameters satisfying an explicit functional equation , see corollary . they have conjectured that the latter functional equation describes the adjacencies completely . they have reduced this conjecture to another one saying that if equation  has a polynomial solution , then equation  does not have an entire solution . later they have reduced their second conjecture on polynomial solutions to the third one saying that appropriate determinants formed by modified bessel functions of the first type do not vanish on the positive semiaxis . the latter conjecture together with the other ones were proved in . the above - mentioned conjecture of buchstaber and tertychnyi on functional equation describing the adjacencies follows from corollary and their correspondence to entire solutions of heun equations . v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi have constructed symmetries of double confluent heun equation  . the symmetry , which is an involution of its solution space , was constructed in . it corresponds to the symmetry of the nonlinear equation  ; the latter symmetry was found in . in they have found new nontrivial symmetries in the case , when and equation  does not have polynomial solutions . everywhere in the paper by solution ( or ) of linear recurrence relation we mean a ( one- or two - sided ) sequence of complex numbers satisfying the relation for all ( respectively , ) . ( here one may have two - sided infinite sequences . ) if in addition , the power series converges on some annulus centered at 0 ( for all the relations under consideration , this would automatically imply convergence on all of ) then the formal solution under question is called simply a solution : the adjective `` converging '' is omitted for simplicity . in section 3 we write down explicit formulas for solutions of recurrence relations  using the proof of theorem . then in section 4 we deduce explicit functional equations satisfied by monodromy eigenvalues of double confluent heun equations ( explicit versions of corollary ) . in section 5 we apply results of sections 3 and 4 to phase - lock areas in the model of josephson effect . it is known that the ratio of the monodromy eigenvalues of equation  equals and their product equals . this together with results of section 4 implies an explicit functional equation satisfied by non - integer level curves of the rotation number as a function of parameters ( theorem in subsection 5.1 ) . the union of boundaries of the phase - lock areas coincides with the set where the monodromy has multiple eigenvalue and is described by the condition that the monodromy of equation  has eigenvalue . this together with results of sections 3 , 4 implies an explicit description of the boundaries ( corollary in subsection 5.2 ) . open problems on phase - lock areas and possible approaches to some of them using the above description of boundaries are discussed in subsections 5.5 and 5.6 . the following new result will be also proved in section 5 using results of section 4 . let , , , , , , . the double confluent heun equation  corresponding to the latter , and has a polynomial solution , if and only if , and , and in addition , the point lies in the boundary of the phase - lock area number and is not an adjacency . in other terms , the points corresponding to equations  with polynomial solutions lie in boundaries of phase - lock areas and are exactly their intersection points with the lines , , except for the adjacencies . v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi have shown in that if a point corresponds to equation  with a polynomial solution , then , are integers , and . for every initial condition there exists a unique sequence satisfying recurrence relations  , by remark . but in general , the series may diverge . we have to prove that it converges for appropriately chosen unknown initial condition . to do this , we use the following trick : we run the recursion in the opposite direction , `` from infinity to zero '' . that is , take a big and a given `` final condition '' . then the inverse recursion gives all , . it appears that the initial condition we are looking for can be obtained as a limit of the initial conditions obtained by the above inverse recursion ( after rescaling ) , as ; the only condition on is that its projectivization =(a k : a {k+1})\\in\\cp^1 ] converging to . we show that a solution of recurrence relations  gives a converging taylor series on some neighborhood of zero , if and only if ] in the complement } ] the corresponding heun equation  has a monodromy eigenfunction of the type by proposition . on has , if } ] is described by equation  . let us write it down explicitly . the corresponding matrices , , , , see  and  are a point } ] , if and only if . or equivalently , some of the corresponding monodromy eigenvalues equals . the latter statement is equivalent to  , by theorem . this proves theorem . a point in the parameter space of equation  lies in the boundary of a phase - lock area , if and only if the monodromy of the corresponding heun equation  is parabolic : has multiple eigenvalue . the point under question lyes in the boundary of a phase - lock area , if and only if the flow mapping of the vector field  for the period ( restricted to the coordinate -circle ) is parabolic : has a fixed point with unit derivative . the period mapping is the restriction to the unit circle of the monodromy of the corresponding riccati equation : the projectivized monodromy . parabolicity of the projectivization of a two - dimensional linear operator is equivalent to its own parabolicity . the proposition is proved . the monodromy matrix is the product of the formal monodromy matrix and a pair of unipotent matrices : the inverse to the stokes matrices at 0 , cf . * formulas ( 2.15 ) and ( 3.2 ) ) . therefore , if the monodromy of a heun equation  is a multiplication by scalar number , then the stokes matrices are trivial , and the monodromy coincides with the formal one . hence , both monodromies are scalar and given by the above diagonal matrix with unit eigenvalue . thus , they are trivial . the proposition is proved . the condition saying that the monodromy has multiple eigenvalue is equivalent to the statement that it has eigenvalue , by proposition . this is equivalent to the statement that there exists a multivalued solution of heun equation with : a monodromy eigenfunction with the above eigenvalue . heun equations  satisfying the latter statement will be described below by using the following proposition . afterwards we deduce immediately the description of boundaries of phase - lock areas . the proposition follows from the fact that the involution sends monodromy eigenfunctions to eigenfunctions ( proposition ) . * case 1 : , : the monodromy eigenvalue equals . * then the monodromy operator of heun equation  is a jordan cell , by proposition . consider the matrices the corresponding eigenfunction has the form equation  is equivalent to recurrence equations  with : the series should converge on . the above matrices and coincide with those constructed in  , and they are well - defined for all . therefore , the coefficients , are given by formulas  up to common constant factor , by theorem : now we will use the condition of ( anti- ) invariance ( proposition ) , which takes the form or equivalently , the free ( zero power ) term of the latter equation is equivalent to the relation which is in its turn equivalent to  , by  . therefore , existence of the above solution implies  . let us prove the converse : each equation  implies the existence of a solution  of heun equation . to do this , consider the action of the transformation on the formal series  ( with not necessarily converging ) . it sends formal solutions of heun equation ( equivalently , formal solutions of  ) to formal solutions . ( the proof of symmetry of heun equation under the transformation uses only leibniz differentiation rule and remains valid for formal series . ) the space of formal solutions is two - dimensional , and it is identified with the space of its initial conditions . the transformation is its involution . its eigenvalues are equal to , and the corresponding eigenspaces are defined by initial conditions that satisfy  . therefore , both eigenspaces are one - dimensional and are exactly characterized by equations  , since both equations  are nontrivial . thus , a formal solution of recurrence relations  is -(anti)-invariant , if and only if its coefficients , satisfy  with the corresponding sign . fix the one - sided solution of recurrence relations  for . it satisfies  , by  . the sequence extends uniquely to a two - sided formal solution of  ( a priori , not necessarily presenting a converging series for ) , since the coefficients at in  do not vanish . the latter formal solution should be -(anti-)invariant , by  and the previous statement . hence , by  . the series converges on : it is bounded from above by converging series , by the latter formula . this together with the above argument proves the theorem . we are looking for a double - infinite solution of heun equation  with holomorphic on . that is , with satisfying recurrence relations  for , which take the form the above matrices and coincide with those constructed in  , and they are well - defined for all . therefore , the coefficients , are given by formulas  up to common constant factor , by theorem . in particular , the condition of ( anti- ) invariance under the involution of the solution takes the form or equivalently , the free term ( zero power term ) of the latter equation is which is equivalent to  . the rest of proof of theorem is analogous to the proof of theorem . let , , , , , . the point lies in the boundary of a phase - lock area , if and only if one of the following four incompatible statements holds : if one of the above statements holds , then lies in the boundary of a phase - lock area , by proposition and theorems , , . conversely , let lie in the boundary of a phase - lock area . the monodromy of the corresponding heun equation  is parabolic , by proposition . it is unipotent , if and only if some of the two incompatible statements 1 ) or 2 ) holds , by theorems and . otherwise , the monodromy has jordan cell type with eigenvalue . therefore , one of the statements 3 ) or 4 ) holds , by theorems and . statements 3 ) and 4 ) are incompatible : they correspond to heun equation  with monodromy having multiple eigenvalue or respectively . this proves the corollary . let . for given and the corresponding heun equation  has a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue , if and only if the corresponding point lies in the boundary of a phase - lock area with a rotation number . for the monodromy has unit determinant ( proposition ) . therefore , if it has eigenvalue , then its other eigenvalue is also . hence , the point lies in the boundary of the phase - lock area number ( proposition ) . thus , for both signs , by proposition . the latter equality holds if and only if . conversely , if a point with lies in the boundary of a phase - lock area , and satisfied the above equality , then the monodromy eigenvalues are equal to , by proposition . the proposition is proved . here we state conjectures that are motivated by numerical simulations and theoretical results of . in what follows for every we denote the next five conjectures are due to the first author ( v.m.buchstaber ) and s.i.tertychnyi . it was shown in ( * ?

? ? * theorems 1.2 , 3.17 ) ( see remark ) imply conjecture . * a possible strategy for conjecture . * if the boundary of the phase - lock area with rotation number intersects the line , then the intersection points correspond to parabolic monodromy operator of jordan cell type with both eigenvalues equal to -1 ( proposition ) . that is , some of equations  or  should hold at each intersection point . let , and let the parameter satisfy some of equations  if , or  if . then the double - valued eigenfunction from proposition gives a periodic solution of the corresponding riccati equation having rotation number between 0 and . * a possible strategy for conjecture . * we know that for the statements of conjecture and hence conjecture hold ( chaplygin theorem argument , see ( * ? ? ? * lemma 4 ) and ( * ? ? ? * proposition 3.4 ) ) . the adjacencies of a phase - lock area with rotation number can not lie on lines with , see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.17 ) ; this also follows from proposition . suppose that for a certain `` critical '' value the boundary of the phase - lock area number moves from the right to the left , as decreases to , and touches the line at some point , as . then there are two possibilities for the corresponding heun equation : - the associated heun equation  ( equation  with replaced by ) has a polynomial solution . but this case is forbidden by buchstaber tertychnyi result ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4 ) , which states that then the corresponding rotation number can not be greater than . - the point an adjacency : heun equation  has a solution holomorphic on . this together with the above - mentioned known fact that the boundaries of phase - lock areas are graphs of functions ( remark ) implies that both boundary components of the phase - lock area with rotation number are tangent to the line at the point . a possible approach to conjecture could be studying equations  and  defining the boundaries and to see what happens with them when the `` non - resonant '' parameters approach the resonant ones . a first step is done below . ] description of boundaries of phase - lock areas near adjacencies . relation to conjecture ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ let us write down equation  on the boundaries in a neighborhood of a line , . let us recall the formulas for the corresponding matrices : equation  for the boundaries is note that the matrices are analytic in a neighborhood of the line except for the matrix , which has pole of order one along the latter line . one has set one has by  and since the matrices , coincide with the matrices , preceding  with . therefore , now equation  can be rewritten as taking into account asymptotics  one gets asymptotic form of equation  : now let us consider the case , when , and let us write down equation  in a neighborhood of the line . the corresponding matrices from  are set analogously to the above calculations , we get asymptotic relation  . together with  , it implies conjecture together with the above remark would imply that for every at every adjacency in the line at least one boundary component of the corresponding phase - lock area ( depending on the above - chosen sign ) is transversal to the line . conjecture implies that no adjacency can be born from a tangency of both boundary components with a line , , by transversality ( the above statement ) . in other words , it implies conjecture , and hence , conjecture , by proposition . * open question 6 . * study the degeneracy of equation  on non - integer level curves of rotation number , as the latter number tends to an integer value . the level curves should degenerate to boundaries of phase - lock areas . how to retrieve equations  and  on the boundaries and equation on the adjacencies from asymptotics of degenerating equation  ?

{"article": "nuclear fragmentation resulting from heavy ion collsions is a complex phenomenon . the role of equilibration and dynamics has not yet been determined as a plethora of approaches have been investigated . examples of approaches are evaporative pictures , percolation models , lattice gas models , and dynamical models based on boltzmann simulations . in this paper we consider the statistical approach where one considers sampling all configurations of non - interacting clusters . recently , chase and mekjian derived relations which allow the exact calculation of the canonical partition function for such a system . by eliminating the need for computationally intensive monte carlo procedures and associated approximations , this technique allows a deeper insight into the thermodynamic principles which drive the statistics of fragmentation . in the next section we present the recursive technique of chase and mekjian and review the thermodynamic properties , some of which have already been presented in the literature . we emphasize that the surface energy is the most important parameter in determining the fragmentation and phase transition properties of the model . in the three subsequent sections , we present extensions of the model which are necessary for serious modeling of nuclear systems : excluded volume , coulomb effects , and isospin degrees of freedom . in section we show how a microcanonical distribution may be generated from the canonical distribution . for completeness , we present an outline of the model , which is based on the work of chase and mekjian . the expressions used here are based on a picture of non - interacting liquid drops . mekjian and lee had also applied similar recursion relations to a more algebraically motivated fragmentation model that was not based on a liquid - drop picture . we consider that there are nucleons which thermalize in a volume much larger than where is the ground state volume of a nucleus of nucleons . these nucleons can appear as monomers but also as composites of nucleons . the canonical partition function of this system can be written as where is the partition function of a single composite of size , is the number of such composites and the sum goes over all the partitions which satisfy . a priori this appears to be a horrendously complicated problem but can be computed recursively via the formula , here is 1 . it is this formula and the generalisation of this to more realistic case ( see later ) that makes this model so readily soluble . all properties of the system are determined by the partition functions of indepedent particles . the recursive formula above allows a great deal of freedom in the choice of partition functions for individual fragments , . any function of temperature , density and is allowed . however , explicit dependence on the configuration of the remainder of the system is outside the scope of this treatment . for the illustrative purposes of this section , we assume the form , the first part is due to the kinetic motion of the center of mass of the composite in the volume and the second part is due to the internal structure . following the choice of reference we assume the form here is the volume energy per nucleon(=16 mev ) , is the surface tension which is a function of the temperature . the origin of the different terms in eq .  is the following : is the ground state energy of the composite of nucleons , and the last term in the exponential arises because the composite can be not only in the ground state but also in excited states which are included here in the fermi - gas approximation . following reference the value of is taken to be 16 mev . lastly the temperature dependence of in ref is ^{5/4}$ ] with mev and mev . any other dependence could be used including a dependence on the average density . upon calculation , the model described above reveals a first order phase transition . in figure the specific heat at constant volume , , is displayed as a function of temperature for systems of size , , and . the sharp peak represents a discontinuity in the energy density , which sharpens for increasingly large systems . the usual picture of a liquid - gas phase transition gives a discontinuity in the energy density when pressure is kept constant rather than when the volume is kept constant . to understand this result we consider a system divided into one large cluster and many small clusters . the pressure and free energy may then be approximated as where is the number of clusters . the bulk term depends only on the temperature and not on the way in which the nucleons are partioned into fragments . we have neglected the surface energy term which is proportional to . in this limit , and become the bulk term depends only on the temperature and is therefore continuous across the phase transition . thus , a spike in is equivalent to a spike in since both are proportional to . it is difficult to make a connection between this approach and the standard maxwell construction , since here interactions between particles enter only through the surface term . intrinsic thermodynamic quantities may be calculated in a straightforward manner . for instance the pressure and chemical potentials may be calculated through the relations , calculations of and are displayed in figure as a function of density for a system of size . both the pressure and chemical potential remain roughly constant throughout the region of phase coexistence . of particular note is that the pressure actually falls in the coexistence region due to finite size effects . we now make some comments about influences of various factors in eq .  . the bulk terms , , are not affected by the free energy , thus they may be ignored when calculating fragmentation observables . their influence with respect to intrinsic thermodynamic quantities is of a trivial character . the surface term is completely responsible for determining all observables related to fragmentation and therefore all aspects of the phase transition . aside from the system size , fragmentation is determined by two dimensionless parameters . the first is the specific entropy , and the second is the surface term . at a given temperature the free energy of nucleons should be minimized . with the surface tension term , is minmised if the whole system appears as one composite of nucleons but the entropy term encourages break up into clusters . at low temperatures the surface term dominates while at high temperatures entropy prevails and the system breaks into small clusters . the mass distribution may be calculated given the partition function . the mass distribution is displayed in figure for three temperatures , 6.0 , 6.25 and 6.5 mev which are centered about the transition temperature of 6.25 mev . the distributions have been multiplied by to emphasize the decomposition of the system . the mass distribution changes dramatically in this small temperature range . the behavior is reminiscent of that seen in the percolation or lattice gas models . the volume used to define to the partition functions of individual fragments , given in eq .  , should reflect only that volume in which the fragments are free to move . hahn and stcker suggested using to incorporate the volume taken up by the nuclei . by inspecting eq .  on can see that this affects the partion function by simply mapping the density or volume used to plot observables . more realistically , the excluded volume could depend upon the multiplicity . nonetheless , in rather complicated calculations not reported here , it was found that for the purpose of obtaining diagrams in the domain of interest in this paper , it is an acceptable approximation to ignore the multiplicity dependence of the excluded volume . incorporating a multiplicity dependence would be outside the scope of the present model , as it would represent an explicit interaction between fragments . however , one could add an -dependence to the volume term to account for the difficulty of fitting fragments of various sizes into a tight volume . this might affect the model in a non - trivial fashion . we like to remind the reader that the parameter in the van der waals eos : also has its roots in the excluded volume . but there plays a crucial role . we could not for example set =0 without creating an instability at high density . furthermore , the phase transition disappears when is set to zero . it has been understood that the coulomb effects alter the phase structure of nuclear matter . although explicit coulomb interactions are outside the scope of this treatment , they may be approximated by considering a screened liquid drop formula for the coulomb energy as has been used by bondorf and donangelo . the addition to the internal free energy given in eq .  is this form implies a jellium of uniform density that cancels the nucleons positive charge when averaged over a large volume . this may be more physically motivated for the modeling of stellar interiors where the electrons play the role of the jellium . we display , both with and without coulomb terms for an system in figure . coulomb forces clearly reduce the temperature at which the transition occurs . for sufficiently large systems , coulomb destroys the transition as large drops become unstable to the coulomb force . the recursive approach employed here is easily generalized to incorporate multiple species of particles . if there exist a variety of particles with conserved charges , , one can write a recursion relation for each charge . where is the net conserved charge of type and is the charge of type carried by the fragment noted by . for the nuclear physics example , one would wish to calculate where and were the conserved neutron and proton numbers . to find one must know for all or . to accomplish this one must use both recursion relations . in nuclear collisions , one does not have access to a heat bath , but one can vary the excitation energy . a microcanonical treatment is therefore more relevant for practical calculations , particularly given the existence of a first order phase transition which occupies an infinitesimal ( in the limit of large ) range of temperatures in a canonical calculation , but a finite range of energies in a microcanonical ensemble . the relevant partition function for a microcanonical ensemble is the density of states , where the sum over represents the sum over all many - body states . although is easily calculable given the recursion relations discussed in the previous sections , one must perform the integral over numerically . the true solution for the density of states would be ill - defined given the discreet nature of quantum spectra which can not be combined with a delta function . however , if one defines the density of states in a finite region of size , the density of states becomes well - behaved even for discreet spectra . for that reason we more pragmatically define the density of states as one might have considered replacing the delta function by a lorentzian rather than by a gaussian , but this would be dangerous given that the density of states usually rises exponentially for a many - body system . the finite range used to sample the density of states might correspond to the range of excitation energies sampled in an experimental binning . in the limit , approaches the density of states . as an example of a quantity one may wish to calculate with a microcanonical approach , we consider the average multiplicity of a fragment of type in a system whose total energy is within of . where is the number of particles of species within the fragment . the integration over clearly provides an added numerical challenge that increases for small . for the purposes of generating a mass distribution , one must perform this integration for every species . it might be worthwile to consider estimating the integrals over with the saddle point method , although one should be wary of taking derivatives of with respect to in the phase transition region . microcanonical quantities might also be calculated in a completely different manner by discreetizing the energy . for instance one might measure energies in units of 0.1 mev . one might then treat energy on the same footing as any other conserved charge . one may then write recursion relations for , the number of ways to arrange nucleons with net energy , where is an integer . here , is the number of ways of arranging a fragment of type with net energy . all other relavant microcanonical quantities may be calculated in a similar manner . since one needs to calculate at all energies less than the targeted energy , and must sum over all energies less than to obtain , the length of the calculation is proportional to . typically , nuclear decays occur with on the order of a gev of energy deposited in a nucleus . therefore , these calculations may become numerically cumbersome unless the energy is discreetized rather coarsely . the recursive techniques discussed here have several attractive features . they are easy to work with , incorporate characteristics of nuclear composites and appear to have standard features of liquid - gas phase transitions . in the present forms these models are resricted to low densities . for modeling nuclear disintegration this is not a serious problem , although for completeness it would be nice to be able to modify the model so that it can be extended to higher density . in this paper we have studied thermal properties of the model , and we emphasize the importance of the surface term in determining these properties . we can associate the discontinuity in the energy density with temperature to the discontinuity in the number of clusters . in addition , we have seen that including coulomb effects lowers the temperature at which the fragmentation transition occurs and reduces the sharpness of the phase transition . we have also presented an extension of the formalism for the inclusion of isospin degrees of freedom . for comparing to nuclear physics experiments , development of the microcanonical approaches presented here is of greatest importance . it remains to be seen whether the microcanonical formalisms are tenable , as they have yet to be implemented . p. chomaz , ann . france * 21 * , 669 ( 1996 ) burgio , ph . chomaz and j. randrup , phys . 69 * , 885 ( 1992 ) . h. feldmeier and j. schnack , prog . particle nucl . phys . * 39 * , 393 ( 1997 ) . a. ohnishi and j. randrup , phys . b * 394 * , 260 d. kiderlen and p. danielewicz , nucl . a * 620 * , 346 ( 1997 ) . s. pratt , c. montoya and f. ronning , phys . b*349 * , 261 ( 1995 ) . j. randrup and s. koonin , nucl . a * 356 * , 321 ( 1981 ) . gross , rep . phys . * 53 * , 605 ( 1990 ) . bondorf , a.s . botvina , a.s . iljinov , i.n . mishustin and k. sneppen , physics reports * 257 * , 133 -

{"article": "in the standard model ( sm ) , the only source of cp violation is the kobayashi - maskawa phase , localized in the unitarity triangle ( ut ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . thanks to the precise measurements at the current -factories , cp violation could be established in , leading to a precise measurement of , where the current world average yields . the extractions of the other two angles and are expected mainly through cp violation in the charmless decays , such as and similar modes . the current -factories measurements have been averaged to yield : on the theoretical side , the analysis is challenging due to the need to know the ratio of penguin -

induced cp - asymmetry in , the u - spin counterpart of the mode . in this talk , we have proposed strategies to extract information on weak phases from cp violation observables in decays even in the presence of hadronic contributions related to penguin amplitudes . assuming knowledge of the penguin pollution , an efficient use of mixing - induced cp violation in decays , measured by , can be made by combining it with the corresponding observable from , , to obtain the unitarity triangle parameters and . the sensitivity on the hadronic quantities , which have typical values , , is very weak . in particular , there are no first -

{"article": "the natural shape of an isolated self - gravitating fluid is axially symmetric . for this reason , exact axial symmetric solutions of einstein field equations are good candidates to model astrophysical bodies in general relativity . in the last decades , several exact solutions were studied as possible galactic models . static thin disk solutions were first studied by and , where they considered disks without radial pressure . disks with radial pressure and with radial tension had been considered by and , respectively . self - similar static disks were studied by , and . moreover , solutions that involve superpositions of black holes with static disks were analyzed by and . also , relativistic counter - rotating thin disks as sources of the kerr type metrics were found by . counter - rotating models with radial pressure and dust disks without radial pressure were studied by , and , respectively ; while rotating disks with heat flow were studied by . furthermore , static thin disks as sources of known vacuum spacetimes from the chazy - curzon metric and zipoy - voorhees metric were obtained by . also , found an infinite number of new relativistic static solutions that correspond to the classical galactic disk potentials of kuzmin & toomre and mestel & kalnajs . stationary disk models including electric fields , magnetic fields , and both electric and magnetic fields had been studied . in the last years , exact solutions for thin disks made with single and composite halos of matter , charged dust and charged perfect fluid were obtained . for a survey on relativistic gravitating disks , see and . most of the models constructed above were found using the metric to calculate its energy momentum - tensor , i.e. an inverse problem . several exact disk solutions were found using the direct method that consists in computing the metric for a given energy momentum tensor representing the disk . in a first approximation , the galaxies can be thought to be thin , what usually simplifies the analysis and provides very useful information . but , in order to model real physical galaxies the thickness of the disks must be considered . exact axially symmetric relativistic thick disks in different coordinate systems were studied by . also , different thick disks were obtained from the schwarzschild metric in different coordinates systems with the displace , cut , fill , and reflect \" method . the applicability of these disks models to any structure found in nature lays in its stability . the study of the stability , analytically or numerically , is vital to the acceptance of a particular model . also , the study of different types of perturbations , when applied to these models , might give an insight on the formation of bars , rings or different stellar patterns . moreover , a perturbation can cause the collapse of a stable object with the posterior appearance of a different kind of structure . an analytical treatment of the stability of disks in newtonian theory can be found in , and references therein . in general , the stability of disks in general relativity is done in two ways . one way is to study the stability of the particle orbits along geodesics . this kind of study was made by transforming the rayleigh criterion of stability into a general relativistic formulation . using this criterion , the stability of orbits around black holes surrounded by disks , rings and multipolar fields were analyzed . also , this criterion was employed by to study the stability of the isotropic schwarzschild thin disk , and thin disks of single and composite halos . the stability of circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes was studied by and . moreover , the stability of circular orbits of the lemos - letelier solution for the superposition of a black hole and a flat ring was considered by and . also , analyzed the stability of several thin disks without radial pressure or tension studying their velocity curves and specific angular momentum . another way of studying the stability of disks is perturbing its energy momentum tensor . this way is more complete than the analysis of particle motions along geodesics , because we are taking into account the collective behavior of the particles . however , there are few studies in the literature performing this kind of perturbation . a general stability study of a relativistic fluid , with both bulk and dynamical viscosity , was done by . he considered the coefficients of the perturbed variables as constants , i.e. local perturbations . usually , this condition is too restrictive . stability analysis of thin disks from the schwarzschild metric , the chazy - curzon metric and zipoy - voorhees metric , perturbing their energy momentum tensor with a general first order perturbation , were made by , finding that the thin disks without radial pressure are not stable . moreover , stability analysis of the static isotropic schwarzschild thick disk as well as the general perturbation equations for thick disks were studied by . in newtonian gravity , models for globular clusters and spherical galaxies were developed by and . in the case of disk galaxies , important thick disk models were obtained by miyamoto and nagai from the prior work of and about thin disks galaxies . miyamoto and nagai thickened - up \" toomre s series of disk models and obtained pairs of three - dimensional potential and density functions . also , obtained a family of three - dimensional axisymmetric mass distribution from the higher order plummer models . the miyamoto - nagai potential shares many of the important properties of actual galaxies , especially the contour plots of the mass distribution which are qualitatively similar to the light distribution of disk galaxies . recently , two different extensions of the miyamoto - nagai potential appeared in the literature : a triaxial generalization which has as a particular case the original axially symmetric model , and a relativistic version which has as a newtonian limit the same original model . in order to have a general relativistic physical model for galaxies , we must consider , first of all , the thickness of the disk and its stability under perturbations of the fluid quantities . the purpose of this work is to study numerically the stability of the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk under a general first order perturbation . the perturbation is done in the temporal , radial , axial and azimuthal components of the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor of the fluid . in the general thick disk case , the number of unknowns is larger than the number of equations . this opens the possibility of performing several types of combinations of the perturbed quantities . in this manuscript we search for perturbations in which a perturbation in a given direction of the pressure creates a perturbation in the same direction of the four velocity . the energy momentum perturbation considered in this manuscript is treated as test matter \" , so it does not modified the background metric obtained from the solution of einstein equations . the article is organized as follows . in sec . , we present the general perturbed conservation equations for the thick disk case . the energy momentum tensor is considered diagonal with all its elements different from zero . also , in particular , we discuss the perturbations that will be considered in some detail in the next sections of this work . in sec . , we present the thick disk model whose stability is analyzed , i.e. the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk . the form of its energy density and pressures , as well as , the restrictions that the thermodynamic quantities must obey to satisfy the strong , weak and dominant energy conditions are shown . later , in sec . , we perform the perturbations to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk ; in particular we study its stability . finally , in sec . , we summarize our results . the thick disk considered is a particular case of the general static - axially - symmetric metric where , and are functions of the variables  . ( our conventions are : , metric signature + 2 , partial and covariant derivatives with respect to the coordinate denoted by and , respectively . ) in its rest frame , the energy momentum tensor of the fluid is diagonal with components ( - ) , where is the total energy density and  are the radial , azimuthal and axial pressures or tensions , respectively . so , in this frame of reference , the energy momentum tensor can be written as where , , , and are the four vectors of the orthonormal tetrad which satisfy the orthonormal relations . note that with the above definitions , the timelike four velocity of the fluid is and the quantities , , and are the spacelike principal directions of the fluid . furthermore , the energy momentum tensor satisfies einstein field equations , . moreover , the quantities involved in the energy momentum tensor and the coefficients of the perturbed conservation equations are functions of the coordinates  only . let us consider a general perturbation of a quantity of the form where is the unperturbed quantity and is the perturbation . replacing  for each quantity in the energy momentum tensor  and calculating the perturbed energy momentum equations , , we obtain \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta u^\\theta \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta u^z \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta \\rho ( -i w u^t u^t ) = 0,\\ ] ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta \\rho ( u^t u^t \\gamma^r {tt } ) + \\delta p r { \\rm g}(r , r , x^r x^r ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta p \\theta ( y^\\theta y^\\theta \\gamma^r {\\theta\\theta } ) + \\delta p z ( z^z z^z \\gamma^r {zz } ) = 0,\\ ] ] + \\delta p \\theta ( k \\theta y^\\theta y^\\theta ) = 0,\\ ] ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta \\rho ( u^t u^t \\gamma^z {tt } ) + \\delta p r ( x^r x^r \\gamma^z {rr } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\delta p {\\theta } ( y^\\theta y^\\theta \\gamma^z {\\theta\\theta } ) + \\delta p z { \\rm g}(z , z , z^z z^z ) = 0.\\ ] ] where and are the christoffel symbols . in finding eqs . - we assumed that the perturbed energy momentum tensor does not modify the background metric . also , we disregard terms of order greater or equal to . for details see . besides the four equations furnished by the energy momentum conservation equations , , there is another important conservation equation , the equation of continuity , where is the proper number density of particles . the proper number density of particles , and the total energy density are related through the relation , where is the constant mean baryon mass and the internal energy density . multiplying eq .  by , performing the covariant derivative  and using eq .  , we obtain that now , from the relation and the energy momentum tensor  , we obtain an expression for . substituting this last expression into eq .  we finally arrive to which is a first order differential equation for . therefore , with given by  the equation of continuity  is satisfied . for this reason , the continuity equation can be omitted in our stability analysis because , in principle , we can always find a solution for . hereafter , the contribution of and to the total energy density are taken into account in . in the case in which the internal energy density of the fluid is given , the equation of continuity must be considered . the thermodynamic properties of the system can be obtained from observations or theoretically , e.g. from the fokker - planck equation , where we obtain the particle distribution function of the disk . solving the three dimensional fokker - planck equation is not an easy task , but some progress in newtonian gravity had been done . the four equations , - , contain seven independent unknowns , say . so , at this point , the number of unknowns are greater than the number of equations . this opens the possibility to perform different kind of perturbations . in this article we are interested in perturbations in which the velocity perturbation in a certain direction leads to a pressure perturbation in the same direction . for example , if we perturbed the axial component of the velocity , , then we must perturb . with the above criterion , and without imposing any extra conditions to the individual perturbations , only four perturbations combinations are allowed and will be considered in our thick disk model . furthermore , we perform the perturbation with the extra imposed condition . in this particular case , the system of equations reduces to a second order partial differential equation . a static general relativistic version of the miyamoto - nagai disk was constructed by by making a correspondence between the general isotropic line element in cylindrical coordinates and the miyamoto - nagai model . these general relativistic disks are obtained with  and the specializations , where , is the mass of the disk , and  are constants that control the shape of the density curves . with this metric , the energy density and pressures for the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk are }{4 \\pi \\xi^3 ^5 } , \\\\ & & p r = p \\theta = {16 \\pi \\xi^3 ^5 } , \\\\ & & p z = {8 \\pi \\xi^2 ^5 } , \\ ] ] where and . without losing generality we set in eqs . - . to satisfy the strong energy condition ( gravitational attractive matter ) we must have that the `` effective newtonian density '' . the weak energy condition requires and the dominant energy condition requires , and . the parameters used in this article satisfy all energy conditions . furthermore , the level curves show that it is physically acceptable . we remark that these are not the only parameters in which the level curves are physically acceptable . in the next section we apply the selected perturbations of sec . to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk mentioned above and study its stability . before applying the different kinds of perturbations to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk we must do some considerations . note that the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk is infinite in the radial and axial directions . we want to study the stability of a finite disk . so , in order to achieve this requirement we need a cutoff in the radial coordinate . in eqs .  ,  and  , we see that the thermodynamic quantities decrease rapidly enough to define a cutoff in both coordinates . the radial cutoff and the axial cutoff are set by the following criterion : the energy density within the disk formed by the cutoff parameters has to be more than 90% of the infinite thick disk energy density . the above criterion , and the parameters used in the article , leads to a radial cutoff of units and an axial cutoff of units . the other 10% of the energy density that is distributed from outside the cutoff parameters to infinity can be treated , if necessary , as a perturbation in the outermost boundary condition . we start perturbing the four velocity in its components and . from the physical considerations mentioned in sec . we also expect variations in the thermodynamic quantities and . the set of equations - reduces to a second order ordinary differential equation for the perturbation , say where are functions of  , see appendix . for this particular case we have , . note that in eq .  the coordinate only enters as a parameter . moreover , the equation for is independent of the parameter , but needs to be different from zero to reach that form . the second order equation  is solved numerically with two boundary conditions , one at and the other at the radial cutoff . at we set the perturbation to be 10% of the unperturbed pressure  . in the outer radius of the disk we set because we want our perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk and , in that way , to be in accordance with the applied linear perturbation . we say that our perturbations are valid if their values are lower , or of the same order of magnitude , than the 10% values of its unperturbed quantities . in fig . , we present the amplitude profile of the radial pressure perturbation in the plane for different values of the parameters and . as in the newtonian case , the less the ratio , the flatter is the mass distribution . we see that the perturbation for  decreases rapidly with and has oscillatory behavior . at first sight , the perturbation appears to be stable for all , but in order to make a complete analysis we have to compare at each radius the values of the perturbations with the values of the radial pressure . for this purpose , we included in the same graph a profile of the 10% value of . we see that the perturbations of for different values of are always lower or , at least , of the same order of magnitude when compared to these 10% values . in the flatter case  , the perturbation shows the same qualitative behavior , but the amplitudes of the oscillations are slightly higher . in both cases the amplitudes are well below the 10% values of . if we consider a very flat galaxy  with we found that some modes are not stable in a small region near the center of the disk , from to , because the perturbation amplitude is bigger than the 10% value of and our general linear perturbation is no longer valid . we also performed stability analyses for the physical radial velocity perturbation and the physical azimuthal velocity perturbation . note that our four velocity  has only components in the temporal part , so we do not have values of and to make comparisons with the perturbed values and . for that reason we compared , in first approximation , the amplitude profiles of these perturbations with the value of the escape velocity in the newtonian limit . in the newtonian limit of general relativity , , we have the well known relation . so , the newtonian escape velocity can be written as , see . with this criterion , the perturbations and are stable because their values are always well below the escape velocity value . recall that the perturbation does not depend on the parameter , but the perturbations and do . we performed numerical solutions for the perturbations and with different values of the frequency , and we find that when we increase the value of the perturbations become more stable . in this subsection we set the value of the parameter . we performed the same analysis for different values of the parameter , and we found that the perturbations show the same qualitative behavior . therefore , we can say that the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk shows some not - stable modes for very flat galaxies , e.g.  . otherwise the disk is stable under perturbations of the form presented in this subsection . nevertheless , if we treat the 10% of the energy density as a perturbation in the outermost radius of the disk by setting , where of , the qualitative behavior of the mode profiles is the same . in the case of flat galaxies , when they present not stable modes , more complex structures like rings , bars or halos can be formed . moreover , if we set the frequency we obtain the same equation for the perturbation , say  . in this case , the real part of the general perturbation diverges with time and the perturbation is not stable . these last considerations can be applied to every perturbation in the following subsections . in this subsection we perturb the four velocity in its components and , and we expect variations in the thermodynamic quantities and . the set of equations - reduces to a second order ordinary differential equation for the perturbation given by where are functions of  , see appendix . note that in eq .  the coordinate only enters as a parameter . like the previous case , eq .  is independent of the parameter , but in order to reach that form we must have different from zero . the second order equation  is solved numerically with two boundary conditions , one in and the other in . at we set the perturbation to be of the unperturbed pressure  . in the outer plane of the disk we set because we want our perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk , and in that way , to be in accordance with the linear perturbation applied . in fig , we present the amplitude profiles of the axial pressure perturbation , the physical axial velocity perturbation and the physical azimuthal velocity perturbation for and different values of the parameters and . for comparison reasons , we included in the graphs the amplitude profile that corresponds to 10% of the value of and the escape velocity profile . note that for  some modes of the axial pressure perturbation are above the 10% profile of , e.g. the modes with and . in these cases we can say that the mode with is not stable and that the mode with is near the validity criterion used for the perturbations . these modes are also present in the flatter galaxy  and have the same behaviors . the mode is actually not stable . this can be seen in the azimuthal velocity perturbation profiles , where its amplitude is greater than the escape velocity . note that in the velocity perturbation graphs the mode is also not stable . the azimuthal pressure perturbation , not depicted in fig , has all the modes well below the 10% profile of , and therefore is stable . the perturbations and do not depend on the parameter , but the perturbations and do . we performed numerical solutions for the perturbations and with different values of the frequency , and we find that when we increase the value of the perturbations become more stable . we have performed the same above analysis for different values of the parameter , and we found that the qualitative behavior is the same . we see from fig . that the not stable modes are more pronounced for the flatter galaxy . furthermore , for very flat galaxies some modes like become not stable . in general , for not stable modes , more complex structures like rings , bars or spiral arms may be formed . in this subsection we perturb the radial component of the four velocity , the radial pressure and the energy density of the fluid . the set of equations - reduces to a second order ordinary differential equation for the perturbation of the form  . the forms of the functions are given in appendix . in this case , the coordinate only enters as a parameter . due to the fact that we are not considering perturbations in the azimuthal axis , the coefficients of the second order ordinary differential equation do not depend on the wavenumber . this second order equation is solved numerically with the same boundary conditions described in sec . . in fig . we present the amplitude profiles for different perturbation modes of the radial pressure in the plane for different values of the parameters and . we see in the graph that the perturbation profiles decrease rapidly in few units of . also , the values of the radial velocity perturbation and energy density perturbation , not depicted , are well below the escape velocity and the 10% energy profile , respectively . we performed the above analysis for different values of and we found that the quantities involved have the same qualitative behavior . from these results , we can say that the general linear perturbation applied is highly stable and , for that reason , the perturbations do not form more complex structures . in this subsection we perturb the axial component of the four velocity , the axial component of the pressure and the energy density of the fluid . the set of equations - reduces to a second order ordinary differential equation for the perturbation of the form  . the functions are given in appendix . note that , like in sec . , the coordinate only enters as a parameter . in this case , we are not considering azimuthal perturbations and therefore the quantities involved do not depend on the parameter . the second order equation is solved following the procedure of sec . . in fig . we present the amplitude profiles of the axial pressure perturbation and the physical axial velocity perturbation , for and for different values of the parameters and . we see that the axial pressure perturbation modes for  are always of the some order of magnitude or lower when compared to the 10% profile . in the flatter case  , note that the amplitude of the mode is greater in some region of the domain . this fact is reflected in the axial velocity perturbation profile where the mode have a strange behavior . all of the modes , including the mode with , are stable because they are well below the escape velocity , which is not depicted . the modes that correspond to the energy density perturbation are all stable . for highly flat galaxies the mode is not stable and may form more complex structures . for higher values of the parameter the modes are more stable . we performed the above analysis for different values of the parameter and we found that the quantities involved have the same qualitative behavior . in this subsection we perturb the radial component of the four velocity , the axial component of the four velocity , the radial pressure and the axial pressure . as we said in sec . , we need an extra condition to set the number of unknowns equal to the number of equations . in this case , we set . therefore , the set of equations - reduces to a second order partial differential equation for the pressure perturbation , say where  are functions of  , see appendix . the partial differential equation  is solved numerically with four boundary conditions , at , , and . they are different ways in which we can set the boundary conditions in order to simulate various kinds of pressure perturbations . here , we treat only the case when we have a pressure perturbation at and along the axis , i.e. some kind of a rod perturbation . we set the value of the rod pressure perturbation to be 10% of the axial pressure . we set the values of the other boundary conditions equal to zero because we want the perturbation to vanish when approaching the edge of the disk . we choose the 10% of the value of the axial pressure instead of the radial pressure because it has the lowest value near . in that way , the perturbation values are also below the 10% values of the radial pressure and the general linear perturbation is valid . in fig . , we present the perturbation amplitudes for the pressure , the physical radial velocity and the physical axial velocity , for and for different values of the parameters and . we see in the pressure perturbation graph that the perturbation rapidly decays to values near zero when we move out from the center of the disk . this behavior is the same for every galaxy considered . in the velocity perturbations profiles we can see a phenomenon that is more clear in the flatter galaxy . note that in the lower domain of the disk the axial velocity perturbation is negative . this means that due to the linear perturbation the disk tries to collapse to the plane . now , if we look to the radial velocity perturbation graph , we note that the upper and lower parts depart from the center of the disk due to the positive radial perturbation . so , with these considerations , we may say that the disk tends to form some kind of ring around the center of the disk . this phenomenon is greater for highly flat galaxies and lower for more spherical systems . in this article we studied the stability of the recently proposed general relativistic miyamoto - nagai model by applying a general first order perturbation . we can say that the stability analysis performed is more complete than the stability analysis of particle motion along geodesics because we have taken into account the collective behavior of the particles . however , this analysis can be said to be incomplete because the energy momentum perturbation tensor of the fluid is treated as a test fluid and does not alter the background metric . this is a second degree of approximation to the stability problem in which the emission of gravitational radiation is considered . the different stability analyses made to the general relativistic miyamoto - nagai disk show that this disk is stable for higher values of the wave number and the frequency . for lower values of and the disk presents not - stable modes that may form more complex structures like rings , bars or halos , but in order to study them we need a higher order perturbation formalism . in general , not - stable modes appear more for flatter galaxies and less for spherical systems . m.u . and p.s.l . thanks fapesp for financial support ; p.s.l . also thanks cnpq . the general form of the functions  appearing in the second order ordinary differential equation  is given by where , and are in eqs .  and  , we denote the coefficients of eq .  by , the coefficient of eq .  by , the coefficient of eq .  by , the coefficient of eq .  by , e.g. , the first term in  has the coefficient multiplied by the factor , the second term has the coefficient multiplied by the factor , etc . the explicit form of the above equations is obtained replacing the fluid variables  of the isotropic schwarzschild thick disk . the general form of the functions  appearing in the second order ordinary differential equation  is given by where , and are and the meaning of the coefficients  is explained in appendix . the general form of the functions  is given by where , and are and the meaning of the coefficients  is explained in appendix . the general form of the functions  is given by where , and are and the meaning of the coefficients  is explained in appendix . the general form of the functions  appearing in the partial second order differential equation  is given by semerk o. , 2002 , gravitation : following the prague inspiration , to celebrate the 60th birthday of jiri bik , edited by semerk o. , podolsky j. , zofka m. , world scientific , singapure , 111 , available at http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0204025 .", "summary": "the stability of a recently proposed general relativistic model of galaxies is studied in some detail . this model is a general relativistic version of the well known miyamoto -

annotate them . specifically , the objective is to achieve an operating point with high precision , to enable robust contextual inference . there has been very little previous work towards this end . axoplasmic reticula are present only in axons , indicating the identity of the surrounding process and informing automatic segmentation . the brain data we are working with was color corrected using gradient - domain image - stitching techniques to adjust contrast through the slices . we use this data as the testbed for running our filters and annotating axoplasmic reticula . the bilateral filter is a non - linear filter consisting of one 2d gaussian kernel , which decays with spatial distance , and one 1d gaussian kernel , which decays with pixel intensity : p = {w p}\\sum {q\\in s}g {\\sigma {s}}(||p -

location ( with some tolerance ) in either of the adjacent slices . if a previously annotated axoplasmic reticulum object is present , we confirm the existing annotation . otherwise , the adjacent slice locations are checked for axoplasmic reticula with a less restrictive growing algorithm , and new annotations are added in the corresponding slice . if no axoplasmic reticulum object is found in either of the adjacent slices , then we assume the annotation in the current slice to be incorrect , and delete it . we qualitatively evaluated our algorithm on 20 slices from the kasthuri11 dataset , and quantitatively compared our results against ground truth from a neurobiologist . our algorithm annotates axoplasmic reticulum objects with 87% precision , and 52% recall . these numbers are approximate since there is inherent ambiguity even among expert annotators . our current algorithm is designed to detect transverally sliced axoplasmic reticula . in future work , we plan to extend our morphological region growing algorithm to also find dilated axoplasmic reticula , and to incorporate a more robust tracking method such as kalman or particle filtering . additionally , our algorithm can be adapted to annotate other features in neural em data , such as mitochondria , by modifying the morphological region growing algorithm .", "summary": "* abstract : * in this paper , we present a new pipeline which automatically identifies and annotates axoplasmic reticula , which are small subcellular structures present only in axons . we run our algorithm on the kasthuri11 dataset , which was color corrected using gradient -

{"article": "the cdf collaboration has reported an excess in the production of two jets in association with a boson production from data collected at the tevatron with a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev and an integrated luminosity of 4.3 fb . the boson is identified through a charged lepton ( electron or muon ) with large transverse momentum . the invariant mass of the dijet system is found to be in the range of 120 - 160 gev . the dijet production has a few pb cross - section which is much larger than standard model ( sm ) expectation . the dijet system may be interpreted as an unidentified resonance with mass around 150 gev which predominantly decays into two hadron jets . this leads to the speculation that a beyond sm new particle has been found . at present the deviation from the sm expectation is only at 3.2 level . the excess needs to be further confirmed . on the theoretical side , our understanding of the parton distributions and related matter still have room for improvement to make sure that the excess represents genuine new physics beyond the sm . nevertheless studies of new particle explanation has attracted much attention . several hypothetic particles beyond sm have been proposed to explain the cdf dijet excess , such as leptophobic model , technicolor , colored vector , scalar , quasi - inert higgs bosons and the other possibilities . common to all of these models is that the new particle must decay predominantly into hadrons ( dijet ) . we note that a class of particles which can naturally have this property . these are those scalars which are colored and couple to quarks directly . in order for these scalars to be considered as a possible candidate , it must satisfy constraints obtained from existing experimental data . colored particles which couple to two quarks have been searched for at the tevatron and the lhc . if the couplings to quarks / gluon are the same as the qcd coupling , the color triplet diquark with a mass in the range gev is excluded at the tevatron , and the mass intervals , gev , tev and tev are excluded at the lhc whereas the lhc data is limited for gev . the color sextet diquarks with electric charge , , , , are excluded for their masses less than 1.8 , 1.9 , 2.7 tev , respectively . the color octet vectors / scalars which interact with quarks / gluon by qcd coupling are excluded for tev . if their couplings to quarks / gluon are smaller than the qcd coupling the constraints are weaker . some aspects of colored scalars relevant to the cdf dijet data have been considered recently . in this work we carry out a systematic study to investigate the possibility of colored scalar bosons as the new particle explaining the cdf excess through production followed by decays into two hadron jets . at the tree level , there are several new scalar bosons which can have renormalizable couplings to two quarks ( or a quark and an anti - quark ) . a complete list of beyond sm scalars which can couple to sm fermions at the tree level and some of the phenomenology have been studied before . the required production cross section and the mass from dijets excess put constraints on model parameters . some possible scenarios are ruled out when confronted with other existing data , such as data from flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes . we find that without forcing of the yukawa couplings to be some special forms most of the scalars , except the , are in trouble with fcnc data . we , however , do find that some other cases can be made consistent with all data by tuning their couplings providing a possible explanation for the dijet excess from cdf . justification of such choices may have a realization in a flavor model , which is beyond the scope of the present work of phenomenology . these colored scalars also have interesting signatures at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) which can be used to further distinguish different models . the paper is organized as follows . in section , we study possible colored - scalars which can couple to two quark ( or a quark and a anti - quark ) , and determine their yukawa couplings by requiring that the colored scalar with a mass of 150 gev to explain the cdf dijet excess data . in section , we study the constraints from fcnc data on colored scalar couplings . in section , we give some implications for the rhic and the lhc . finally , we summarize our results in sec . . scalar bosons which have color and have renormalizable yukawa couplings to two quarks or a pair of a quark and an anti - quark can be easily determined by studying bi - products of two quarks . the quarks transform under the sm as : the following bi - products , and . here and are generation indices . with these quantum numbers , we can have the following quark bi - products where the superscript `` '' indicates charge conjugation . for those scalars which only couple to right - handed quarks , the contribution to associated production will be small because they do not directly couple to boson . to have large associated production for the cdf excess , we therefore consider the following colored scalars which can couple to left - handed quarks where is a color index , is the generator normalized as , and  is a generator of the symmetric tensor ( , ) . the color component fields , , and , are defined by having the kinetic energy term normalized properly . we denote the component fields of as follows : where are the indices . for neutral , the physics component can be separated according to their parity property with and . for production by collision , the leading contributions are from the -channel and -channel tree diagrams as shown in fig . . -channel and -channel process in production . solid , wavy and dashed line represents quark or anti - quark , and , respectively . ] for , and the -channel production can exist in addition to the diagram of -channel quark exchange . one needs to know how the colored scalars couple to quarks and the boson . we list the yukawa couplings in the quark mass eigenstate basis in the following , where . the flavor space is described as , and , where is a ckm quark mixing matrix , and ( , ( 6,3 ) , ( 6,1 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 3,1 ) ) are the coupling matrix in flavor space . and are symmetric , and , and are anti - symmetric , under the exchange of flavor indices and . the diquark couplings are where is triplet , and is singlet . the electroweak gauge interactions are given by where is the covariant derivative . the electroweak gauge interactions of the colored scalars are obtained from the following : where is the sine of the weinberg angle , and . in the above color indices are suppressed and interaction with gluons are omitted . for color - octet and , diquarks , the dominant contributions to the production are from couplings to the first generation , . for , diquarks , on the other hand , because the yukawa coupling matrix is anti - symmetric in generation space , the dominant contribution would come from term ( which includes and quark coupling suppressed by cabibbo mixing ) . in general different component in can have different masses . in order to avoid the contribution to parameter , we assume that all the components have the same masses for simplicity . since interactions and the masses of the colored scalars are fixed , the only unknowns parameters , the yukawa couplings , can be determined by requiring the colored scalars to explain the cdf dijet data . we consider the different type of colored scalars separately . for the fit , we use madgraph / madevent and pythia for the particle - level event - generation , and pgs for the fast detector simulation . jets are defined in cone algorithm with . we apply the same kinematical cuts as those denoted in ref . the reconstructed jet momenta are rescaled so that the dijet invariant - mass has correct peak at the resonance masses . the simulation result for the case of color - octet scalars with coupling is shown in fig . inclusive production cross - section at the tevatron is estimated to be 2 pb ( without multiplying -factor ) . for other cases , we obtained similar distribution . dijets events at the tevatron . cdf data taken from ref . is shown with our mc simulation results for the color - octet scalar model with ( solid ) and the standard - model contribution ( dashed ) . ] we list the central values of yukawa couplings for each case in the following , we see that the yukawa couplings are of order for color - octet scalars , but close to for diquark scalars . the sizeable yukawa couplings for the diquark scalars come from the fact that the tevatron is a collider therefore the production of diquark must pick up one sea - quark whose distribution function is suppressed . the large values for and couplings are required since the production cross - section is suppressed due to the cabibbo mixing suppressed couplings to and quarks and the suppressed or -quark parton distribution inside a proton . the difference between them is mainly due to being a triplet or a singlet under . two comments are in order about the sizeable colored scalar yukawa couplings which may cause problems in decay widths and constraints from direct resonant search for these scalers , at experiments such as at the ua2 . first , the decay widths of these scalars are less than 1 gev for color - octet cases , and a few to several gev for diquark scalars , where the flavour structure of the yukawa couplings of the scalars to quarks is assumed to those determined in the next section . these decay widths are small enough to regard the width of the observed dijet resonance as the consequence of the resolution of the jet momentum measurements . second , inclusive production of the scalars which couple to quarks are constrained by the two - jet invariant mass spectrum measurement in the ua2 experiment . for gev , the cross - section times the branching ratio to two jets is excluded for pb . the couplings in eq.(8 ) provide values for in pb as .\\ ] ] from the above values we see that the couplings in eq.(8 ) can not be excluded by the ua2 measurement . the cross section for is on the border of the constraint . we can estimate the dijet production cross - section at the tevatron . for the couplings in eq .  , the + production cross - sections are estimated to be .\\ ] ] the largest is about 0.7 pb , which is 23% of within the sm estimation in leading - order . this fraction is similar to . therefore , although there have been no statistically significant signal on the diboson production in mode at the tevatron yet , production should be more carefully studied . from the previous section we see that the yukawa couplings of these colored scalars to the first and second generations are much larger than that of the usual higgs in order to explain the cdf dijets excess . therefore we need to check whether such large yukawa couplings are consistent with data . we now study constraints from new fcnc interactions by colored scalars which may induce sizeable meson - antimeson mixing . we consider each case separately in the following . some phenomenological studies of the octet - doublet scalar can be found in . here we study the constraints from the mixing of mesons for large yukawa coupling to the first generation of quarks . for couples with and , we have if is not diagonal , exchange of will induce large fcnc effects at tree level , such as - mixing , making the model inconsistent . even if is diagonal , exchange of at loop level can also induce fcnc interaction which may result in too large - and - mixings . to minimize possible fcnc interaction , we will work with a special case where ( where is a unit matrix ) for illustration  . - mixing induced by coupling . dashed line represents the octet - doublet scalar propagation . ] in the case where only coupling is turned on  , the - mixing operator is induced by - and - box diagrams shown in fig . . in order to show the contribution , we define the following quantities : where , ( is the mass of boson ) , and . the loop functions and are given by we obtain the contribution of - mixing amplitude as where is a kaon decay constant , is a kaon mass , and is a bag parameter from the matrix element of the operator between mesons . here the and terms are from the - box diagram while the term is from the - box diagram . the kaon mass difference is obtained by . inserting the value given in eq .  ( under the current assumption , ) , we find that the term gives dominant contribution , which corresponds to the - box diagram with charm quark mass insertions . the short distance sm contribution has uncertainty which mainly comes from the charm mass and qcd correction . for the - system , the short distance sm contribution with the next - to - leading order qcd correction can fill roughly 80% of the experimental result , gev . though the long distance contribution is hard to be estimated , the total mixing amplitude in sm can be consistent with the experiment . we exhibit the ratio of the leading order contribution and the short distance sm contribution , which is free from the hadronic uncertainty , here we see that the contributions from the octet scalar is at 12% of the short distance sm contribution of the mixing amplitude for the value suggested by the dijet excess , and therefore , consistent with the experimental result of kaon mass difference . the imaginary part of the mixing amplitude gives indirect cp violation in - mixing . we find that is less than 2% , and thus it is consistent with experiments . the mixing amplitudes of - are obtained just by replacing , , and properly , and they are found to be at the level of less than 1% of the standard model prediction as well as the experimental result . when couples to and , we have in this case , to avoid large tree level fcnc , one is forced to have to be diagonal . also similar to the previous case to avoid potential large one loop fcnc , we make our illustration , of the form  with . in this case , the contribution is where and operators are the bag parameters from the matrix elements of the operators , and between mesons , respectively . the contribution is small ( % of the experimental value ) for the value for the yukawa coupling chosen from dijet excess . the situation is the same for the - mixing amplitude . the - mixing amplitude is obtained by exchanging , and replacing and in the expressions of - mixing . the mixing amplitude of - induced by the coupling is found to be very small at the level of less than compared to the short distance sm contribution . on the other hand , - mixing amplitude induced by the coupling receives a large - box contribution ( corresponding to the term ) , which is comparable to the short distance sm one . however , the short distance sm contribution of - mixing is tiny compared to the experimental result , it is expected that long distance contribution in the sm can produce the experimental value . for our purpose , it is therefore safe to say that coupling required by the cdf dijet data can satisfy constraints from - mixing data note that the octet - doublet scalar with the form can decay into , giving 20% of -jet pair fraction in events . one can also try to keep both and simultaneously non - zero . but there is a large contribution to  amplitude proportional to  . this combination must be small resulting in one of the to be much smaller than the other . this virtually goes back to the previous two cases studied . one may be able to forbid one of the couplings by some discrete symmetry , such as and and to eliminate . but to have proportional to unit chosen earlier , this raises a question how natural the choice is . while this may be achievable by some flavor symmetry to enforce the special texture form , such endeavor is beyond scope of this work and we will confine ourselves to phenomenological study only . we conclude that the cases with couples to either only or only is a phenomenologically viable model . now let us study if the color sextet or triplet diquarks are allowed . some phenomenological studies of the color sextet and triplet scalars can be found in . the sextet diquark with yukawa couplings required to explain cdf dijet excess will lead to too large mixing in - and - in contradiction with data . from eq .  one can see that exchange of at tree level can generate a mixing amplitude for - if . the constraint is estimated as . tree level mixing for is also generated by exchange . these mixing contributions can be eliminated by letting by choosing , where is a cabibbo mixing angle . however , under the exact cancellation of the tree level contributions , the loop level contributions are too large . one then has to arrange cancellation between the tree and one loop contributions . this may represents a problem of fine tuning . although this appears quite unnatural and harder to realize for building a model compared to the octet case , from purely phenomenological point of view it is not ruled out yet . the other diquarks do not induce the tree - level meson - antimeson mixing , but can be generated at the 1-loop level through the box diagram . because the diquark is an singlet and is anti - symmetric . the cdf dijet excess requires a large value of . for illustration , let us consider a simple case with and in the basis : the contribution to - mixing amplitude from is for and gev as required by the cdf dijet data , it gives twice that of the short distance sm contribution constructively , due to the enhancement factor . the coupling can also cause an excess of strangeless charm decay , such as . the interaction generates a strangeless charm decay operator , ,\\ ] ] where we use the contribution interfere with the standard model amplitude at 40% ( including the color suppressed process ) for and gev , which contradict with the experimental result of the branching ratio : br( . we conclude that is problematic to explain the cdf dijets excess , though the quantities can be adjusted by choosing the possible couplings to right - handed quarks . in the case of , a similar analysis as in the previous section can be done by supposing and in the basis . in this case , - box diagram for the - mixing vanishes due to the color anti - symetricity , and only - box diagram contributes . as a result we have : for and gev which is chosen from the dijet excess , the box contribution is the same size of the short distance sm contribution . the coupling can also contribute to the strangeless charm decay width about 20% . while those quantities may be allowed within hadronic uncertainty , they nevertheless push this scenario to the allowed boundary . in the case of diquark , the diquark coupling is a symmetric matrix , the - box contribution also vanishes due to the color anti - symmetricity . the contribution to - mixing amplitude is where if we take , and gev , the contribution is twice as much as the short distance sm contribution . however , is a symmetric matrix , and thus , one can choose and to be zero to eliminate the flavor changing process . ( under the choice , . ) therefore , the mixing amplitudes can be consistent with experiments . there is no contribution to strangeless charm decay in this choice . we note that the color triplet bosons , and , can also have a leptoquark coupling in general , and it causes a severe problem of inducing too rapid nucleon decays . one can avoid the rapid proton decays by introducing a symmetry , allowing a milder baryon number violating process , such as neutron - antineutron oscillations which can be tested at near future experiments . we summarize the results in table for the yukawa couplings of the colored scalars and fcnc constraints . we conclude that there are scenarios which are consistent with fcnc data . other ways of distinguishing these scenarios should be studied . in the next section , we will study possible signatures at the rich and lhc . .list of eligibility from the fcnc constraints of the couplings to explain the cdf +dijets . the triplet diquark can couple with right - handed quarks by yukawa - type interaction , the coupling is generally independent from the couplings to the left - handed quarks . although the production cross - section is unchanged by the right - handed quark coupling , the single production cross - section can be increased . in fig . , we also show how the cross - section would change by introducing the coupling to right - handed quarks for case . assuming the same size coupling to the first generation quarks , scatterings give the same size cross - section as the scatterings , as easily expected . couplings to right - handed quarks are also possible for case , but forbidden in color - octet , and cases . note that production cross - section has no dependence on the couplings to the right - handed quarks , but production cross - section has small dependence on the couplings to the right - handed quarks , because couplings are smaller than the couplings . at the rhic , using the polarization of the proton beam , it is possible to test the chiral structure of the diquark couplings to quarks . the partonic spin asymmetry , defined as where the subscripts describe the parton s helicity ( chirality ) , is found to be for the case we consider . thus , it can probe the ratio of the left - handed coupling which is fixed by the cdf dijet excess , and the right - handed coupling which is unknown yet . using the knowledge of the polarized parton distribution functions of quarks in valence distribution regions , it is possible to extract the partonic spin asymmetry from the hadronic observables . however , the detailed study is beyond the scope of this paper . and gev . pb of the integrated luminosity is assumed . background event ( dashed ) is estimated by the 2 qcd processes without -factor correction . signal events in case are estimated without couplings to right - handed quarks ( solid ) , and with couplings to right - handed quarks with ( dotted ) . ] at the lhc , + or + process followed by decay can be the signal again . the production cross - sections at the lhc with tev are also listed in table . the expected major backgrounds are similar to those at the tevatron ; jets , and single - top production . detailed studies for the signal - to - background analysis at the lhc can be found in refs . , for example . the + or + processes have large cross - sections as can be seen from table , especially for the diquark - type models . following the study in ref . , by taking into account the qcd jets background , the signal in the case can be seen with the signal - to - background ratio of for the events with . assuming the total detection efficiency to be , an expected integrated luminosity for the discovery is in this case . for the color - octet scalar cases , the signal - to - background ratio is estimated to be , therefore a better understanding of the background events is needed to find the signal . we have studied the possibility of explaining the cdf dijet excess by introducing colored scalar bosons . being colored scalars , through coupling to two quarks , they naturally decay into dijet which provides one of the key feature of the dijet excess . there are several colored scalars , , , , which can have tree level renormalizable yukawa couplings with two quarks . not all of them can successfully explain the dijet excess . because the dijet excess requires a sizable coupling to the first generation of quarks compared to the higgs couplings to them , the sizable couplings must also be consistent with other existing experimental data . we have analyzed fcnc constraints from meson - antimeson data . we find that without forcing of the yukawa couplings to be some special texture forms most of the scalars , except the , are in trouble with fcnc data . we , however , find that the , and can be made consistent with all data . while we confined our study to phenomenological implications of these colored particle , we note that a concrete realization of their coupling is harder to achieve . even one finds a flavor symmetry to forbid certain entries of the yukawa matrices , for example the off diagonal entries of for the octet , it is often the case that they are induced at loop level . in this sense , all the scenarios discussed here are to be considered as fine tuned until a concrete realization is achieved . the candidate of the color triplet scalar is an singlet , and it also produces dijet excess at about 1/4 of the process , which is not observed as a bump around 150 gev yet . we also studied some predictions for the diquark signal at colliders , the rhic and the lhc . if the cdf excess is the diquark origin , it may be confirmed at the early lhc study . the rhic experiment can help to distinguish the diquarks . after finishing this work , the cdf reported an updated analysis using data collected through to november 2010 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.3 fb . their results are consistent with their early analysis and increased the significance to 4.1 . recently d0 collaboration also reported their results of an analysis with an integrated luminosity of 4.3 fb . they did not find similar diget excess . although d0 was also looking at similar excess , the methodology differs in some way which may be potentially important cause for differences . we are not in a position to decide which one may be correct which has to be settled among the experimental groups . we think that a study of implications of the cdf results is still worthy . our results are not altered by the new cdf data . p. chiappetta , j. layssac , f. m. renard and c. verzegnassi , phys . d * 54 * , 789 ( 1996 ) ;

{"article": "x - ray studies of fairly normal \" galaxies , with high - energy emission not obviously dominated by a luminous active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , have recently been extended to cosmologically interesting distances in the deep field ( cdf ) surveys , which have now reached 1 ms of exposure ( cdf - n : hornschemeier et al . 2001 , hereafter paper ii ; brandt et al . 2001b , hereafter paper v ; cdf - s : tozzi et al . 2001 ; p. rosati et al . , in prep . ) . galaxies with are detected in appreciable numbers at 0.52 kev fluxes below erg s ( e.g. , paper ii ) ; the cdf - n survey goes almost two orders of magnitude fainter , detecting significant numbers of normal galaxies among the population of x - ray sources making the diffuse x - ray background ( xrb ; paper ii ; a.j . barger et al . , in prep . ) . these normal galaxies contribute as much as 510% of the xrb flux in the 0.52 kev band . the bulk of the energy density of the xrb is certainly explained by agn , but the investigation of the typical \" galaxy , whether its x - ray emission is dominated by a population of x - ray binaries , hot interstellar gas , or even a low - luminosity agn , is an equally important function of deep x - ray surveys . normal galaxies are likely to be the most numerous extragalactic x - ray sources in the universe and are expected to dominate the number counts at 0.52 kev fluxes of erg s ( ptak et al . 2001 ) . the cdf - n has reached the depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies to , corresponding to a look - back time of gyr ( km s mpc , , and are adopted throughout this paper ) . reaching larger look - back times presents the exciting possibility of detecting the bulk x - ray response to the heightened star - formation rate at ( e.g. , madau et al . 1996 ) . one thus expects the x - ray luminosity per unit -band luminosity to be larger at in the past due to the increased energy output of x - ray binary populations at ; this x - ray emission represents a fossil record \" of past epochs of star formation ( e.g. , ghosh & white 2001 ; ptak et al . therefore , measurements of the x - ray luminosities of typical galaxies can constrain models of x - ray binary production in galaxies . while x - ray emission from individual galaxies is not easily detected at , it is possible to estimate the emission at their extremely faint flux levels using statistical methods such as stacking , a technique implemented successfully on the cdf - n survey data in several previous studies . these include the detection of x - ray emission from the average bright  galaxy in the hubble deep field - north  described in brandt et al . ( 2001a , hereafter paper iv ) and a study of x - ray emission from lyman break galaxies identified in the ( brandt et al . 2001c , hereafter paper vii ) . encouraged by the success of these analyses , we extend here the study of normal galaxies to the entire plus flanking fields region , now concentrating on galaxies at to complement the study of galaxies performed in paper vii . we focus on this redshift range due to the extensive spectroscopic redshift coverage ( cohen et al . 2000 and references therein ) and superb imaging which has allowed a comprehensive galaxy morphology study ( van den bergh , cohen , & crabbe 2001 ) . the cdf - n data provide extremely deep x - ray coverage over this area ( see figure 7 of paper v for the exposure map of this region ) ; the point - source detection limits in this region of the cdf - n survey in the 0.52 kev and 28 kev bands are erg s and erg s , respectively . in this study , we place observational constraints on the evolution of the ratio of x - ray luminosity to -band luminosity of normal \" spiral galaxies up to ; this ratio is an indicator of the current level of star formation in a galaxy ( e.g. , david , jones , & forman 1992 ; shapley et al . we also place constraints on the fraction of the diffuse xrb explained by galaxies lingering just below the cdf - n detection threshold , and thus the contribution to the xrb by normal galaxies . spectroscopic redshifts for the galaxies are drawn from the catalogs of cohen et al . ( 2000 ) , cohen ( 2001 ) , and dawson et al . ( 2001 ) in the range . spectroscopic redshift determination is difficult in the range due to the absence of strong features in the observed - frame optical band and the lack of the lyman break feature useful to identify higher redshift objects . we have therefore used the deep photometric redshift catalog of fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil ( 1999 ) for the redshift interval , which allows some overlap in redshift space with the spectroscopic catalogs for cross - checking . the spectroscopic catalogs cover the entire hdf - n plus a substantial fraction of the flanking fields region , whereas the photometric catalog only covers the hdf - n . we shall refer to these two samples as the spectroscopic sample \" and the photometric sample \" throughout the rest of this letter . for the spectroscopic sample , the -band magnitude was used to filter the sources by optical luminosity , as this is best matched to rest - frame over most of the redshift range under consideration here . the magnitudes are those given in barger et al . ( 1999 ) for the hawaii flanking fields area . for the photometric sample , the f814w ( hereafter ) magnitudes of fernndez - soto et al . ( 1999 ) were used . we chose galaxies which had no x - ray detection within 40 in the 0.58 kev ( full ) , 0.52 kev ( soft ) and 28 kev ( hard ) bands down to a wavdetect ( freeman et al . 2002 ) significance threshold of in the restricted acis grade set of paper iv . this low detection threshold ensures that our study does not include sources with x - ray emission just below the formal detection limits of paper v. we have attempted to construct a sample of galaxies similar to spiral galaxies in the local universe . to accomplish this , we have used the morphological classes of van den bergh et al . ( 2001 ) for galaxies from in the hdf - n and the flanking fields . to simplify the morphological filtering , we have cast objects in the van den bergh et al . ( 2001 ) catalog into the following four classes : ( 1 ) e / s0 \" and e \" , ( 2 ) merger \" , ( 3 ) sa\"sc \" , including proto - spirals and spiral / irregulars , and ( 4 ) irr \" , peculiar \" and/or tadpole \" . we then filtered the catalog to keep only classes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . filtering the photometric sample is more difficult due to the faintness of many of the sources and problems due to morphological evolution with redshift . we have used the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) classifications of fernndez - soto et al . ( 2001 ) to exclude all galaxies of type e \" . comparison of the source lists reveals that , within the area covered by both , 70% of galaxies identified through the two methods are in common . since the evolution of x - ray properties with redshift is of interest , we have made an effort to study objects with comparable optical luminosities at different redshifts . this is particularly important due to the non - linear relationship between x - ray luminosity and -band luminosity for some types of spiral galaxies ( ; e.g. fabbiano & shapley 2001 ) . using the value of in the -band as determined by blanton et al . ( 2001 ) for a large sample of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey , we determined the value of in the -band . the sloan filter is best matched to ; the resulting value of in the band is . to ensure that our results are not sensitively dependent upon the galaxy sed used to determine the optical properties , we have used both the sa and sc galaxy seds of poggianti et al . ( 1997 ) to calculate and vs. for an galaxy using the synthetic photometry package synphot in iraf . these calculations are shown in figure . note the close similarity between the sa and sc tracks ; this is because the band corresponds to rest - frame in the middle of our redshift range . also plotted in figure 1 are the 151 galaxies in the spectroscopic sample with spiral or merger morphology having and the 651 galaxies in the photometric sample with sed class other than e \" having . these galaxies were filtered by optical flux to lie within 1.5 mags of the galaxy tracks discussed above ; the galaxy samples constructed assuming sa and sc seds were identical ( or nearly so ) for all redshifts up to . galaxies meeting the optical magnitude filter were then divided by redshift into several bins ; these bins were constructed to ensure that there were galaxies per bin . the number of galaxies , median redshift , median look - back time and median optical magnitude for each bin are listed in table 1 . in figure 1 , we mark all the objects in the sc sed sample with colors indicating the different redshift bins . table 1 also includes the number of galaxies rejected from each redshift bin due to the presence of an x - ray detection within 40 ; this exclusion radius ensures that our results will not be adversely affected by the wings of the psf of very bright x - ray sources . these galaxies satisfied both the optical magnitude and morphology filtering constraints and were rejected only due to x - ray detection . this exclusion criterion is very conservative , however , considering that our astrometry is accurate to in the area under consideration ( see paper v ) . to allow for the off - nuclear nature of some of the x - ray sources found in normal galaxies ( e.g. , paper iv ) , we consider galaxies to be highly confident x - ray detections if the x - ray source is within 15 of the galaxy s center this matching radius is also well matched to the chandra psf . off - axis for 0.52 kev and the 83% encircled - energy radius for 0.58 kev . ] we therefore also give the number of galaxies having an x - ray detection within 15 in table 1 . the x - ray imaging data at each position were stacked in the same manner as in paper vii , keeping the 30 pixels whose centers fall within an aperture of radius 15 . the detection significance in each band was assessed by performing 100,000 monte - carlo stacking simulations using local background regions as in paper vii . a source is considered to be significantly detected if the number of counts over background exceeds that of 99.99% of the simulations . no single source in the stacking sample appeared to dominate the distribution , demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection criteria . stacking of the galaxies in the redshift bins described in table and figure resulted in significant detections in the soft band for all of the redshift bins up to ( see table 2 ) . we also stacked galaxies in the redshift bin , but there was not a significant detection . the results for the two different spiral galaxy sed samples are nearly or exactly identical except for the detection in the highest redshift bin  . we adopt a power law for the calculation of x - ray fluxes and luminosities , assuming that these galaxies are similar to spiral galaxies in the local universe and have their x - ray emission dominated by x - ray binaries ( e.g. , kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ) . while there were several cases of significant detections in the full band , there were no highly significant detections in the hard band . given the variation of effective area and background rate with energy , the signal - to - noise ratio for sources with the assumed spectrum is highest in the soft band and lowest in the hard band , so this behavior is expected . the flux level of the soft - band detections for the spectroscopic sample is ( 56) erg s . the corresponding rest - frame 0.52 kev luminosities for the average galaxy are erg s for the lowest redshift bin and erg s for the highest redshift bin . for the photometric sample , the soft - band flux level of the detections is ( 35) erg s . we also give fluxes for the less significant detections in the full band for those redshift bins having highly significant soft - band detections . we have investigated the properties of the sources which were rejected from the stacking samples due to an x - ray detection at or near the position of the galaxy ( the numbers of such sources are given in the last column of table 1 ) . there are only 15 distinct galaxies with x - ray detections within 15 . of these 15 sources , three are broad - line agn , which are clearly not normal galaxies . one object has a photometric redshift which differs significantly from its spectroscopic redshift . since the optical properties of this object at its spectroscopic redshift place it outside our sample boundaries , we have rejected it . one object is very near another x - ray source which has been positively identified with a narrow - line agn . thus , there are a total of 10 normal \" galaxies positively identified with x - ray sources within this sample , consituting a small minority of the galaxies under study here . the worst case is in the lowest redshift bin where 15% of the galaxies had x - ray detections . figure shows a histogram of values calculated for both the stacking samples and the individually x - ray detected galaxies . the individually x - ray detected galaxy set does possibly contain some lower - luminosity agn , including the agn candidate ( see papers ii and iv ) . with the exception of the objects in the redshift bin with median , figure shows that typically the x - ray luminosities of the individually detected objects are on average much higher than those of the stacked galaxies ; they are sufficiently more luminous as to appear atypical of the normal galaxy population . for the lowest redshift bin , it is plausible that our results are moderately biased by the exclusion of the x - ray detected sources . in 4 , we therefore also give results which include the individually x - ray detected objects in the sample average for this lowest redshift bin . for additional comparison , we have considered the radio properties of the individually detected galaxies and the stacked galaxies using the catalogs of richards et al . ( 1998 ) and richards ( 2000 ) . the percentage of radio detections among the individually x - ray detected galaxies is higher than that among the stacked galaxies ( % vs. % ) . this possible difference between the two populations is significant at the 93% level as determined using the fisher exact probability test for two independent samples ( see siegel & castellan 1988 ) . due to the x - ray luminosity difference and possible difference in radio properties , and to the fact that these galaxies constitute a small minority of those under study , we are confident we have not biased our determination of the properties of the typical galaxy by omitting these x - ray detected objects from further consideration . in figure a , we plot the x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratio for each stacked detection , where is calculated for the rest - frame 0.52 kev band . we have also plotted our approximate sensitivity limit in figure a , which is simply the corresponding x - ray luminosity detection limit achieved for a 30 ms stacking analysis divided by . we do not expect to detect galaxies having less x - ray emission per unit -band luminosity than this value . for comparison with the local universe , we also plot the mean for spiral galaxies of comparable from the sample of shapley et al . this sample includes 234 spiral galaxies observed with einstein and excludes agn where the x - ray emission is clearly dominated by the nucleus . the galaxies in the shapley et al . ( 2001 ) sample all have ; median redshift is . in figure b , we plot versus ; the values up to are consistent with what is observed in the shapley et al . sample for objects with comparable , although they are toward the high end of what is observed . this is consistent with figure a , which shows the average derived from stacking being somewhat higher than that for the shapley et al . galaxies of comparable optical luminosity . there is a slight increase ( factor of 1.6 ) in the average from the local universe to . for the highest redshift bin  , the results become somewhat sensitive to the galaxy sed one assumes for determining the optical properties . we suspect that an sc galaxy sed is more appropriate at this epoch due to the higher prevalence of star formation . adopting this sed , we find that has increased somewhat more substantially ( times ) at . one may also constrain star - formation models using only the x - ray properties of these galaxies . the average x - ray luminosity of the spiral galaxies in the shapley et al . ( 2001 ) sample having the same range of as used in this study is erg s ( converted to 0.52 kev ) . the average galaxy in our stacking sample has a luminosity times higher at . this increases to times higher at . the value is most likely affected by some bias due to the exclusion of legitimate normal galaxies in the lowest redshift bin ( see 3 ) . if we include these individually x - ray detected objects , then the average galaxy in our stacking sample has a luminosity times higher at , consistent with the predictions of ghosh & white ( 2001 ) that the x - ray luminosity of the typical sa - sbc spiral galaxy should be times higher at . including the x - ray detected galaxies does not significantly affect our results for the interval ( the difference is % ) . however , since the x - ray luminosities of the x - ray detected objects with are substantially higher ( by an order of magnitude ) than the x - ray stacking averages ( see figure 2 ) , it is not appropriate to include these objects in the calculation of the average x - ray luminosity . we thus find a smaller increase in the average x - ray luminosity of galaxies at than the increase by a factor of predicted by ghosh & white ( 2001 ) . we find that the average x - ray luminosities of galaxies have not evolved upward by more than a factor of by , regardless of exclusion or inclusion of x - ray detected objects . the range of average 0.52 kev fluxes for the spiral galaxies studied here is ( erg s . these x - ray fluxes are consistent with independent predictions made by ptak et al . ( 2001 ) that galaxies of this type will be detected at 0.52 kev flux levels of erg s ( converted from their 210 kev prediction assuming a power law ) . assuming a 0.52 kev xrb flux density of erg s deg ( garmire et al . 2001 ) , we have identified % of the soft xrb as arising from spiral galaxies not yet individually detected in deep surveys . many of these objects should be sufficently bright to be detected with acis exposures of ms , which should be achievable in the next several years of the mission . we thank alice shapley for useful discussions and sharing data . we gratefully acknowledge the financial support of nasa grant nas 8 - 38252 ( gpg , pi ) , nasa gsrp grant ngt5 - 50247 ( aeh ) , nsf career award ast-9983783 ( wnb , dma , feb ) , and nsf grant ast99 - 00703 ( dps ) . this work would not have been possible without the enormous efforts of the entire team . ccccccc + 0.400.75 & sc & 0.635 & 6.34 & 21.73 & 29 & 12/6 + 0.750.90 & sc & 0.821 & 7.39 & 21.83 & 38 & 2/2 + 0.901.10 & sc & 0.960 & 8.05 & 22.29 & 30 & 6/4 + + + 0.501.00 & sc & 0.920 & 7.87 & 22.99 & 37 & 9/4 + 1.001.50 & sc & 1.200 & 8.97 & 24.28 & 64 & 6/2 + 1.001.50 & sa & 1.240 & 9.09 & 24.69 & 80 & 8/2 + rrrrrrrrrcrrc + 0.400.75 & sc & 49.6 & 31.7 & 99.99 & & 25.41 & 25.44 & 1.52 & 0.65 & 2.94 & 1.26 & 0.67 + 0.750.90 & sc & 58.0 & 36.4 & & & 33.05 & 33.09 & 1.36 & 0.57 & 4.92 & 2.07 & 1.33 + 0.901.10 & sc & 54.4 & 25.9 & & & 26.54 & 26.56 & 1.60 & 0.51 & 8.44 & 2.68 & 1.40 + + + 0.501.00 & sc & 42.0 & 33.5 & 99.77 & & 34.51 & 34.54 & 0.95 & 0.51 & 4.51 & 2.40 & 1.12 + 1.001.50 & sc & 44.8 & 38.5 & 98.94 & & 59.67 & 59.73 & 0.58 & 0.34 & 5.34 & 3.06 & 0.79 + 1.001.50 & sa & 45.6 & 34.2 & 98.29 & 99.95 & 74.61 & 74.68 & 0.48 & 0.24 & 4.70 & 2.36 & 0.81 + . the blue curves give vs. for sa and sc galaxies ( the lower curve at higher redshift is for the sa galaxy ) . galaxies without a colored circle were not included in the stacking sample because they either were not within the range of optical luminosity specified or because an x - ray detection was found within 40 .

{"article": "topological phase of condensed matter systems is a quantum many - body state with nontrivial momentum or real space topology in the hilbert spaces . recent newly discovered topological superconductor ( tsc ) has spawned considerable interests since this kind of topological phase supports the emergence of majorana fermion ( mf ) which is a promising candidate for the fault - tolerant topological quantum computation ( tqc ) . there are several proposals for hosting mfs in tsc , for example , chiral -wave superconductor , cu - doped topological insulator , superconducting proximity devices and noncentrosymmetric superconductor ( ncs ) . the signatures of mfs have also been reported in the superconducting insb nanowire , and topological insulator josephson junction . to obtain a readily manipulated majorana platform for tqc , more experimental confirmations and theoretical proposals are therefore highly desirable . in this paper , we study the topological phase and majorana fermion at the edge and in the vortex core of the -wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) spin - orbit ( so ) coupled ncs . it is found that the asymmetric so interaction plays a crucial role in realizing topological phases in the ncs . although the rashba so coupled ncs has been previously investigated , the dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled ncs is relatively less discussed theoretically . interestingly , we find that there is a novel semimetal phase in the dresselhaus ncs , where the energy gap closes in the whole region and different kinds of flat andreev bound states ( abss ) emerge . we demonstrate that these flat abss support the emergence of mfs analytically and numerically . it is known that the chern number is not a well - defined topological invariant in the gapless region , however , we find that the topologically different semimetal phases in this gapless region can still be distinguished by the pfaffian invariant of the particle - hole symmetric hamiltonian . several authors have proposed the flat abss in the ncs with high order so couplings , -wave superconductor , -wave superconductor and -wave superconductor . instead , our proposal for hosting the flat abss is an -wave dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupled ncs in an in - plane magnetic field which is more flexible than the previous proposals where one needs to apply a magnetic field in the direction to the materials . our proposal is experimentally more feasible . the flat dispersion implies a peak in the density of states ( dos ) which is clearly visible and has an experimental signature in the tunneling conductance measurements . the zero - bias conductance peak has been observed in recent experiments on the insb nanowire and and argued to be due to the flat abs . thus if the majorana fermion exists in the dresselhaus ncs , the flat abs and the zero - bias conductance peak in the dos predicted here should be detectable . the paper is organized as follows . the model for -wave ncs with dresselhaus ( 110 ) so coupling is given in sec . . the phase diagrams and topological invariants of this model are discussed in sec . the numerical and analytical solutions to the majorana fermions at the edge of the system are demonstrated in sec . . the majorana fermions in the vortex core of the system are numerically shown in sec . . finally , we give a brief summary in sec . . we begin with modeling the hamiltonian in a square lattice for the two dimensional -wave ncs with dresselhaus ( 110 ) so interaction in an in - plane magnetic field , which is given by : ,\\\\ \\ ] ] where denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron with spin at site . is the hopping term with hopping amplitude and chemical potential . is the zeeman field induced by the in -

{"article": "the discovery of topological insulators in 2d and 3d has recently attracted a great deal of attention ( reference therein ) . the appearance of the gapless edge states within the bulk gap is generally believed to be a signature of the topological insulator . generally speaking , a topological insulator has gapless robust edge states while it s energy spectrum is gapped in the bulk . the bulk energy gap closes if a system is deformed adiabatically to a topologically nonequivalent system . remarkably , topological phase is not restricted to two and three dimensional systems . of special importance in the context of localization and topological phase in 1d is the aubry and andre ( aa ) model . a mapping of the 1d aa model to topologically - nontrivial 2d quantum hall ( qh ) system was constructed and used to topologically classify 1d quasicrystals . topological equivalence between crystal and quasicrystal band structures and between the fibonacci quasicrystal and the harper model were shown . recently , the parameter range for a off - diagonal gapless aa model that can not be mapped onto a qh system was explored . + the periodic table of topological insulators has been constructed only for hermitian hamiltonians . this is because of the fact that hermiticity was required in quantum mechanics to guarantee the reality of the spectrum . however , it was shown in 1998 that hermiticity requirement is replaced by the analogous condition of symmetry , where and operators are parity and time reversal operators , respectively . in 2010 , a non - hermitian system was experimentally realized in an optical system . it is well known that a symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian admits real spectrum as long as non - hermitian degree is below than a critical number . therefore , a natural question arises . does there exist a topologically nontrivial system described by non - hermitian hamiltonian ? this problem was considered by some authors . hu and hughes and esaki et al . studied non - hermitian generalization of topologically insulating phase at almost the same time . the main finding of these papers is that topological states do nt exist in the symmetric region because of the existence of complex energy eigenvalues . in , they considered dirac - type hamiltonians and concluded that the appearance of the complex eigenvalues is an indication of the non - existence of the topological insulator phase in non - hermitian models . they discussed that finding non - hermitian topological phases without dirac - type hamiltonians could be possible . esaki et al . considered tight binding honeycomb lattice with imaginary onsite potentials and non - hermitian generalizations of the luttinger hamiltonian and kane - mele model . they found that the zero energy edge states are robust against small non - hermitian perturbation , while these states decay because of the imaginary part of eigenvalues . in 2012 , ghosh studied topological phase in some non - hermitian system by changing the metric of the hilbert space i.e. modifying the inner product . schomerus considered a one dimensional non - hermitian tight binding lattice with staggered tunneling amplitude and showed that the system admits complex spectrum . another attempt has recently been made to find non - hermitian hamiltonian admitting topological insulator phase . zhu , lu and chen specifically considered non - hermitian su - schrieffer - heeger model with two conjugated imaginary potential located at the edges of the system . they found that zero energy modes are unstable and corresponding energy eigenvalues are not real in the topologically nontrivial region . in all of these papers , no example of topological edge states for a non - hermitian system with a real spectrum has been found . the existence of topological phase transition for symmetric non - hermitian systems is still an important question . in the present paper , we consider a non - hermitian generalization of the off - diagonal aubry andre model . in contrast to general belief , we find topological edge states in the symmetric region , i.e. topological edge states with real spectrum . this is the first example in the literature where topological states are compatible with symmetry . we consider tight binding description of a symmetric lattice . let us begin with the 1d off - diagonal aa model . this is a 1d tight binding model with modulated tunneling parameter . in addition , suppose two non - hermitian impurities are inserted in the system . the impurities are balanced gain and loss materials . we require that the non - hermitian impurities are arranged at symmetrical sites with respect to the center of the lattice , i.e. , particles are injected on the -th site and removed from the -th site , where is the number of lattice sites . the hamiltonian reads where the parameter represents non - hermitian degree , is unmodulated tunneling amplitude , and denote the creation and annihilation operators of fermionic particles on site , respectively . the first term in the hamiltonian is the kinetic energy from the nearest - neighbor tunneling and the last term is the non - hermitian potential due to two non - hermitian impurities . the constant is the strength of the modulation and controls the periodicity of the modulation . the modulation is periodical if is rational and quasi - periodical if it is irrational . as it is usual on the topic of topological insulator in 1d , the modulation phase is an additional degree of freedom . + below , we will find energy spectrum of this hamiltonian numerically . we adopt open boundary conditions with and being the two edge sites . note that the translational invariance of the system is broken for open boundary conditions . before going into the details , let us study the symmetry of the hamiltonian qualitatively . it is clear that the system has no parity symmetry when the tunneling is modulated quasi - periodically . therefore , the hamiltonian is not symmetric when is irrational . consider now periodical modulation of tunneling . for finite number of , the particles on the two ends of the chain may not have the same tunneling to their nearest neighbors . furthermore , particles injected on site and to be lost from site may feel different tunneling depending on and . therefore , we say that the system with edges does nt generally possess global symmetry in the usual sense . for example , for , the system is invariant under usual operation when but not when and . it is well known in the theory of symmetric quantum theory that a commuting anti - linear operator can be found for a non - hermitian hamiltonian if the spectrum is real . the associated anti - linear symmetry can be interpreted as symmetry . we will show that our system admits real spectrum for some particular cases . + , and when and sites . topological zero energy edge states appear in the whole region of when the site number is odd . , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , , and when and sites . topological zero energy edge states appear in the whole region of when the site number is odd . , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , , sites and . observe that topological zero energy states appear in the unbroken symmetric phase if . note that the spectrum would be real valued when if .,title=\"fig:\",width=162 ] , , , sites and . observe that topological zero energy states appear in the unbroken symmetric phase if . note that the spectrum would be real valued when if .,title=\"fig:\",width=166 ] , , , sites and . observe that topological zero energy states appear in the unbroken symmetric phase if . note that the spectrum would be real valued when if .,title=\"fig:\",width=162 ] , , , sites and . observe that topological zero energy states appear in the unbroken symmetric phase if . note that the spectrum would be real valued when if .,title=\"fig:\",width=166 ] , , sites and . at this value of the non -

hermitian hamiltonian . since the symmetry is broken for quasi - periodical tunneling , we consider periodical tunneling parameter . let us start with , where the tunneling alternates at fixed between the two values and . hence , the corresponding spectrum has two energy bands . suppose first that the system is hermitian , . in this case , our model is reduced to the well known su - schreier - heeger model ( ssh ) . we plot the energy spectrum as a function of the phase in the fig.1 . as can be seen , the system has maximum band gap at and the bulk gap closes and reopens as changes . remarkably , zero energy states appear in the spectrum . it is well known that these zero - energy states are localized around the two edges of the system . this is a signature of topologically nontrivial phase . the region of nontrivial topological phase depends on whether the number of lattice sites is odd or even . if is odd , zero energy edge states appear for all . however , this is not case if is even . the zero energy edge state exists at and varying leads to the topological phase transitions that occur at and . the region corresponds to topologically trivial phase . let us now study the existence of edge states if the two non - hermitian impurities are introduced into the system . we are looking for topological edge states with real energy eigenvalues . we expect that the effect of impurities on the real part of energy spectrum is not appreciable provided is large and is not much bigger than the tunneling parameter . to check this idea and study the reality of the spectrum , we present numerical calculation for odd and even number of lattice sites . we see that zero energy states exist even in the presence of the non - hermitian impurities . however , we are not interested in zero energy states in broken symmetric region . we are looking for such states in the unbroken symmetric region . the key point here is the site position of particle injection and removal . more precisely , where we inject and remove particles has almost nothing to do with the real part of spectrum but plays a vital role on the reality of the spectrum . this can be seen clearly in the fig.2 and fig.3 . let us start our discussion with the case of , i.e. , the particles are injected to the one edge and lost from the other edge . in this case , the symmetric phase is spontaneously broken and the spectrum becomes complex in the topologically nontrivial region whereas the spectrum is real as long as is below than a critical number in the topologically trivial region . as a result , we say that the spectrum is complex in the whole region of the phase ( in the region ) when is an odd ( even ) number . secondly , let us now suppose that the gain / loss occurs at , where are positive integers ( for ) . it is remarkable that the spectrum becomes real in the whole region of the phase provided that non - hermitian degree is below than a critical number , . the critical numbers for even and odd values of are almost the same and slightly changes if we increase . however , it decreases with the modulation strength and vanishes if . at fixed and , decreases also with increasing . the maximum value of occurs when the non - hermitian impurities are on the nearest neighbors of the edges , i.e. , at . ( for and decreases with increasing ) . as a final step , we numerically confirm that the zero energy states are localized around the two edges of the lattice . the main finding of this paper is that our system has nontrivial topological edge states in the unbroken symmetric region . to this end , we note that is either very small or zero when is not equal to . the only exception is the one when the impurities are on the two symmetrical neighboring sites with respect to the center of the lattice . in this case , when and when . if we change , the critical value changes drastically . + we show that the position of non - hermitian impurities has dramatic effect on the reality of the spectrum for . we can extend our previous analysis for other values of , where is a positive integer . in this case , energy spectrum is split into bands . we stress that topological zero energy edge modes do nt exist when is an odd number . below we first study the reality of the spectrum when is an odd number and then discuss topological phase when is an even number . as an example consider , where there are three bands that are crossed as the phase sweeps from zero to . in the presence of impurities , the real part of the spectrum is almost left unchanged provided is not much bigger than tunneling amplitude . compared to the case with , the impurity lattice sites necessary for the reality of the spectrum are shifted according to the formula , where the critical number decreases with increasing . we note that the site number plays also a role on the reality of the spectrum . to understand better , suppose that particles on the one edge of the system feel tunneling with amplitude . depending on the number , particles on the other edge of the lattice feel either the same tunneling or one of following tunnelings with amplitudes , . so , there are three different configurations at fixed and we should calculate the spectrum separately for three different consecutive numbers . as an example , we take , and and . we numerically see that the spectrum is real when unless ( at ) and symmetry is broken since the spectrum is complex for and . analogously , we expect a similar picture if since the same configuration is obtained . therefore , the spectrum is real if n equals to . . and , where the critical number slightly changes with . suppose now that is an even number . we are mainly interested in this case since topological zero energy states are available . let us study the reality of the spectrum . as an example , consider , where the impurity lattice sites necessary for the reality of the spectrum are given by . the spectrum becomes real if . and the critical values changes slightly with at fixed . the critical value for ( at and ) and decreases with . as a result , we say that topological zero energy states exist when is even and we show that the corresponding spectrum becomes real under certain conditions . + it is worthwhile to point out that the topological phase in the unbroken symmetric phase can be broken by the next - nearest - neighbor tunneling . we introduce next - nearest - neighbor tunneling to the off - diagonal symmetric aa model model . the new hamiltonian reads where is given by  and is the next - nearest - neighbor tunneling constant . suppose the next - nearest - neighbor tunneling parameter is site independent . without any loss of generality we assume the next - nearest - neighbor tunneling is constant . the energy of the edge states are not zero anymore and the particle - hole symmetry is lost since next - nearest - neighbor tunneling contributes the energy spectrum perturbatively . introducing non - hermitian impurities into the system breaks the symmetry spontaneously in the presence of next - nearest - neighbor tunneling . although edge states are still robust as a direct result of the topological nature , complex eigenvalues appear in the system . fortunately , the imaginary part of energy eigenvalues are very small in a broad range of if . for example , for the parameters , , , , and , the imaginary part of energy eigenvalues are at the order of when and when . + , . the site number changes the particular values of the phase where the bands are crossed.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] , , . the site number changes the particular values of the phase where the bands are crossed.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] so far , we have omitted quasi - periodical modulation of the tunneling parameter since the system is not symmetric when is irrational . here , we prove numerically that the spectrum is complex for this case . in the absence of non - hermitian impurities , the energy spectrum is broken into fractal set of bands and gaps due to the quasi periodical nature of the tunneling parameter . as shown in the fig.4 , the bands remains almost the same but they are connected by the edge states as shifts adiabatically from zero to . the states within the band gap are localized states either on the right or the left edge of the lattice , while the states within the bands are extended . in the presence of non - hermitian potential , we numerically check that the real part of the spectrum is almost unchanged as long as the non - hermitian degree is weak . however , we see that complex eigenvalues appear whenever is different from zero . we repeat our calculations for different values of site number and we see no signature of nontrivial topological phase with real spectrum . + as an another example where quasi - periodicity breaks the symmetry , let us consider a non - hermitian generalization of the diagonal aubry andre model where we suppose is irrational . for this hamiltonian , tunneling parameter is constant but the onsite potential is quasi - periodic . it is well known that the hermitian model exhibits a localization transition at when the modulation is quasi - periodic . all bulk eigenstates are extended for and localized for . the energy spectrum as a function of consists of fractal set of bands and within the band gap edge states appear . in the presence of non - hermitian impurities , the spectrum becomes complex . we perform extensive numerical calculation but we did not find topologically nontrivial phase with real spectrum . + we have discussed that topological zero energy edge states appear in our system when . to understand the topological origin of the edge states for , let us rewrite the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the majorana basis , where the annihilation operators at site and are defined by , . the two new operators and are two species of majorana fermions at site . therefore the hamiltonian ( 1 ) without the non - hermitian term becomes , where . this hamiltonian describes two uncoupled identical majorana chains and the system has topological index when . the majorana physics is most easily understood in the limit . in this case , the system has two unpaired majorana operators in each uncoupled chains , , and , . so , zero energy majorana fermions localized at the edges appear . however , non - hermitian interaction term includes a coupling term between these unpaired majorana operators if non - hermitian impurities are placed at the edges , . therefore the corresponding eigenvalues become complex valued . if the non - hermitian impurities are placed such that , then the non - hermitian term of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the majorana basis contains a coupling term . since it does nt contain unpaired majorana operators , the system admits real energy eigenvalues if the non - hermitian degree is smaller than a critical value . + to sum up , we have studied the non - hermitian generalization of aubry andre model . in this paper , we have shown a novel topological aspect for the non - hermitian generalization of the aubry andre model . we have shown that the system can undergo a topological phase transition in the symmetric region by varying the lattice position of the non - hermitian impurities . we think photonic crystals could be used to observe the topological edge states for our model . our system is the first example in the literature and it is worth to look for other topologically nontrivial symmetric systems with real spectra . another important task is to extend the periodic table of topological insulator to non - hermitian hamiltonians . 0 m. z. hasan and c. l. kane , rev . * 82 * 3045 ( 2010 ) . s. aubry and g. andre , ann . . soc . * 3 * 133 ( 1980 ) . y. e. kraus , y. lahini , z. ringel , m. verbin , and o. zilberberg , phys . * 109 * 106402 ( 2012 ) . lang and s. chen , phys . b * 86 * 205135 ( 2012 ) . kevin a. madsen , emil j. bergholtz , and piet w. brouwer , phys . b * 88 * 125118 ( 2013 ) . y. e. kraus and o. zilberberg , phys . lett . * 109 * 116404 ( 2012 ) . sriram ganeshan , kai sun , and s. das sarma , phys . lett . * 110 * 180403 ( 2013 ) . li -

{"article": "in the past decade , observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ; riess et al . 1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations ( bennett et al . 2003 ; spergel et al . 2003 , 2007 ) , and large - scale structures ( lss ; tegmark et al . 2004 , 2006 ) have been used to explore cosmology extensively . these observations are found to be consistent with the so - called concordance cosmology , in which the universe is spatially flat and contains pressureless matter and dark energy , with fractional energy densities of and ( davis et al . observations of sn ia provide a powerful probe in the modern cosmology . phillips ( 1993 ) found that there is an intrinsic relation between the peak luminosity and the shape of the light curve of sne ia . this relation and other similar luminosity relations make sne ia standard candles for measuring the geometry and dynamics of the universe . however , the maximum redshift of the sne ia which we can currently use is only about 1.7 , whereas fluctuations of the cmb provide the cosmological information from last scattering surface at . therefore , the earlier universe at higher redshift may not be well - studied without data from standardized candles in the `` cosmological desert '' from the sne ia redshift limit to . gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most intense explosions observed so far . their high energy photons in the gamma - ray band are almost immune to dust extinction , whereas in the case of sn ia observations , there is extinction from the interstellar medium when optical photons propagate towards us . moreover , grbs are likely to occur in the high - redshift range up to at least ( krimm et al . 2006 ) ; higher redshift grbs up to should have already been detected , although none have been identified ( lamb & reichart 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 , 2006 ; lin , zhang , & li 2004 ) . thus , by using grbs , we may explore the early universe in the high redshift range which is difficult to access by other cosmological probes . these advantages make grbs attractive for cosmology research . grb luminosity / energy relations are connections between measurable properties of the prompt gamma - ray emission and the luminosity or energy . in recent years , several empirical grb luminosity relations have been proposed as distance indicators ( see e.g. ghirlanda et al . 2006a ; schaefer ( 2007 ) for reviews ) , such as the luminosity - spectral lag ( - ) relation ( norris , marani , & bonnell 2000 ) , the luminosity - variability ( - ) relation ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ; reichart et al . 2001 ) , the isotropic energy - peak spectral energy ( ( - ) relation ( i.e. , the so - called amati relation , amati et al . 2002 ) , the collimation - corrected energy - peak spectral energy ( - ) relation ( i.e. , the so - called ghirlanda et al . 2004a ) , the - relation ( schaefer 2003a ; yonetoku et al . 2004 ) , and two multi - variable relations . the first of these multiple relations is between , and the break time of the optical afterglow light curves ( i.e. , the so - called liang - zhang relation , liang & zhang 2005 ) ; the other is between luminosity , and the rest - frame `` high - signal '' timescale  ( firmani et al . 2006 ) . several authors have made use of these grb luminosity indicators as standard candles at very high redshift for cosmology research ( e.g. schaefer 2003b ; dai et al . 2004 ; ghirlanda et al . 2004b ; firmani et al . 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ; liang & zhang 2005 ; xu et al . 2005 ; wang & dai 2006 ; see also e.g. ghirlanda et al . 2006a and schaefer ( 2007 ) for reviews ) . schaefer ( 2003b ) derived the luminosity distances of nine grbs with known redshifts by using two grb luminosity relations to construct the first grb hubble diagram . dai et al . ( 2004 ) considered the ghirlanda relation with 12 bursts and proposed another approach to constrain cosmological parameters . liang & zhang ( 2005 ) constrained cosmological parameters and the transition redshift using the -- relation . more recently , schaefer ( 2007 ) used five grb relations calibrated with 69 grbs by assuming two adopted cosmological models to obtain the derived distance moduli for plotting the hubble diagram , and joint constraints on the cosmological parameters and dark energy models have been derived in many works by combining the 69 grb data with sne ia and the other cosmological probes , such as the cmb anisotropy , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak , the x - ray gas mass fraction in clusters , the linear growth rate of perturbations , and the angular diameter distances to radio galaxies ( wright 2007 ; wang et al . 2007 ; li et al . 2008 ; qi et al . 2008 ; daly et al . 2008 ) . however , an important point related to the use of grbs for cosmology is the dependence on the cosmological model in the calibration of grb relations . in the case of sn ia cosmology , the calibration is carried out with a sample of sne ia at very low redshift where the luminosities of sne ia are essentially independent of any cosmological model ( i.e. , at , the luminosity distance has a negligible dependence on the choice of the model ) . however , in the case of grbs , the observed long - grb rate falls off rapidly at low redshifts , and some nearby grbs may be intrinsically different ( e.g. , grb 980425 , grb 031203 ; norris 2002 ; soderberg et al . 2004 ; guetta et al . 2004 ; liang & zhang 2006a ) . therefore , it is very difficult to calibrate the relations with a low - redshift sample . the relations of grbs presented above have been calibrated by assuming a particular cosmological model ( e.g. the cdm model ) . in order to investigate cosmology , the relations of standard candles should be calibrated in a cosmological model - independent way . otherwise , the circularity problem can not easily be avoided . many of the works mentioned above treat the circularity problem with a statistical approach . a simultaneous fit of the parameters in the calibration curves and the cosmology is carried out to find the optimal grb relation and the optimal cosmological model in the sense of a minimum scattering in both the luminosity relations and the hubble diagram . firmani et al . ( 2005 ) has also proposed a bayesian method to get around the circularity problem . ( 2008b ) presented another new method to deal with the problem , using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) global fitting analysis . instead of a hybrid sample over the whole redshift range of grbs , takahashi et al . ( 2003 ) first calibrated two grb relations at low redshift  , where distance - redshift relations have been already determined from sn ia ; they then used grbs at high redshift  as a distance indicator . bertolami & silva ( 2006 ) considered the use of grbs at calibrated with the bursts at as distance markers to study the unification of dark energy and dark matter in the context of the generalized chaplygin gas model . schaefer ( 2007 ) made a detailed comparison between the hubble diagram calibrated only with 37 bursts at and the one calibrated with the data from all 69 grbs to show that the results from fits to the grb hubble diagram calibrated with the hybrid sample are robust . these calibration methods above carried out with the sample at low redshifts have been derived from the cdm model . however , we note that the circularity problem can not be circumvented completely by means of statistical approaches , because a particular cosmology model is required in doing the joint fitting . this means that the parameters of the calibrated relations are still coupled to the cosmological parameters derived from a given cosmological model . in principle , the circularity problem can be avoided in two ways ( ghirlanda et al . 2006a ) : ( 1 ) through a solid physical interpretation of these relations that would fix their slope independently from cosmological model , or ( 2 ) through the calibration of these relations by several low - redshift grbs . recently the possibility of calibrating the standard candles using grbs in a low - dispersion in redshift near a fiducial redshift has been proposed ( lamb et al . 2005 ; ghirlanda et al . liang & zhang ( 2006b ) elaborated this method further based on bayesian theory . however , the grb sample available now is far from what is needed to calibrate the relations in this way . as analyzed above , due to the lack of low - redshift grbs , the methods used in grb luminosity relations for cosmology are different from the standard hubble diagram method used in sn ia cosmology . in this work , we present a new method to calibrate the grb relations in a cosmological model - independent way . in the case of sn ia cosmology , the distance of nearby sne ia used to calibrate the luminosity relations can be obtained by measuring cepheid variables in the same galaxy , and with other distance indicators . thus , cepheid variables have been regarded as the first - order standard candles for calibrating sne ia , the second - order standard candles . it is obvious that objects at the same redshift should have the same luminosity distance in any cosmology . for calibrating grbs , there are so many sne ia ( e.g. , 192 sne ia used in davis et al . 2007 ) that we can obtain the distance moduli ( also the luminosity distance ) at any redshift in the redshift range of sne ia by interpolating from sn ia data in the hubble diagram . furthermore , the distance moduli of sne ia obtained directly from observations are completely cosmological model independent . therefore , in the same sense as cepheid variables and sne ia , if we regard sne ia as the first order standard candles , we can obtain the distance moduli of grbs in the redshift range of sne ia and calibrate grb relations in a completely cosmological model - independent way . then if we further assume that these calibrated grb relations are still valid in the whole redshift range of grbs , just as for sne ia , we can use the standard hubble diagram method to constrain the cosmological parameters from the grb data at high redshift obtained by utilizing the relations . the structure of this paper is arranged as follow . in section 2 , we calibrate seven grb luminosity / energy relations with the sample at obtained by interpolating from sne ia data in the hubble diagram . in section 3 , we construct the hubble diagram of grbs obtained by using the interpolation methods and constrain cosmological parameters . conclusions and a discussion are given in section 4 . we adopt the data for 192 sne ia ( riess et al . 2007 ; wood - vasey et al . 2007 ; astier et al . 2007 , davis et al . 2007 ) , shown in figure 1 . it is clear that for grbs in the redshift range of sne ia , there are enough data sn ia points and the redshift intervals of the neighboring sn ia data points are also small enough , to be able to use interpolation methods to obtain the distance moduli of grbs . since there is only one sn ia point at ( the redshift of sn1997ff is ) , we initially exclude it from our sn ia sample used to interpolate the distance moduli of grbs in the redshift range of the sn ia sample ( 191 sne ia data at ) . as the distance moduli of sne ia data in the hubble diagram are obtained directly from observations , with the sample at by interpolating from the hubble diagram of sne ia , we can therefore calibrate grb luminosity relations in a completely cosmology - independent way . in this section , we calibrate seven grb luminosity / energy relations with the sample at , i.e. , the - relation , the - relation , the - relation , the - relation , the - relation , where is the minimum rise time in the grb light curve ( schaefer , 2007 ) , the - relation , and the -- relation . the isotropic luminosity of a burst is calculated by where is the luminosity distance of the burst and is the bolometric flux of gamma - rays in the burst . the isotropic energy released from a burst is given by where is the bolometric fluence of gamma - rays in the burst at redshift . the total collimation - corrected energy is then calculated by where the beaming factor , is with the jet opening angle  , which is related to the break time  . a grb luminosity relation can be generally written in the form where and are the intercept and slope of the relation respectively ; is the luminosity ( in units of ) or energy ( or in units of ) ; is the grb parameters measured in the rest frame , e.g. , , , , , , for the 6 two - variable relations above . we adopt the data for these quantities from schaefer ( 2007 ) . for the one multi - variable relation ( i.e. , -- ) , the calibration equation is where and are , respectively , and and are the slopes of and respectively . the error of the interpolated distance modulus of a grb must account for the original uncertainties of the sne ia as well as for the uncertainties from the interpolation . when the linear interpolation is used , the error can be calculated by ^ 2\\epsilon {\\mu , i}^2+^2\\epsilon {\\mu , i+1}^2)^{1/2},\\ ] ] where is the error of the interpolated distance modulus , is the interpolated distance modulus of a source at redshift , and are errors of the sne , and are the distance moduli of the sne at nearby redshifts and respectively . when the cubic interpolation is used , the error can be calculated by where , , , and are errors of the sne ; and , , , and are the distance moduli of the sne at nearby redshifts , , , and : / ] ; / ] . are obtained by interpolating from sn ia data ( black circles : the cubic interpolation method ; black stars : the linear interpolation method ) ; and the 42 gbrs at ( blue circles ) are obtained with the five relations calibrated with the sample at using the cubic interpolation method . the curve is the theoretical distance modulus in the concordance model ( , , ) , and the vertical dotted line represents . , scaledwidth=47.0% ] we determine the values of the intercept  and the slope  with their 1- uncertainties calibrated with the grb sample at by using two interpolation methods ( the linear interpolation methods and the cubic interpolation method ) . for the 6 two - variable relations we use the same method ( the bisector of the two ordinary least - squares ) as used in schaefer ( 2007 ) , and for the one multi - variable relation , the multiple variable regression analysis is used . the bisector of the two ordinary least - squares ( isobe et al . , 1990 ) does not take the errors into account ; but the use of weighted least - squares , taking into account the measurable uncertainties , results in almost identical best fits . however , taking into account the measurable uncertainties in the regression , when they are smaller than the intrinsic error , indeed will not change the fitting parameters significantly ( for further discussion , see schaefer 2007 ) . the calibration results are summarized in table 1 , and we plot the grb data at with the distance moduli obtained by using the two interpolation methods from sn ia data in figure 1 for comparison . in the previous treatment , the distance moduli of grbs are obtained by assuming a particular cosmological model with a hybrid sample in the whole redshift range of grbs to calibrate the relations . therefore , for comparison in table 1 we also list the results calibrated with the same sample  assuming the cdm model  or the riess cosmology ( , riess et al . 2004 ) , which were used to calibrate the five grb relations in schaefer ( 2007 ) . the calibration results obtained by using the interpolation methods are carried out with the 27 grbs at , namely , 13 , 19 , 25 , 12 , 24 , 12 , and 12 grbs for the - , - , - , - , - , - , and -- relations respectively;- relation . ] therefore , the uncertainties of the results are somewhat larger than those with the hybrid grb sample . uncertainty for the five grb relations with 69 grbs  obtained by assuming the cdm model in schaefer ( 2007 ) are also given in table 1 , for comparison . ] the linear correlation coefficients of the calibration with the sample at using the cubic interpolation methods are -0.88 , 0.65 , 0.89 , 0.94 , -0.75 , and 0.68 for the above 6 two - variable relations respectively , and 0.94 for vs. the combined variable ( + b 2\\log$ ] ) for the -- relation , which shows that these correlations are significant . from table 1 and figure 1 , we find that the calibration results obtained using the linear interpolation methods are almost identical to the results calibrated by using the cubic interpolation method . we also find the results obtained by assuming the two cosmological models with the same sample differ only slightly from , but are still fully consistent with , those calibrated using our interpolation methods . the reason for this is easy to understand , since both cosmological models are fully compatible with sn ia data . nevertheless , it should be noticed that the calibration results obtained using the interpolation methods directly from sn ia data are completely cosmology independent . if we further assum grb luminosity / energy relations do not evolve with redshift , we are able to obtain the luminosity  or energy ( or ) of each burst at high redshift  by utilizing the calibrated relations . therefore , the luminosity distance  can be derived from equation ( 1 ) . the uncertainty of the value of the luminosity or energy deduced from a grb relation is where , and are 1- uncertainty of the intercept , the slope and the grb measurable parameters , and is the systematic error in the fitting that accounts for the extra scatter of the luminosity relations . the value of can be estimated by finding the value such that a fit to the calibration curve produces a value of reduced of unity ( schaefer 2007 ) . a distance modulus can be calculated as ( where is in mpc ) . the propagated uncertainties will depend on whether or is used : ^{1/2},\\ ] ] or ^{1/2},\\ ] ] and ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] we use the same method as used in schaefer ( 2007 ) to obtain the best estimate for each grb which is the weighted average of all available distance moduli . the derived distance modulus for each grb is with its uncertainty , where the summations run from 1 to 5 over the five relations used in schaefer ( 2007 ) with available data . we have plotted the hubble diagram of the 69 grbs obtained using the interpolation methods in figure 1 . the 27 grbs at are obtained by using two interpolation methods directly from sne data . the 42 grb data at are obtained by utilizing the five relations calibrated with the sample at using the cubic interpolation method . then the cosmological parameters can be fitted by the minimum method . the definition of is in which is the theoretical value of distance modulus , is the observed distance modulus with its error . the theoretical value of the distance modulus  depends on the theoretical value of luminosity distance . for the cdm model , the luminosity distance is calculated by } , \\\\\\ ] ] where , and is for , for , and for . for the dark energy model with a constant equation of state  , the luminosity distance in a flat universe is here we adopt . figure 2 shows the joint confidence regions for  in the cdm model from the 42 grb data  obtained by utilizing the five relations calibrated with the sample at using the cubic interpolation method . the 1- confidence region is with for 40 degrees of freedom . for a flat universe , we obtain and , which is consistent with the concordance model ( , ) in the 1- confidence region . from equation ( 14 ) , it is obvious that for the cdm model , the theoretical value of the luminosity distance mainly depends on at higher redshift , and strongly depends on at lower redshift . therefore , we can find that the shape of the likelihood contour of grbs at higher redshift is almost vertical to the horizontal axis  compared to that of sne ia at lower redshift . to understand the shape of the confidence regions in the  plane , firmani et al . ( 2007 ) explored the behavior of the luminosity distance at different redshifts in a given cosmological parameter space . the stripe where varies by at , shown in the  plane , was almost vertical to the axis , which corresponds roughly to the typical redshifts  of the grb sample at . if we add the one sn ia point ( sn1997ff at ) at into our sn ia sample used to interpolate the distance moduli of grbs , we can calibrate the grb relations with 36 grbs at by using the cubic interpolation method . we find that the fitting results from the 33 grb data  obtained by utilizing the relations calibrated with the sample at using the cubic interpolation method is for a flat universe ( figure 2 ) , which is consistent with the result from the 42 grb data  obtained using the cubic interpolation method . however , if the relations are calibrated with the grb sample at by assuming a particular cosmological model , we find that the fitting results the 42 grb data  obtained assuming the cdm model or the riess cosmology are ( figure 2 ) or ( figure 2 ) for a flat universe , which are systematically higher than beyond a 1- deviation . ) in the cdm model from the data for 42 grbs  obtained by utilizing the five relations calibrated with the sample at using the cubic interpolation method . the plus sign indicates the best fit values . the contours correspond to 1 , 2 , and 3- confidence regions , and the dashed line represents the flat universe . the 1- confidence region are . for a flat universe prior , and .

( 2007 ) failed to reveal the direct evidence for sn ia evolution from analysis of the sample - averaged spectrum . it is possible that some unknown biases of sn ia luminosity relations may propagate into the interpolation results and thus the calibration results of grb relations . nevertheless , the distance moduli of sn ia are obtained directly from observations , and therefore the observable distance moduli of sne ia used in our interpolation method to calibrate the relations of grbs are completely independent of any given cosmological model . recently , there have been discussions of possible evolution effects and selection bias in grb relations . li ( 2007 ) used the amati relation as an example to test the possible cosmic evolution of grbs and found that the fitting parameters of the relation vary systematically and significantly with the mean redshift of the grbs . however , ghirlanda et al . ( 2008 ) found no sign of evolution with redshift of the amati relation and the instrumental selection effects do not dominate for grbs detected before the launch of the swift satellite . massaro et al . ( 2008 ) investigated the cosmological relation between the grb energy index and the redshift , and presented a statistical analysis of the amati relation searching for possible functional biases . tsutsui et al . ( 2008 ) reported a redshift dependence of the lag - luminosity relation in 565 baste grbs . oguri & takahashi ( 2006 ) and schaefer ( 2007 ) discussed the gravitational lensing and malmquist biases of grbs and found that the biases are small . butler et al . ( 2007 ) claimed that the best - fit of the amati relation presented in the swift sample is inconsistent with the best - fit pre- swift relation at significance . butler et al . ( 2008 ) showed that the ghirlanda relation is effectively independent of the grb redshifts . nevertheless , further examinations should be required for considering grbs as standard candles to cosmological use . because of the small grb sample used to constrain the cosmology , the present method provides no more accurate cosmological parameter constraints than the previous works where the grb and sn ia samples were used jointly . for example , wang , dai , & zhu ( 2007 ) presented constraints on the cosmological parameters by combining the 69 grb data with the other cosmological probes to get . however , our main point is not on improvement of the `` nominal statistical '' error ; rather we emphasize that our method avoids the circularity problem more clearly than previous cosmology dependent calibration methods . therefore , our results for these grb relations are less dependent on prior cosmological models . we thank hao wei , pu -

independent way . since objects at the same redshift should have the same luminosity distance and since the distance moduli of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) obtained directly from observations are completely cosmology independent , we obtain the distance modulus of a grb at a given redshift by interpolating from the hubble diagram of sne ia . then we calibrate seven grb relations without assuming a particular cosmological model and construct a grb hubble diagram to constrain cosmological parameters . from the 42 grbs at , we obtain , for the flat cdm model , and for the dark energy model with a constant equation of state , which is consistent with the concordance model in a 1- confidence region ."}
{"article": "quantum systems can be correlated in ways that supersede classical descriptions . however , there are degrees of non - classicality for quantum correlations . for simplicity , we consider only bipartite correlations , with the two , spatially separated , parties being named alice and bob as usual . at the weaker end of the spectrum are quantum systems whose states can not be expressed as a mixture of product - states of the constituents . these are called non - separable or entangled states . the product - states appearing in such a mixture comprise a local hidden state ( lhs ) model for any measurements undertaken by alice and bob . at the strongest end of the spectrum are quantum systems whose measurement correlations can violate a bell inequality , hence demonstrating ( modulo loopholes ) the violation of local causality . this phenomenon commonly known as bell - nonlocality is the only way for two spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement if either of them , or their detectors , can not be trusted . we say that a bipartite state is bell - local if and only if there is a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model for any measurements alice and bob perform . here the ` variables ' are not restricted to be quantum states , hence the distinction between non - separability and bell - nonlocality . in between these types of non - classical correlations lies epr - steering . the name is inspired by the seminal paper of einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) , and the follow - up by schrdinger , which coined the term `` steering '' for the phenomenon epr had noticed . although introduced eighty years ago , as this special issue celebrates , the notion of epr - steering was only formalized eight years ago , by one of us and co - workers . this formalization was that epr - steering is the only way to verify the existence of entanglement if one of the parties conventionally alice or her detectors , can not be trusted . we say that a bipartite state is epr - steerable if and only if it allows a demonstration of epr - steering . a state is not epr - steerable if and only if there exists a hybrid lhv lhs model explaining the alice bob correlations . since in this paper we are concerned with steering , when we refer to a lhs model we mean a lhs model for bob only ; it is implicit that alice can have a completely general lhv model . the above three notions of non - locality for quantum states coincide for pure states : any non - product pure state is non - separable , eps - steerable , and bell - nonlocal . however for mixed states , the interplay of quantum and classical correlations produces a far richer structure . for mixed states the logical hierarchy of the three concepts leads to a hierarchy for the bipartite states : the set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non - epr - steerable states , which is a strict subset of the set of bell - local states . although the epr - steerable set has been completely determined for certain classes of highly symmetric states ( at least for the case where alice and bob perform projective measurements ) , until now very little was known about what types of states are steerable even for the simplest case of two qubits . in this simplest case , the phenomenon of steering in a more general sense i.e. within what set can alice steer bob s state by measurements on her system has been studied extensively using the so - called steering ellipsoid formalism . however , no relation between the steering ellipsoid and epr - steerability has been determined . in this manuscript , we investigate epr - steerability of the class of two - qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed , the so - called t - states . we use the steering ellipsoid formalism to develop a deterministic lhs model for projective measurements on these states and we conjecture that this model is optimal . furthermore we obtain two sufficient conditions for t - states to be epr - steerable , via suitable epr - steering inequalities ( including a new asymmetric steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix ) . these sufficient conditions touch the necessary condition in some regions of the space of t - states , and everywhere else the gap between them is quite small . the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 we discuss in detail the three notions of non - locality , namely bell - nonlocality , epr - steerability and non - separability . section 3 introduces the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism for a two - qubit state , and in section 4 we use the steering ellipsoid to develop a deterministic lhs model for projective measurements on t - states . in section 5 , two asymmetric steering inequalities for arbitrary two - qubit states are derived . finally in section 6 we conclude and discuss further work . two separated observers , alice and bob , can use a shared quantum state to generate statistical correlations between local measurement outcomes . each observer carries out a local measurement , labelled by and respectively , to obtain corresponding outcomes labelled by and . the measurement correlations are described by some set of joint probability distributions , , with and ranging over the available measurements . the type of state shared by alice and bob may be classified via the properties of these joint distributions , for all possible measurement settings and . the correlations of a bell - local state have a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model , for some ` hidden ' random variable with probability distribution . hence , the measured correlations may be understood as arising from ignorance of the value of , where the latter locally determines the statistics of the outcomes and and is independent of the choice of and . conversely , a state is defined to be bell -nonlocal if it has no lhv model . such states allow , for example , the secure generation of a cryptographic key between alice and bob without trust in their devices . in this paper , we are concerned with whether the state is steerable ; that is , whether it allows for correlations that demonstrate epr - steering . as discussed in the introduction , epr - steering by alice is demonstrated if it is not the case that the correlations can be described by a hybrid lhv lhs model , wherein , where the local distributions correspond to measurements on local quantum states , i.e. , .\\ ] ] here denotes the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) corresponding to measurement . the state is said to be steerable by alice if there is no such model . the roles of alice and bob may also be reversed in the above , to define steerability by bob . comparing eqs .  and  , it is seen that all nonsteerable states are bell - local . hence , all bell - nonlocal states are steerable , by both alice and bob . in fact , the class of steerable states is strictly larger . moreover , while not as powerful as bell - nonlocality in general , steerability is more robust to detection inefficiencies , and also enables the use of untrusted devices in quantum key distribution , albeit only on one side . by a similar argument , a separable quantum state shared by alice and bob , , is both bell - local and nonsteerable . moreover , the set of separable states is strictly smaller than the set of nonsteerable states . it is important that epr - steerability of a quantum state not be confused with merely the dependence of the reduced state of one observer on the choice of measurement made by another , which can occur even for separable states . the term ` steering ' has been used with reference to this phenomenon , in particular for the concept of ` steering ellipsoid ' , which we will use in our analysis . epr - steering , as defined above , is a special case of this phenomenon , and is only possible for a subset of nonseparable states . we are interested in the epr - steerability of states for all possible projective measurements . if alice is doing the steering , then it is sufficient for bob s measurements to comprise some tomographically complete set of projectors . it is straightforward to show in this case that the condition for bob to have an lhs model , eq .  , reduces to the existence of a representation of the form = \\sum \\lambda p(\\lambda)\\ , p(1|e,\\lambda ) \\,\\rho b(\\lambda ) , \\\\ p e & = = \\sum \\lambda p(\\lambda ) p(1|e,\\lambda).\\ ] ] here is any projector that can be measured by alice ; is the probability of result ` ' and is the corresponding probability given ; is the reduced state of bob s component corresponding to this result ; and ] . it follows that if the shared state has maximally - mixed reduced states with , then it is completely described , up to local unitaries , by a diagonal , i.e. one may consider without loss of generality . such states are called t - states . they are equivalent to mixtures of bell states , and hence form a tetrahedron in the space parameterised by . entangled t - states necessarily have , and the set of separable t - states forms an octahedron within the tetrahedron . the t - state steering ellipsoid is centred at the origin , , and the ellipsoid matrix is simply , as follows from eqs .  and  with . the semiaxes are for , and are aligned with the -axes of the bloch sphere . thus , the equation of the ellipsoid surface in spherical coordinates is , with we find a remarkable connection between this equation and the epr - steerability of t - states in the following subsection . without loss of generality , consider measurement by alice of hermitian observables on her qubit . such observables can be equivalently represented via projections , , with . the probability of result ` ' and the corresponding steered bloch vector are given by eqs .  and  with , i.e. , hence , letting denote the bloch vector corresponding to in eq .  , then from eqs .  and , it follows there is an lhs model for bob if and only if there is a representation of the form for all unit vectors . noting further that can always be represented as some mixture of unit vectors , corresponding to pure , these conditions are equivalent to the existence of a representation of the form with integration over the bloch sphere . thus , the unit bloch vector labels both the local hidden state and the hidden variable . given lhs models for bob for any two t - states , having spin correlation matrices and , it is trivial to construct an lhs model for the t - state corresponding to , for any , via the convexity property of nonsteerable states . our strategy is to find deterministic lhs models for some set of t - states , for which the result ` ' is fully determined by knowledge of , i.e. , . lhs models can then be constructed for all convex combinations of t - states in this set . to find deterministic lhs models , we are guided by the fact that the steered bloch vectors are precisely those vectors that generate the surface of the quantum steering ellipsoid for the t - state . we make the ansatz that is proportional to some power of the function in eq .  that defines this surface , i.e. , ^m \\equiv n t\\,\\left^{m/2}\\ ] ] for , where is a normalisation constant . further , denoting the region of the bloch sphere , for which by ] . we note this is automatically satisfied if is a hemisphere , as a consequence of the symmetry for the above form of . hence , under the assumptions that ( i ) is determined by the steering ellipsoid as per eq .  , and ( ii ) ] . extensive numerical testing , with different values of the exponent , show that this constraint can be satisfied by the choices = \\{{\\boldsymbol}n : { \\boldsymbol}nt^{-1 } { \\boldsymbol}e\\geq 0\\},\\ ] ] for a two - parameter family of t - states . assuming the numerical results are correct , it is not difficult to show , using infinitesimal rotations of about the -axis , that this family corresponds to those t - states that satisfy fortunately , we have been able to confirm these results analytically by explicitly evaluating the integral in eq .  for ( see appendix a ) . an explicit form for the corresponding normalisation constant is also given in appendix a , and it is further shown that the family of t - states satisfying eq .  is equivalently defined by the condition this may be interpreted geometrically in terms of the harmonic mean radius of the ` inverse ' ellipsoid being equal to . equation  defines a surface in the space of possible matrices , plotted in fig . 1(a ) as a function of the semiaxes and . as a consequence of the convexity of nonsteerable states ( see above ) , all t - states corresponding to the region defined by this surface and the positive octant have local hidden state models for bob . also shown is the boundary of the separable t - states  , in red , which is clearly a strict subset of the nonsteerable t - states . the green plane corresponds to the sufficient condition for epr - steerable states , derived in sec . 5 below . it follows that a necessary condition for a t - state to be epr - steerable by alice is that it corresponds to a point above the sandwiched surface shown in fig . note that this condition is in fact symmetric between alice and bob , since their steering ellipsoids are the same for t - states . because of the elegant relation between our lhs model and the steering ellipsoid , and other evidence given below , we conjecture that this condition is also sufficient for epr - steerability . . * top figure ( a ) * : the red plane separates separable ( left ) and entangled ( right ) t -

steerable curve through the t - state subspace , showing more clearly the different correlation regions . the symmetric situation corresponds to werner states . our deterministic lhs model is for in this case , which is known to represent the epr - steerable boundary for werner states . thus , our model is certainly optimal for this class of states . in the previous section a strong necessary condition for the epr - steerability of t - states was obtained , corresponding to the boundary defined in eq .  and depicted in fig . 1 . while we have conjectured that this condition is also sufficient , it is not actually known if all t - states above this boundary are epr - steerable . here we give two sufficient general conditions for epr - steerability , and apply them to t - states . these conditions are examples of epr - steering inequalities , i.e. , statistical correlation inequalities that must be satisfied by any lhs model for bob . thus , violation of such an inequality immediately implies that alice and bob must share an epr - steerable resource . our first condition is based on a new epr - steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix , and the second on a known nonlinear epr - steering inequality . both epr - steering inequalities are further of interest in that they are asymmetric under the interchange of alice and bob s roles . suppose alice and bob share a two - qubit state with spin covariance matrix given by and that each can measure any hermitian observable on their qubit . we show in appendix that , if there is an lhs model for bob , then the singular values , , of the spin covariance matrix must satisfy the linear epr - steering inequality from , and using and for t - states , it follows immediately that one has the simple sufficient condition for the epr - steerability of t - states ( by either alice or bob ) . the boundary of t - states satisfying this condition is plotted in figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) , showing that the condition is relatively strong . in particular , it is a tangent plane to the necessary condition at the point corresponding to werner states ( which we already knew to be a point on the true boundary of epr - steerable states ) . however , in some parameter regions a stronger condition can be obtained , as per below . suppose alice and bob share a two - qubit state as before , where bob can measure the observables , on his qubit , with , for any ] , without loss of generality . making the choices and in this representation , then and are given by and the third component of in eqs .  and  , respectively , with . hence , the above inequality simplifies to ,\\ ] ] where and are the third components of alice and bob s bloch vectors and . for t - states , recalling that , the above inequality simplifies further , to the nonlinear inequality hence , since similar inequalities can be obtained by permuting , we have the sufficient condition for the epr - steerability of t - states . the boundary of t - states satisfying this condition is plotted in fig . 1(b ) for the case . it is seen to be stronger than the linear condition in eq .  if one semiaxis is sufficiently large . the region below both sufficient conditions is never far above the smooth curve of our necessary condition , supporting our conjecture that the latter is the true boundary . in this paper we have considered steering for the set of two - qubit states with maximally mixed marginals ( ` t - states ' ) , where alice is allowed to make arbitrary projective measurements on her qubit . we have constructed a lhv lhs model ( lhv for alice , lhs for bob ) , which describes measurable quantum correlations for all separable , and a large portion of non - separable , t - states . that is , this model reproduces the steering scenario , by which alice s measurement collapses bob s state to a corresponding point on the surface of the quantum steering ellipsoid . our model is constructed using the steering ellipsoid , and coincides with the optimal lhv lhs model for the case of werner states . furthermore , only a small ( and sometimes vanishing ) gap remains between the set of t - states that are provably non - steerable by our lhv lhs model , and the set that are provably steerable by the two steering inequalities that we derive . as such , we conjecture that this lhv lhs model is in fact optimal for t - states . proving this , however , remains an open question . a natural extension of this work is to consider lhv lhs models for arbitrary two - qubit states . how can knowledge of their steering ellipsoids be incorporated into such lhv lhs models ? investigations in this direction have already begun , but the situation is far more complex when alice and bob s bloch vectors have nonzero magnitude and the phenomenon of `` one - way steering '' may arise . finally , our lhv lhs models apply to the case where alice is restricted to measurements of hermitian observables . it would be of great interest to generalize these to arbitrary povm measurements . however , we note that this is a very difficult problem even for the case of two - qubit werner states . nevertheless , the steering ellipsoid is a depiction of all collapsed states , including those arising from povms ( they give the interior points of the ellipsoid ) and perhaps this can provide some intuition for how to proceed with this generalisation . sj would like to thank david jennings for his early contributions to this project . sj is funded by epsrc grant ep / k022512/1 . this work was supported by the australian research council centre of excellence ce110001027 and the european union seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 -

rank diagonal matrix and nonzero vector one has note that substitution of eq .  into constraint  immediately yields eq .  via the theorem ( with ) . further , taking the dot product of the integral in the theorem with , multiplying by , and integrating over the unit sphere , yields ( reversing the order of integration ) whereas carrying out the same operations on the righthand side of the theorem yields . equating these immediately implies the equivalence of eqs .  and  as desired . an explicit analytic formula for the normalisation constant is given at the end of this appendix . first , define ; that is , and noting in the theorem may be taken to be a unit vector without loss of generality , we will parameterise the unit vectors and by with ] and . the surface of integration is a hemisphere bounded by the great circle . in the simple case where , the boundary curve has the parametric form for . hence , the boundary curve in the generic case can be constructed by applying the orthogonal operator , that rotates from to , to the vector . that is , and the boundary curve has the form for the purposes of integrating over the hemisphere , it is convenient to vary from to and from to its value on the boundary curve . from the above expression for the boundary , and using and , it follows that and . the last equation be rearranged to read , and after squaring both sides this equation solves to give ^{1/2}}.\\]]now , assumes its maximum value when , which according to the relation and the fact that ] , where , and the hidden state has corresponding bloch vector . now , the bloch sphere can be partitioned into two sets , v \\geq 0\\} ] , for each value of . hence , noting , is equal to \\,v \\right.\\\\ & ~ & \\left . + \\int {s -(\\lambda ) } { \\!}^2{\\boldsymbol}v\\ , \\,v \\right\\}\\ ] ] \\,v \\right.\\\\ & ~ & -\\left . \\int {s -(\\lambda ) } { \\!}^2{\\boldsymbol}v\\ , \\,v \\right\\}\\\\ & = & \\sum \\lambda p(\\lambda ) \\int { \\!}^2{\\boldsymbol}v\\ , |v|\\ ] ] v\\\\ & = & \\sum \\lambda p(\\lambda ) |{\\boldsymbol}n(\\lambda)-{\\boldsymbol}b|\\,\\int { \\!}^2{\\boldsymbol}v\\ , |{\\boldsymbol}v\\cdot { \\boldsymbol}w(\\lambda)|,\\ ] ] where denotes the unit vector in the direction , and the last line follows by interchanging the summation and integration in the second term of the previous line . the integral in the last line can be evaluated for each value of by rotating the coordinates such that is aligned with the -axis , yielding . hence , the above inequality can be rewritten as ^{1/2 } \\\\ & \\leq & {2}bb},\\ ] ] where the second and third lines follow using the schwarz inequality and , respectively . note , by the way , that the first inequality is tight for the case v\\right)$ ] . now , making the choice with , one has from eqs .  and  that combining with eq .  immediately yields the epr -

{"article": "almost forty years ago exotic , apparently hybrid and unexpected events , dubbed centauros , were observed in cosmic ray ( cr ) experiments in emulsion chambers in chacaltaya by lattes and collaborators . those events were very different from what is commonly observed in crs , exhibiting a large number of hadrons and a small number of electrons and gammas , which suggests the presence of very few rapid - gamma - decaying hadrons . so , a possible imbalance in the number of neutral to charged pions could be envisaged . the nature and reality of centauro events started a long debate , that includes the reexamination of the original emulsion chamber plates , and is still not resolved . nevertheless , centauro events were certainly an experimental motivation for the development of the theory of disoriented chiral condensates ( dccs ) that started in the early 1990s . for a detailed review , see ref . . assuming that a given nuclear system could be heated above the critical ( crossover ) transition region for chiral symmetry restoration , i.e. for temperatures of the order of mev , then quenched to low temperatures , the chiral condensate initially melted to zero could grow in any direction in isospin space . besides the vacuum ( stable ) direction , it could build up as in a metastable , misaligned pseudo - vacuum state , and later decay to the true , chirally broken vacuum . the fact that dccs could be formed in high - energy heavy ion collisions stimulated several theoretical advances and experimental searches . most likely the temperatures achieved in current heavy ion experiments are high enough to produce an approximately chirally symmetric quark - gluon plasma , and the following rapid expansion can cool the system back to the vacuum , so that the dynamics of chiral symmetry restoration and breakdown can be described in a quench scenario , so that the evolution of the order parameter can be much affected by an explosive behavior that naturally leads to large fluctuations and inhomogeneities . since , by assumption , the order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking , i.e. the chiral condensate , is misaligned with respect to the vacuum direction ( associated with the -direction in effective models for strong interactions ) in a dcc , this would be a natural candidate to explain the excessive production of hadrons unaccompanied by electrons and photons , suggesting the suppression of neutral pions with respect to charged pions . regardless of the outcome of the debate on the nature of centauro events , dcc formation seems to be a quite natural phenomenon in the theory of strong interactions . however , given its symmetric nature ( in isospin space ) , it should be washed out by standard event averaging methods . so far , there has been no evidence from colliders or cr experiments . motivated by the possibility of attaining much higher statistics in current ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) experiments than in the past , so that an event - by - event analysis for very high - energy collisions can in principle be performed , we consider possible signatures of dcc production in cr air showers . if dccs are formed in high - energy nuclear collisions in the atmosphere , the relevant outcome from the primary collision are very large event - by - event fluctuations in the neutral - to - charged pion fraction , and this could affect the nature of the subsequent atmospheric shower . very preliminary , yet encouraging results were presented in ref . . in this paper we search for fingerprints of dcc formation in two different observables of uhecr showers . we present simulation results for the depth of the maximum  and number of muons on the ground , evaluating their sensitivity to the neutral - to - charged pion fraction asymmetry produced in the primary interaction . to model the effect from the presence of a dcc , we simply modify the neutral - to - charged pion fraction , assuming that the system follows the same kinematics , as will be detailed below . although this is certainly a very crude description of the dynamics of the primary collision , we believe it captures the essential features that have to be tested in order to verify the feasibility of detecting dccs in uhecr showers . this paper is organized as follows . in section ii we briefly review some characteristics of dccs , especially the baked - alaska scenario and the inverse square root distribution of the neutral pion fraction . in section iii the method for the simulation is presented . we use corsika , a program for detailed simulation of extensive air showers initiated by high - energy cosmic ray particles . in section iv we show and discuss our results . section v contains our conclusions . it is widely believed that for high enough energy densities , achieved e.g. by increasing dramatically the temperature , strong interactions becomes approximately chiral ( it would be an exact symmetry only if current quarks were strictly massless ) , so that the chiral condensate , which is the order parameter for that transition , essentially vanishes . on the other hand , for low temperatures the chiral condensate acquires a non - vanishing value and breaks spontaneously the chiral symmetry of ( massless ) qcd . in a given model , one can construct an effective potential for the chiral condensate degrees of freedom and study the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration and breakdown . if we restrict our analysis to two flavors of light quarks , up and down , that can be easily accomplished by the linear sigma model coupled to quarks . in that case , the effective degrees of freedom are pions , , and the sigma , . in the high - temperature limit all field expectation values vanish , whereas in the vacuum one has and , where is the pion decay constant . the physical picture we have in mind is a very high - energy heavy ion collision that will create a hot quark - gluon plasma where chiral symmetry is approximately restored . as the plasma is quenched to low temperatures by expansion , the system will evolve to the vacuum emitting a large number of pions . however , the evolution can proceed along many different paths in chiral space before it finally reaches the true vacuum , i.e. it can `` roll '' into different directions , and the ratio of neutral to charged pions produced depends strongly on the chosen metastable state in each event . in other words , the misalignment of the vacuum is reflected in the distribution of produced pions , generating a coherent state and an anomaly in the ratio of charged to neutral pions . this effect will be , of course , washed out by event averages . a more intuitive physical picture for the formation of dccs , the baked - alaska scenario , was proposed by bjorken and collaborators . consider a high - multiplicity collision at high energy . before hadronization , most of the energy released at the collision point is carried away by the primary partons at nearly the speed of light . this hot and thin expanding shell isolates the relatively cold interior from the outer vacuum . as the state evolves , the interior cools down and what was before a global minimum becomes a local maximum . the symmetry is spontaneously broken and one of the pseudo - vacua should be chosen , with a slight preference for the true vacuum . however , if the lifetime of the shell is short enough , the quark condensate in the interior might be rotated from its ordinary direction , since it costs relatively little energy , mev/ . when the hot shell hadronizes , the reorientation induced by the external contact is reflected in the produced pions , which will be coherent and present fluctuations in an event - by - event analysis . assuming that the correlated region is large enough to be described semiclassically , one can use the linear sigma model with explicit symmetry breaking for the description of the dynamics . quantitatively , one can represent the shell of this fireball as the source of these excitations of pions : where is the isospin index . a spherically expanding shell is represented by with initial radius , where is the time where the expansion starts . after the hadronization , the currents vanish and the fields decay towards the vacuum into freely propagating pions . so , the pion emission is characterized by the state where is a normalization factor , and the sum is over isospin directions . the creation operator of a pion with momentum and isospin component is and is the 4-dimensional fourier transform of the source at . the number of pions follows a poisson distribution with average and the number of pions produced per unit phase space is approximately given by statistically , one expects that the magnitude and the chiral orientation of the source will fluctuate event by event for each mode . let us assume that the vacuum orientation is tilted into one of the pion directions , i.e. : so that all relevant modes of chiral condensate point in the same direction in isospin space : in generic models of production the neutral pion fraction , defined as is a binomial distribution with average . in this way , in the limit of large numbers , the probability of all pions being charged is very small . however , if pions are the product of a dcc decay , this probability is not negligible . in fact , if there is no privileged isospin direction , the vector can point in any direction within the unit sphere . then : where is the angle between the unit vector and the direction . so , one finds the following well - known distribution for the neutral pion fraction : the probability of less than 10 of pions be neutral , for instance , is . the conditions of a high temperature initial state followed by a rapid cooling stage are both possible to happen in heavy ion collisions at the very high energies like those accessible at rhic and to be reached at the lhc , as well as in uhecr collisions in the top of the atmosphere . the large aperture of a detector like that of the pierre auger observatory ( combining shower sampling at ground level and longitudinal shower profile reconstruction ) has been providing high quality data and unprecedented statistics in the field . therefore , even though the formation of a dcc is probably rare , we believe it is worth studying the implications of such events to the physics of showers generated by uhecr . the neutral pion fraction distribution , eq .  , is at the basis of our strategy to search for dcc fingerprints in uhecr showers . therefore , any investigation to measure the impact caused by the presence of a dcc should assess the sensitivity of a given observable with respect to the neutral pion fraction produced in the primary interaction . this fraction determines the initial distribution of particles between the electromagnetic and hadronic components of the showers . in this paper , we consider two observables which are usually measured by uhecr detectors : the slant depth in the atmosphere ( defined as the integral of the atmosphere density along the shower axis and expressed in units of g/ ) at which the shower reaches its maximum development , , and the number of muons on the ground . it is known that the parameter is affected by the first interaction cross - section and its associated multiplicity and inelasticity . if dccs really exist , the conditions for them to be produced should include not only high energy densities , but the regions where such densities are achieved should not be small as well , since dccs are considered `` macroscopic '' space - time regions where the chiral parameter is not oriented in the same direction as the vacuum . with those requirements in mind , we have chosen to work with fe initiated showers at ev . then , central collisions are privileged over peripheral ones by selecting events with a large number of participating nucleons  which , in turn , should lead to a higher multiplicity in the first interaction . for all simulations presented in this work , we have used corsika 6.617 with the interaction models sibyll 2.1 and gheisha 2002d , for high and low energy processes , respectively . the dcc - like shower simulation chain is as follows : large collisions are selected and their first secondaries ( mostly pions and kaons ) separated ; after , some of the neutral pions in this sample are converted into charged ones ; the resulting particle list is then inserted back into corsika to proceed with usual cascade development through the atmosphere . such a procedure was performed for several fractions and 2 different zenith angles . the first interaction slant depth  distribution for dcc - like showers will therefore be the same as for normal fe initiated showers in central collisions . this is a valid assumption , since the dcc formation process takes place during a subsequent cooling stage of the initial hot plasma , with the first interaction cross section being the same as in a fe - nucleus collision . we believe that even though the simulation approach adopted here is simplified , the essential features of the process are being taken into account . for comparison , proton initiated showers as well as normal fe initiated ones were also generated . for the normal fe case , we have produced both a sample rich in central collisions and another sample with all the centralities . for each shower we extract the value of and the number of muons on the ground . from now on we shall identify our dcc - like fe initiated showers by fe+dcc . shows the distribution of a vertical shower  corresponding to an extremely asymmetric situation  , that is , where all the initially produced s are converted into . for the distribution of eq .  , sharply peaked at , the probability for less than 1% of s being produced is 10% . four types of showers : normal fe ( central collision : fe - central ) , fe ( all centralities ) , fe+dcc and proton initiated are shown . on can clearly see that both samples generated from a central collision have smaller than average , since the higher the multiplicity in the first interaction the faster is the subsequent cascade development in the atmosphere . and there is essencially no difference between the fe - central and the fe - dcc samples in terms of , which might indicate that the early stage where the population is depleted together with the higher interaction probability due to the large multiplicity allow for a complete recovery of these particles in the subsequent interactions . nonetheless , it is clear that one should look at low events when searching for dccs signatures , and this property is independent of the initial fraction . another feature which can be appreciated in fig . is the smaller fluctuations for fe - dcc and fe - central as compared to those of proton and fe with all centralites . this is to be expected , since the fluctuations in have basically two components : the the ones in the first interaction slant depth ( which , in turn , depends on the interaction cross - section ) and those introduced by the cascade growth up to the maximum . the latter depends on the initial shower size ( the multiplicity ) , in average being smaller for high multiplicity events , i.e. those found in the central collisions . the muon number distributions on the ground for the same showers described above are shown in fig . . as expected , increasing the number of initial charged pions will lead to a corresponding larger density of muons on the ground as the products of the charged pions decay . as one combines both pieces of information ( and ) , one finds a good separation between the fe - dcc sample and all the other populations , as can be seen from fig . . when collisions with all the centralities are allowed , iron showers exhibit a positive correlation between and . the correlation is such that showers reaching maximum development at increasingly larger slant depths produce , in turn , a higher muon density at ground level , due to the decrease in the attenuation in the atmosphere from to the ground . whereas for fe - central showers one sees no correlation between and , for the case of fe - dcc showers , instead , a small anti - correlation of about g// muons is present distribution provides g//muon . ] , as can be seen from fig . . such an inverted correlation can be understood remembering the additional correlation between and the multiplicity in the first interaction , with low events corresponding , in average , to high multiplicity . as we convert neutral pions to charged ones , high multiplicity ( small ) events show a larger muon density on the ground as compared to low multiplicity ones ( large ) . since the number of muons on the ground depend both on the fraction and on the zenith angle , due to atmospheric attenuation , we decided to perform a more systematic study by varying those parameters . applying a linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) , similar to what has been done in we have determined , as a function of , a power of discrimination defined as , with the classification error , in the 2 populations case ( and ) given by : where  are the number of events from population  misclassified as  and  is total number of events in population  . as training samples we have used half of the simulated showers , with the other half being used for the determination of the power of discrimination . ( top , middle and bottom left ) shows again the two - dimensional scatter plots in the plane for the same 4 populations analyzed above and 5 values of fraction and degrees . the merit factor as a function of is shown at the bottom right plot of fig . . one sees that for any value of , proton showers can always be reasonably separated from fe - dcc , with merit factors above 97% in the whole interval of . for fe showers , of course , as we approach the fraction , the separation power gets weaker . fe - central showers are easier to separate from the fe ( all centralities ) signals only at small values of , where the excess of muons at ground is large enough to segregate the fe - dcc population . fe - dccs showers in which the first interaction produces a large amount of are very poor in muons and would also be easily recognized . however , even if dccs exist in nature , such large- events are very unlikely to happen taken into account the distribution of eq .  . a more robust estimation of the power of discrimination would have to incorporate a priori information on the population frequencies for proton and fe , as well as the dcc occurrence frequency . nonetheless , since neither the cosmic rays chemical composition at the highest energies ( ev ) nor the full dynamics of dcc formation are known , flat priors on these variables are the best one can do so far . the recent increase in quality and statistics of uhecr data brings the possibility to look for exotic phenomena as well as rare phenomena within the standard model . among the latter , dccs have been predicted about twenty years ago , yet never detected due to their elusive character . in this paper , using air shower simulations , we searched for fingerprints of dccs formed in ultra - high - energy ( ev ) central iron collisions in the upper atmosphere . in particular , we studied the influence of the dcc formation on the observables and , via the asymmetry in the neutral - to - charged pion ratio in the primary collision . for comparison , we considered also regular air showers generated by protons and iron . since dccs are expected to be formed in central collisions , which lead to smaller than average values of ( a difference of about g/ as compared to iron , for instance ) , one should concentrate searches within this region of shower depth . for the same reason , if dcc events are present they should yield small fluctuations in . however , based only on the behavior of this observable one can not distinguish between an iron shower and a central collision and one produced in the presence of a dcc . the formation of dccs is associated with large event - by - event fluctuations in the ratio of neutral to charged pions , . in particular , for large or small as compared to , one should expect a sizable change in the muon density on the ground , especially for vertical showers . this fact was noticed in the preliminary study of ref . . in the extreme case of , where dcc events lead to muon - rich showers , we showed that this signature distinguishes between the cases of iron ( even for central collisions ) and a dcc event . for large , one can also separate these two cases due to the large depletion of muons on the ground . even in this case , the signature is not contaminated by proton events . for vertical showers , there is a clear anti - correlation between and . this comes about since there is a correlation between and the first interaction multiplicity , as was discussed in the previous section . this behavior is not expected in a regular iron shower . in fact , for iron , due to atmospheric attenuation , one would expect a positive correlation . even though the analysis presented here is very simplified , it has the advantage of providing a setup that is totally under control for simulations , and we believe it contains the essential ingredients of the phenomena considered . nevertheless , a more realistic study , that should contain a description of the dynamics of dcc formation , especially its dependence on energy , is certainly necessary . we thank f. catalani and j. takahashi for useful discussions . we also thank v. de souza for computer time at the usp - so carlos cluster . this work was partially supported by by capes , cnpq , faperj , fapesp and fujb / ufrj . c. m. g. lattes et al . , prog . suppl . * 47 * , 1 ( 1971 ) ;

{"article": "several decades ago , postulated that the absorption lines observed in the spectra of distant qsos are due to the extended gaseous halos of intervening galaxies . since that time , astronomers have identified the galaxies associated with the observed absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and have used qso spectroscopy of various rest - frame ultraviolet transitions to constrain the nature of baryonic processes in the outer regions of galaxies , e.g. , feedback , accretion , and cooling . these transitions include ly and lines that probe cooler , photoionized gas , and and doublets that trace warmer , more diffuse material . however , while the apparent brightness of qsos enables high signal - to - noise , high spectral resolution datasets , they severely outshine the galaxies projected nearby and therefore limit follow - up analysis , especially at small impact parameters . furthermore , qsos are too rare in the sky to probe numerous individual galaxies with multiple sightlines . therefore , constraints on the covering fraction  and spatial distribution of halo gas must be statistical ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? the doublet in particular has been studied extensively , as it is easily accessible at optical wavelengths at redshifts and traces cool gas ( with temperature ; * ? ? ? * ) in a broad range of neutral hydrogen column densities ( ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in spite of this , the physical origins of the gas giving rise to absorption remain obscure several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) suggest an infall origin for this gas ; for example , present an infall model with which they reproduce the observed frequency distribution function for systems as well as their clustering properties . other studies suggest instead that these systems arise in gas which has been blown out of star - forming galaxies via superwinds . in support of this latter scenario , a recent study by of kinematics in coadded deep2 spectra of a sample of star - forming galaxies at reveals frequent , perhaps even ubiquitous , outflows of cool gas . also detect very high velocity outflows in post - starburst galaxies traced by absorption . such winds may redistribute absorbing gas , possibly to a galaxy s halo , although the distances to which the winds extend remain uncertain . in one of the only studies addressing this issue , observes cool outflowing gas several kiloparsecs from the nuclei of a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies . in principle , galaxy spectra can also probe the halo gas of foreground galaxies along the sightline ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? this novel technique offers several advantages over qso - galaxy pair studies ( d. koo et al . 2009 , in preparation ) . the projected number density of galaxies on the sky is much greater than that of qsos ; therefore the use of galaxies can vastly increase the number of potential background probes for a given galaxy halo . moreover , many galaxies are extended sources which provide the opportunity to study gas along multiple lines of sight through a given foreground halo , including their own ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrographs may then be used to study the morphology of halo absorption and the spatial distribution of outflowing gas . close transverse pairs of galaxies may be identified in large spectroscopic or photometric surveys so that a targeted search for foreground absorption in the background galaxy spectra can be performed . this technique has been used at to study absorbing gas traced by transitions such as near lyman break galaxies by ; but it has not yet been used at lower redshifts where higher resolution imaging and spectroscopy can be obtained for each galaxy . in the process of carrying out a spectroscopic survey to measure outflow properties in galaxies at , we identified a close transverse pair of galaxies in which the spectroscopy of the more distant object  allows the detection ( in absorption ) of gas in the environs of a foreground galaxy ( at and at impact parameter kpc ) . this foreground absorber shows signs of recent merger activity , has a stellar continuum consistent with that of a post - starburst galaxy , and is host to a low - luminosity agn . here we analyze the spectrum of the background galaxy to examine halo gas in the foreground system . we discuss our observations of the galaxy pair and data reduction in . analysis of the luminous components of the galaxies and the foreground halo absorption is given in . the possible origins of the observed cool halo gas are discussed in , and we conclude in . we adopt a cosmology with , , and . where it is not explicitly written , we assume . magnitudes quoted are in the ab system . our targeted galaxy pair is located in the goods - n field ( great observatories origins survey ; * ? ? ? * ) and has been imaged by the hst advanced camera for surveys in 4 optical bands ( f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp , or , , and ) . galaxy properties derived in previous studies and references are given in table . we obtained spectroscopy of both galaxies using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) on keck 1 on 2008 may 30 - 31 ut . we used the grism blazed at 4000 on the blue side and the grating blazed at 7500 on the red side with the d560 dichroic . this setup affords a fwhm resolution ranging between and and wavelength coverage between and . two sets of spectra were obtained . we first used a slitmask to place a slitlet across the center of the background galaxy oriented ne and collected exposures with fwhm seeing . we also placed a -wide longslit across both galaxies and obtained exposures with seeing ( see figure ) . the data were reduced using the xidl lowreduxxavier / lowredux/ ] data reduction pipeline . the pipeline includes bias subtraction and flat - fielding , slit finding , wavelength calibration , object identification , sky subtraction , cosmic ray rejection , and flux calibration . vacuum and heliocentric corrections were applied . because the separation between the galaxies is only 2.8 , we used a spatially narrow gaussian centered on the foreground object to weight the extracted spectrum ( with and for the blue and red sides , respectively ) . this limits contamination of the foreground spectrum by emission from the background object to . using a wider extraction window  does slightly change the equivalent widths ( ews ) of absorption lines ( e.g. , h9 , ) measured for the foreground galaxy , but it does not affect the results of our stellar population modeling ( discussed in ) . we derive redshifts for the two galaxies using idl code adapted for use in the deep2 survey ( s. faber et al . 2009 , in preparation ; * ? ? ? * ) from the publicly available programs developed for the sdss . ] in brief , this code calculates the minimum value as a function of the lag between an observed spectrum and a linear combination of three templates . one template is an artificial emission line spectrum with lines broadened for consistency with an instrumental resolution of , one is the coadded spectrum of thousands of absorption - line dominated galaxies , and one is an a star spectrum . the spectral region which includes interstellar uv absorption lines was not used to constrain the fits . each galaxy redshift has also been confirmed by eye . we find that the redshifts of the background and foreground galaxies are and , respectively . the errors are the formal uncertainties in the fitted values . these redshifts are within of the redshifts obtained in the team keck treasury redshift survey ( tkrs ; * ? ? ? * ) for these objects . we define the systemic velocity of each galaxy to be at the corresponding fitted redshift . figures and show hst imaging of the galaxy pair and our lris spectrum of the background galaxy , respectively . uv absorption lines in the rest - frame of the background object are marked in red and are offset to negative velocity from systemic , indicating the presence of an outflow . emission due to , as well as emission near the absorption lines , is also evident . the same lines in absorption are marked at the systemic velocity of the foreground galaxy in blue ; these marks coincide with strong absorption in the spectrum , and are presumably due to gas associated with the foreground galaxy . we measured ews of absorption and emission features after normalizing the spectra to the continuum level . this level was determined via a linear fit to the continuum around each feature of interest . we selected different continuum regions for each transition with widths between 8 and 72 . we used a feature - finding code described in to identify and measure the boxcar ew in both emission and absorption lines with ( table ) . the foreground galaxy halo / disk absorption has rest equivalent width and is classified as an ultrastrong \" absorber . values this large are rare in surveys of absorption in qso sightlines ; e.g. , absorbers with make up only 3% of the population of all absorbers with . although the number of known galaxy - qso absorber pairs with impact parameters less than is quite small , only two of these have . ( we are not including the galaxy - absorber pairs from the sample of here , as they lack spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts of the associated galaxies . ) this system also exhibits and is classified as a strong \"  absorber . the of this halo / disk gas is among the largest measured for the absorbers in the study . we find no evidence of emission ( e.g. , ) due to another galaxy at the redshift of the foreground absorber in either the slitmask or the longslit spectrum . furthermore , the other objects identified in the hst image are significantly fainter and lie at larger impact parameters than the previously identified foreground galaxy . we conclude that the foreground absorption is associated with this galaxy located at from the center of the background galaxy , where the center is determined from quantitative morphological analysis of the -band image by j. lotz ( 2008 , private communication ) , using the method described in . the background galaxy is one of the brightest galaxies in the -band in the tkrs at its redshift and is among the bluest objects in the blue cloud \" in the galaxy color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , as shown in the left panel of figure . we derive a star formation rate ( sfr ) of using the luminosity of the h line measured in and assuming a dust attenuation curve with effective v - band optical depth as derived from the stellar population modeling discussed below . we assume case b recombination to calculate an h luminosity and apply the calibration of to convert this to sfr . measure an oxygen abundance of , close to the solar abundance value of 8.72 . our lris spectrum reveals a weak emission line , which indicates the object is host to an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? agn activity may therefore affect the sfr estimate and the estimate of the oxygen abundance . because the emission is weak , a gaussian fit to the line profile results in a rest - frame dispersion of ; this value is within of the instrumental velocity dispersion at this wavelength . ( all other velocity dispersions reported are calculated by performing a nonlinear least - squares fit of a gaussian to the appropriate emission line and its surrounding continuum and subtracting the instrumental velocity dispersion from the fitted gaussian in quadrature . continuum regions were chosen to extend at least 7 from line center . ) we also observe strong emission that results in a p - cygni line - profile ( figure ) , as well as a series of emission features near the resonance lines which we identify as fine - structure transitions from excited states of . to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of narrow fine - structure emission from any extragalactic object . these emission features may be related to agn activity , but perhaps could be attributed to some other physical mechanism . their origin will be discussed in a future work . to estimate the contribution of the agn to the continuum emission , we used stellar population synthesis models to generate a grid of synthetic starburst galaxy spectra . all models include an old stellar population , specifically a 7 gyr - old single - burst stellar population ( ssp7 ) with solar metallicity , and the stellar population of an 100 myr - old ongoing burst with constant star formation rate . these particular choices of old and bursting stellar populations are motivated by , who use them to identify post - starburst galaxies via stellar population modeling . to each of these spectra , we add a featureless power - law continuum with a variable normalization to model the agn contribution to the galaxy continuum . we also allow for a variable amount of dust attenuation , parametrized by . ( details of the fitting are discussed in and k. rubin et al . 2009 , in preparation . ) the spectrum is fit well by models with a range in that combine a strong starburst with a power - law component that contributes less than 30% of the emission at 4200 in the rest frame . we conclude that the continuum emission is consistent with a galaxy spectrum that is dominated by intense star formation , rather than agn activity . because of its high surface brightness and strong continuum blueward of observed wavelength , this galaxy is an excellent and rare candidate for probing gas in foreground halos . at the same time , its spectrum may be used to probe cool gas ( via low - ionization absorption ) associated with its own ism and halo but foreground to its bright star - forming regions . as noted previously ( see ) , the spectrum of tkrs4389 exhibits evidence for a substantial outflow of cool gas . a quantitative analysis of the outflow properties ( e.g. , velocity , , limits on the outflow column density , and mass outflow rate ) of a large sample of galaxies including this one will be undertaken by k. rubin et al . ( 2009 , in preparation ) . vs. for tkrs galaxies with ( left - hand panel ) and ( right - hand panel ) . background ( tkrs4389 ) and foreground ( tkrs4259 ) galaxies are marked with a large circle and square , respectively . the solid line divides the red sequence \" from the blue cloud \" as given in . the foreground galaxy lies in the so - called green valley \" and may evolve to the bright end of the red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? ,width=172 ] and ; red ) . the smoothed error values in the data are shown with the dotted line . emission lines and the central regions of balmer absorption lines in the galaxy spectrum were masked out prior to fitting ( masked regions are shown in green ) , as the model spectra do not include line emission from agn or regions . bad pixels are also masked out . models with 600myr 1.4gyr successfully reproduce the strong balmer , k and g band absorption in the data . ] kpc . the systemic velocity is marked with vertical dotted lines . the dashed line marks the continuum level . the rest ew of absorption due to the foreground halo is . we note that these absorption profiles are asymmetric about the deepest part of each line . the lines are heavily saturated ( see ) and have depths of % of the continuum level . this is indicative of a for absorbing clouds of . ] the proximity of this galaxy pair allows us to analyze the halo properties of the foreground galaxy at an impact parameter of kpc . to understand these properties in context , we first present an analysis of the luminous components of the foreground galaxy . tkrs4259 is a massive ( , where is the stellar mass ; ) , relatively luminous galaxy , located in the green valley \" between the red sequence and the blue cloud in the vs. cmd ( figure ; * ? ? ? although a gini / m20 analysis ( j. lotz , 2008 , private communication ) indicates tkrs4259 is an early - type galaxy , it shows signs of a disturbed morphology or dust lane in all of the hst / acs bands ( i.e. , a low surface brightness tidal feature ; figure ) . both its location in the cmd and its morphology indicate the galaxy may be transitioning from a previously star - forming galaxy to a fully quenched object . tkrs galaxies of similar and redshift have approximately solar oxygen abundance or greater . the , , and emission - line luminosities for this galaxy were measured by and are included in table . we also detect narrow emission with rest - frame velocity dispersion ( see table ) , indicating this galaxy hosts an agn . before calculating a sfr based on the or luminosities , we investigate the possible agn contribution to this lower ionization line emission . the line luminosity ratio ; the galaxy falls just below the ratio dividing liners ( at lower values ) and seyferts ( at higher values ) in the system of spectral classification described in , e.g. , , and . unfortunately , we do not have spectral coverage of and and can not strictly classify this galaxy as a liner . however , because /h is correlated with metallicity in star - forming galaxies , and because there is a tight relation between mass and metallicity in these objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , we may use as a proxy for /h . this is demonstrated in figure 2 of , which shows a correlation between absolute -band magnitude and both /h and /h in blue cloud galaxies . our foreground galaxy lies far from the locus of star - forming galaxies in /h - space , with a times higher than in galaxies with similar /h ratios in the tkrs . it also satisfies the agn criterion of r. yan et al . ( 2009 , in preparation ) , who find that color can serve as a proxy for /h as well . we conclude that liner or agn activity dominates the observed line emission . in addition , measure an x - ray luminosity of for this object . this luminosity is low enough to be produced by star formation ; however , based on our analysis of the optical spectrum , we attribute the x - ray emission to weak agn activity . we can not , however , rule out ongoing star formation based on this analysis alone . the upper limit on the sfr assuming all emission is due to star formation ( and assuming the largest from the range derived from stellar population modeling , , as discussed below ) , is . we measure a velocity dispersion of for this line , and note that a line of this width may arise from an agn , as narrow emission from agn has been shown to have approximately the same velocity dispersion as the bulges of the agn host galaxies . in order to further constrain the rates of current and recent star formation , we generate synthetic starburst spectra as described in . as above , all models include a 7.0 gyr - old single - burst stellar population ( ssp7 ) of mass with solar metallicity  and an 100 myr - old burst with constant sfr which generates a mass in stars . we generate a similar set of models with supersolar metallicity  . the strength of the burst is parametrized by , where ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . we create models with and compare them to the lris spectrum of the foreground galaxy at 5620 7550 ( see figure ) . we do not fit the portion of the spectrum blueward of this range , as it falls on the opposite side of the d560 dichroic , and because it lacks spectral features useful for distinguishing star formation histories . the portion redward of this range is quite noisy and is subject to atmospheric absorption . for each model , we find the best - fit value of , with an attenuation curve parametrized in , by performing a minimization . the models do not include nebular or agn line emission , so emission lines in the data are masked out prior to fitting . we find that both solar and super - solar metallicity model spectra can not simultaneously match the strengths of the balmer absorption and the k and g band absorption in the data . the addition of a featureless power - law ( qso ) component ( with ; * ? ? ? * ) does not improve the fits significantly . these results suggest that there is no ongoing star formation in this galaxy . a strictly passively evolving model is ruled out by the spectrum as well . we also wish to investigate alternative star formation histories . one possible star formation history that suggests itself , based on the location of the galaxy in the cmd as well as its morphology , is one in which the galaxy evolved passively for several billion years and then experienced a burst of star formation , which has since ceased . we again generate a suite of solar metallicity models , all with a ssp which formed 7 gyr ago . a burst with constant sfr lasting 100 myr is added to each model at a time , where varies between 1.8 gyr ago and 200 myr ago . as described below , this span in burst age encompasses the range in ages for models which provide a good fit to the data . models have values . we allow for the addition of a qso power - law continuum component as described above . we find the best - fit values of and the fraction of light contributed by the power - law component by minimizing for each model in our grid . we perform a visual inspection of the fit of each model , and find that models with intermediate values and larger values of are most successful at fitting the deep balmer absorption and k and g band absorption strengths in the data . the best - fit model has a high value of ( ; larger values give similar results ) and a 1 gyr - old burst ; this model is shown in figure . the best - fit value of , and the fraction of the total light contributed by the power - law component at 4200 in the rest - frame is . models with , with and , or with can not simultaneously match the balmer , k and g band absorption strengths and thus yield unacceptable fits . models with yield acceptable fits if is large enough at older ages , with a range in fitted values between 0 and 1.8 . we conclude that a starburst occurred in the galaxy between 1.4gyr and 600myr ago . the results are similar for models . + in summary , we find that the foreground galaxy is host to a low luminosity agn and has a stellar continuum consistent with that of a post - starburst galaxy . it has an asymmetric morphology and is located in the green valley \" in the cmd . we note that the morphology of this object in the band is in general consistent with that of simulated merger remnants after the final coalescence . these results can be explained by a scenario in which the galaxy recently experienced a merger which triggered a starburst . the starburst then ceased , perhaps because the cool gas supply was exhausted or expelled . in this case , the galaxy will migrate to the red sequence . + analyzing our spectrum of the background galaxy ( tkrs4389 ) which lies at an impact parameter of , we identify strong , , and absorption from gas associated with the foreground galaxy . a subset of these features is shown in figure with velocities relative to the systemic velocity of tkrs4259 . the spectrum shown was obtained with the slitlet marked with the solid lines in figure ; however , the spectrum taken with the longslit ( marked with dashed lines in figure ) exhibits foreground absorption line profiles with similar depths and shapes as those shown . the measured ew is extreme : . the oscillator strengths of the lines in the doublet have a ratio 2:1 , and as the optical depth of the lines increases and they saturate , the ew ratio of the doublet decreases from 2:1 to 1:1 . the ew ratio of the lines in our system is , indicating a high degree of saturation . in the case of heavily saturated lines , the value is indicative of extreme kinematics , i.e. , a large velocity width of . at such a low impact parameter , it is possible that our line of sight is probing gas in the outer disk of the galaxy . however , even if the galaxy were edge - on ( it is not ) , the predicted differential rotation of a disk at this impact parameter would be of the order a few tens of . we conclude that the gas dynamics are dominated by non - rotational motions and that the majority of gas is extraplanar , i.e. , tracing material in the halo of tkrs4259 . because the lines are strongly saturated , the depth of the lines depends only on the fraction of the background light source that is covered by absorbing gas  and the instrument resolution . the deepest parts of the line profiles from the spectra taken with slits at both orientations reach % of the continuum level , which places a lower limit . the relatively low spectral resolution smears the profiles , and the deepest parts of the lines may in fact appear at much lower normalized flux levels when observed at higher resolution . this constraint on is particularly striking given the large beam size provided by the background galaxy : the distance between the two brightest knots in this galaxy is kpc at . this may suggest that the absorbing gas complex almost completely covers the background source and has a large velocity dispersion at all the locations probed . this is consistent with previous results from , who report velocity coherence in absorbing clouds on kpc scales . we leave detailed modeling of the effect of such a large beam size on the observed absorption to a future work ( although see for an analysis of the effects of grb vs. qso beam size on absorption system studies ) . here we examine several possible scenarios for the origin of the gas in the foreground galaxy halo . in the galaxy formation scenario proposed by and , clouds condense out of the hot gas in galaxy halos as it cools . the velocity dispersion of these clouds is approximately that of the galaxy halo ; we may therefore estimate the expected velocity dispersion in -absorbing clouds given a halo mass for the galaxy . using the relation between halo mass and stellar mass derived in via the abundance matching \" technique , we estimate that the halo mass  of the foreground galaxy is for . using the relations between and halo virial velocity given in and assuming a singular isothermal sphere for the halo density profile , we find that the expected fwhm of the line - of - sight velocity distribution for cool clouds in a halo this massive is . this dispersion could easily produce a , consistent with the measured for this galaxy . the thermal stability analysis of the hot gas surrounding galaxies performed by suggests that in the case of an isolated halo more massive than that of the milky way ( ; * ? ? ? * ) , a smoothly stratified hot gaseous corona is stable to thermal perturbations and thus will not condense into cool clouds . however , this study does not account for the effects of gas inflow from the igm ; nor does the assumption of a smooth hot gaseous halo likely apply in this case , given that our host galaxy is a merger remnant . the three - dimensional cosmological simulations of show that even in halos well above the transition \" mass  , in which hot , virialized atmospheres develop via shock - heating during gas accretion , cold filaments of gas from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can penetrate deep into the hot halo . at high redshifts  , these cold flows reach the central galaxy and fuel star formation . at , in the case of a halo , the filaments penetrate to only half the virial radius , but can fragment into dense , cold clouds via shocks , cooling instabilities , or other mechanisms . as these clouds are virialized within the halo , they will acquire a large velocity dispersion and produce a large , as discussed above . however , we do not consider cold inflow from the igm to be the most likely origin of the cool halo gas we observe . first , our detection of halo absorption and k halo absorption in this system ( as noted in ; see also figure and table ) may indicate that the absorbing gas is enriched with metals and dust . we can not measure the metallicity or dust content of this system directly , as we lack the necessary spectral coverage . however , strong absorption systems in the redshift range have been shown to significantly redden background qsos ; furthermore , the degree of reddening increases with . find that for absorbers with at , the mean rest - frame ( see their equation 18 ) . they also find that absorbers with have an average dust - to - metals ratio close to those measured in the milky way ism . similar results for the mean dust - to - metals ratio of strong absorbers have been reported by , who additionally show that dust content increases with larger ( see also * ? ? ? as noted above , the absorption we observe has an value as large as the strongest absorbers in these studies . these findings suggest that there may be a substantial amount of dust in this system . second , we do not resolve individual gas clouds because of our low spectral resolution  ; however , we note that the absorption line profiles in figure exhibit asymmetry . find that cool gas clouds distributed such that the gas density is proportional to the total matter density in an isothermal spherical halo tend to produce a symmetric velocity profile , although this depends on the number of absorbing clouds in the halo and the particular sightline observed . both the likely high dust content of the absorption system and the line profile asymmetry suggest an alternate origin for the observed cool gas . we next consider whether the observed halo gas could have plausibly originated in the ism of the host galaxy or progenitor galaxies which was ejected during a previous starburst , merger or luminous agn phase . if this phase occurred gyr ago ( as is likely ; see ) , cool outflows would have had to reach speeds of only to reach a projected distance of kpc today , where is the angle between the plane of the sky and the path taken by the gas . cool outflows commonly reach speeds in excess of in starburst galaxies and have even been observed in post - starburst galaxies at intermediate redshifts . cool gas which has been tidally stripped from the progenitor galaxies of this merger remnant may also give rise to enriched halo absorption with large , provided that the velocity spread in the stripped clouds is large enough . the magellanic stream , for instance , has a velocity dispersion of , and so could not produce the observed in the absence of other clouds . additionally , anisotropic ejection of gas clouds or tidal streams could easily produce asymmetric absorption line profiles . we conclude that cool ism which was driven or stripped out of the galactic star - forming regions during a past starburst , merger or agn phase is a plausible origin for this gas . if in reality the gas originated in a cold inflow or halo condensation as discussed in , our finding that the galaxy experienced a starburst gyr ago is simply a coincidence , and is not necessarily related to the observed absorbing gas . we note that it is unlikely that there is ongoing expulsion of ism , as there is little current star formation activity in the galaxy , and the observed agn activity is weak . therefore , in this scenario , once the cool gas was ejected or stripped , it is likely to have remained cold for approximately 1 gyr , i.e. , since the starburst activity . the analysis of suggests that ejected hot gas could not have cooled through condensation , although again , the assumptions made in that analysis may not apply in this case . cool gas clouds ejected or stripped from the ism and moving through a hot medium may be subject to the kelvin - helmholtz instability . showed that such disturbances on the surface of a cloud can not completely disrupt the cloud unless its cooling time is longer than its sound crossing time . following , we assume an isothermal halo with temperature and with gas density profile , where is the cosmic baryon fraction , and is the maximum rotation velocity of the halo ( equal to the virial velocity in this case ; see for details ) . we assume that the cool clouds are at and that they immediately come into pressure equilibrium with the surrounding hot gas as soon as they enter the halo . the sound crossing time for a cloud is given by the ratio of the cloud radius to the cloud sound speed  . to calculate the cooling time of the cloud , we use equation 33 from . we find that the sound crossing time exceeds the cooling time by at least one order of magnitude for clouds with masses out to the halo virial radius ( kpc ) . we expect that these clouds will be stable against the kelvin - helmholtz instability . we also note that the clouds at the upper end of this mass range are evaporated by conduction on timescales of gyr , where the evaporation timescale is given by equation 35 in . if we assume that the hot gas profile does not change substantially with time , we can conclude that cold clouds driven into the halo from the ism during a starburst or merger occurring gyr ago should remain cold today , and indeed for at least 1 gyr more . outflow during the past starburst , merger or luminous agn event may have been powered by a variety of mechanisms . the galaxy evolution model advocated by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) suggests that in a gas rich major merger gas is driven to the center of the galaxies once they have coalesced , fueling powerful starburst activity and black hole growth and igniting a luminous qso . feedback from supernovae explosions is well known to drive outflows in starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and could have contributed all of the power needed to accelerate the cool ism to velocities of . simulations of major mergers show that they can generate a shock - heated gas wind , possibly forcing cool gas into the halo . in addition , gas from the ism that was tidally stripped during a merger event may have been left behind at large impact parameters . finally , a luminous agn could have contributed to driving cool gas into the galactic halo and to the quenching of star formation . in the scenario , the phase in which the remaining ism material is blown away and the qso is revealed is expected to occur within a few hundred myr of the merger itself . the phase in which the qso has faded and the merger remnant reddens and exhibits a post - starburst stellar continuum occurs after the merger . our results on the star formation history , colors , and morphology of this galaxy fit well into this scenario . however , we note that we have the strongest evidence that the galaxy is post - starburst ; the occurrence of a quasar phase is purely speculative . we also consider whether clouds ejected from the ism would have a large spread in velocities of 1 gyr after the starburst event has ceased . to determine this , we construct a toy model of the behavior of the outflowing gas inside the halo potential . to start , we follow and assume that the velocity  of the outflowing gas as a function of distance from the starburst region  is given by , where is the halo velocity dispersion , is the lower limit on the starburst luminosity needed to expel a large fraction of the galaxy s gas when it is optically thick , and is the initial radius of the outflow . this equation applies until the terminal velocity is reached , . for , kpc and , the gas is driven to radii of kpc during a 100 myr - long starburst . the results are insensitive to the choice of as long as ; however , and must have values such that the gas does not fall back onto the galaxy in 1 gyr . if kpc , values of are viable ; if is doubled , slightly lower values of yield cloud distances and velocities high enough so that they remain in the halo for the necessary amount of time . we then assume that the starburst ends abruptly , and that the clouds from the wind are now subject only to the gravitational potential of the halo , and neglect the effect of drag forces from the surrounding hot halo gas . by integrating the equations of motion for clouds with distances kpc and with initial velocities given by the above equation for , we calculate the final positions and velocities after 1 gyr . a bipolar geometry for the outflow with an opening angle of is assumed , consistent with measurements of the opening angle of the outflow cones traced by h and co emission in m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , such that our line of sight intersects both outflow cones and is parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the cones . we calculate the line - of - sight velocities for the clouds that are at a projected distance of kpc after 1 and 2 gyr . the velocity spread is well above at both time increments . while this model is quite rudimentary , it indicates that clouds driven out of a galaxy 1 gyr ago may have the large velocity dispersion that is observed , and that they will maintain this large dispersion for at least another 1 gyr . from all of the evidence discussed above , we conclude that the absorption system is most likely gaseous fragments of the ism from the merger remnant we observe . this gas may have been ejected by a wind driven by a starburst , merger , or agn , or tidally stripped from the progenitor galaxies . if indeed these clouds originated in the ism , this is one of the first measurements of the radial extent of such outflows or tidally stripped gas in the distant universe and suggests that it reaches far beyond the stellar disk . because the clouds we observe are likely dusty ( see ) , this mechanism may be responsible for distributing the diffuse dust detected in galaxy halos to projected separations much larger than the scales of galactic disks . a complementary method which has recently been used to study the host galaxies of absorption systems measures the clustering strength of a large sample of absorbers with respect to that of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , to determine the mean halo masses in which absorbers of varying strengths are found . these studies have shown that there is a weak anticorrelation between and the bias of systems at . this has been interpreted as an anticorrelation with mean absorber halo mass , significant at the 1 level ; i.e. , absorbers with 1.0 1.5 have mean halo mass , while absorbers have mean halo mass ( ; see also and ) . the number of absorbers in these studies is relatively small ; however , the we infer for our foreground absorber , while higher than the mean halo mass of strong absorbers quoted above , is well within the uncertainties in the estimates of the mean halo masses for both weak and strong absorbers ( see figure 7c , * ? ? ? one explanation proposed by for the origin of strong absorbers suggests that cool gas is driven into galaxy halos via starburst - driven winds . these authors propose that winds are more likely to remove gas from galactic disks in shallower potential wells , and therefore expect strong absorbers to be preferentially found in lower - mass halos . show , however , that the clustering of strong absorbers is unbiased with respect to dark matter halos and thus strong absorption does not occur preferentially at low masses . furthermore , the present study provides one example of strong absorption which is most likely due to past outflow or merger activity in a high mass  halo . our result implies that while galactic winds may be an important source of cool halo gas , they should not necessarily be the dominant contributor in only low mass halos , and indeed must not occur preferentially in lower mass halos if they are to fully explain the bias results of . an alternative picture is inspired by simulations of , e.g. , and , which provide evidence for the transition \" halo mass , above which cold gas is shock heated as it is accreted onto a halo as discussed in . find that an anticorrelation between and , as well as the observed frequency distribution of absorbers , can be reproduced in a halo occupation model which includes such a transition mass , so that the most massive halos are mostly too hot to produce large while lower mass halos contain more cool gas and can give rise to high systems . as shown in , cold flows can partially penetrate through the hot gas in massive halos at and form cold clouds , which may even then fuel further star formation . while our galaxy is unusual in that it is post - starburst , the existence of an enriched system in a halo with a mass well above the transition mass \" is consistent with this picture , and if the observed gas originated in an outflow , implies that ( 1 ) the effects of star formation on halo gas are observed well into the mass regime in which hot gas accretion dominates the total gas accretion , or ( 2 ) there is a spread in transition mass for different galaxy halos . using multiwavelength analysis of the luminous components of a galaxy at in concert with spectroscopy of a bright , close transverse background galaxy at , we demonstrate that the cool gas traced by absorption in the foreground galaxy halo at impact parameter kpc most likely originated in the ism of the host galaxy or its progenitors . this galaxy has little ongoing star formation and exhibits only weak agn activity ; however , it experienced a starburst gyr ago , which may have been triggered by a merger event . the cool halo gas could have easily been driven or stripped away from the star - forming regions during this past violent phase , and could have survived in the hot halo since that time . our rudimentary toy model for the motions of clouds driven into the halo by a past starburst suggests that these clouds would have a large velocity dispersion today , consistent with our observations . we emphasize that the analysis of the luminous components of this galaxy achieves an unprecedented level of detail in the context of studies of distant absorption - selected galaxies with . such detail is possible because of the rich dataset available in goods , including the galaxy redshifts from tkrs and our lris spectroscopy . we were able to identify the post - starburst and age - date it using this dataset ; previous works could not necessarily find such a galaxy , and thus present a less complete view of the host galaxies of strong absorbers . searched for emission near absorbers at to investigate a starburst origin for absorption ; this method can not be used to identify host galaxies without emission , such as post - starbursts with weak agn activity . investigated environments of absorbers by imaging the corresponding qso fields ; however , they lacked spectroscopic confirmation of galaxy - absorber associations and have not constrained the star formation history of absorber hosts . our study only begins to demonstrate the power of using background galaxies to probe foreground halo gas . several large spectroscopic surveys have recently concluded or are nearing completion that can be used to identify pairs suitable for a targeted search for foreground absorption . spectroscopic followup with an instrument such as lris requires that the background source be bright and blue so that a continuum signal - to - noise ratio of at can be acquired in a reasonable exposure time ( i.e. , in less than 4 hours ) . this is needed to achieve a ew detection limit of 0.5 for a absorber at . there are galaxy pairs with redshifts measured as part of the deep2 survey of the extended groth strip ( egs ) with angular separations which meet these requirements . surveys such as combo-17 and zcosmos will provide pair candidates in numbers on the same order as deep2 , as will the forthcoming vimos vlt surveys . the primus surveyeisenste / primus / home.html ] will take galaxy spectra over 10 square degrees and should enable selection of over 1500 galaxy pairs . the pan - starrs survey , which will image 1200 square degrees in 4 filters to , will provide an unprecedented number of photometric redshifts . using the average sampling rate and the average redshift success rate of the egs portion of the deep2 survey to scale the number of pair candidates to that expected from a photometric survey , and additionally scaling by the 2400-fold increase in sky coverage with pan - starrs , we expect that galaxy pairs will be available for spectroscopic followup . the use of galaxies as background probes is complementary to analysis of grb sightlines , which have a negligible beam size but similarly allow for close analysis of the absorber host . in good seeing conditions and with extended background galaxies , one may probe multiple sightlines through a given foreground halo . size scales smaller than kpc at are not currently accessible because of seeing limitations . however , with adaptive optics and ifus on 10m - class telescopes and beyond , spatially extended background galaxies will enable study of the morphology and kinematics of halo absorption in concert with detailed analysis of the luminous components of absorber hosts . the authors wish to thank c. tremonti for freely providing her stellar population modeling code , k. cooksey for providing her absorption feature -

{"article": "superconducting josephson junction qubit is one of the most promising candidates for implementing quantum computation . single qubit coherent oscillations in superconducting qubits have been demonstrated experimentally and furthermore two qubit coupling and entanglement have been performed in charge , flux and phase qubits . scalable quantum computing requires controllable and selective coupling between two remote as well as nearest neighbor qubits . recently much theoretical efforts have been devoted on the study about the controllable coupling of charge , charge - phase and flux qubits . for flux qubits the controllable coupling schemes use inductive coupling , but it is too weak to perform efficient two - qubit gate operations . hence , while in superconducting charge qubit two - qubit coherent oscillations and cnot gate operations were experimentally observed , only spectroscopy measurement was done for inductively coupled flux qubit . in this study thus we suggest a scheme to give both strong and tunable coupling between two phase - coupled flux qubits . the phase - coupling scheme , which we previously proposed , has been realized in a recent experiment . the controllable coupling scheme using phase - coupled qubits with threading ac magnetic field was also studied theoretically . further , there have been studies about somewhat different phase - coupling schemes . two current states of a flux qubit are characterized by the induced loop current related with the phase differences across josephson junctions in the qubit loop . if we try to couple two flux qubits using mutual inductance , the coupling strength will be too weak to perform the discriminating cnot gate operations , since the mutual inductance and the induced currents of the left ( right ) qubit is very small . even though the induced currents of flux qubits are weak , the phase differences across josephson junctions are as large as . hence , if two flux qubits are coupled by the phase differences between two josephson junctions of different qubits , we can achieve a strong coupling of the order of josephson coupling energy of the josephson junctions in the connecting loop whose typical value is as large as up to about 200ghz . introducing two dc - squid s interrupting the connecting loop as shown in fig . we can control the coupling between phase - coupled flux qubits . the control fluxes , and , threading two dc - squid loops must be in opposite directions in order to give rise to the controllable coupling . when two fluxes are in the same direction , the change of control fluxes induces an additional current flowing in the connecting loop , causing the shift of qubit states as well as the change of coupling strength . such a dilemma also persists in the case of one dc - squid loop in connecting loop . however , if the control fluxes are in opposite directions , we have found that the additional currents coming from two dc - squid s are cancelled each other and thus the coupling strength can be tunable remaining the qubit states unchanged . the three - josephson junctions qubits in fig . has two current states ; if the qubit current , it is diamagnetic while , if , paramagnetic . introducing the notation for diamagnetic ( paramagnetic ) current state of a qubit in pseudo spin language , there can be four current states of coupled qubits , , , and , of which we show one of the same current states , , and one of the different current states , , in fig . . the phase and of the josephson junctions of the three - josephson junctions qubits have different values if two qubits are in different states . then the phase difference induces the phases in the josephson junctions of dc - squid loops . if we neglect small kinetic inductance , the boundary conditions of the left ( right ) qubit and the connecting loop can be approximately written as where is total flux and with the external flux and the unit flux quantum is dimensionless reduced flux threading the left ( right ) qubit . here with the self inductance and the induced current of qubit loop is the induced flux of each qubit and that of the connecting loop and and are integers . we consider that the external fluxes and threading the qubit loops are also in opposite directions , since they are connected in a twisted way in the scalable design of ref . . however , for just two qubit coupling , we can choose the directions of external fluxes threading the qubit loops arbitrary . actually there is no external flux in the connecting loop , but the phase difference in the boundary condition of eq .  plays the role of effective flux in the connecting loop , when two qubits are in different current state , i.e. , one is diamagnetic and the other paramagnetic , the value of becomes . since the induced flux of flux qubit is so weak as , large value of in the phase - coupled flux qubits can give a strong coupling compared to the inductive coupling scheme . the hamiltonian of the coupled qubits can be given by which describes dynamics of a particle with effective mass in the effective potential with . the kinetic part of the hamiltonian comes from the charging energy of the josephson junctions such as where and is the capacitance of the josephson junctions of the left ( right ) qubit loop and the connecting loop , respectively . the number of excess cooper pair charges on josephson junction is conjugate to the phase difference such as =i$ ] , where , and the capacitance of the josephson junctions . here we introduce the canonical momentum and the effective mass to obtain the kinetic part of the hamiltonian . the effective potential of the coupled qubits is composed of the inductive energy of loops and the josephson junction energy terms ; here is the inductive energy of loops with the current of the right qubit , left qubit and connecting loop . is the energy of the josephson junctions in two qubit loop and that of the connecting loop with josephson coupling energies and . introducing another rotated coordinate and using the boundary conditions in eq .  to get the josephson junction energy of the connecting loop can also be written as \\cos,\\nonumber\\ ] ] where we set and . first of all we consider the case that the control fluxes , and , have opposite directions such that note that the boundary conditions in eq .  already have opposite signs . in order to obtain the effective potential as a function of and , we reexpress as using the boundary conditions in eq .  and the expression in eq .  . here can be written as neglecting small induced flux in the connecting loop . depending on whether is even or odd , the results will be quantitatively different , but qualitatively the same . here and after , thus , we choose is even and specifically , and for simplicity and then becomes and the energy of josephson junctions in connecting loop in eq .  .\\ ] ] since the induced energy can be negligible , the total effective potential in eq .  is given by the sum of the energies in eqs .  and  , the lowest energy level of in plane can be obtained by setting the remaining variable in eq .  as when . we plot the effective potential in fig . ( a ) with four local minima . the value of local minima of case ( i ) can be obtained from and we have found that two local minima have the same value , , for equal pseudo - spin state with . similarly we get of case ( ii ) from for different pseudo - spin state . as a result , we obtain where is the value of at local minima of the same spin states , , and the value of of the different spin states , with thus the energy of the same spin states , , is lower than that of different spin states , , as shown in fig . (a ) . here we set , and . for the same spin states we have two solutions , , corresponding to two local minima , and . when , and and thus using from the boundary condition in eq .  with . since the loop currents of both qubits then are diamagnetic as can be seen from fig . (a ) , this coupled - qubits state can be represented as as shown in fig . (a ) . on the other hand , when , then the qubit current corresponds to the paramagnetic current states , . we would like to note that , since the external fluxes and threading left and right qubit loops are already in opposite directions , diamagnetic ( paramagnetic ) currents of both qubits in  state are also in opposite directions . .the values of phase differences of coupled qubits states in several coordinates with , , and . for different spin states , two solutions are also obtained for . when , for left and right qubit respectively , which corresponds to the state , in fig . ( a ) . in the same way corresponds to the state . hence we can identify four stable states , and , with energies and at the local minima of as shown in fig . ( a ) . even though above four states are stable states in plane , it can be unstable in the other dimensions if they are saddle points . thus we need represent the effective potential in plane . from the expression of in eq .  and the relation in eq .  , we can get and , following similar procedure as in the plane , we obtain the effective potential as shown in fig . ( b ) , where we can again see local minima . in figs . ( b ) , for the states and of case ( i ) , we can get the values and , for case ( ii ) , the values using eqs .  ,  and  and the values of in each case . as a result , we are able to identify the spin states at local minima of figs . ( b ) from fig . ( a ) with above values and confirm the stability of the states in both planes . in table we summarize the values of the phase differences for four states , , of coupled qubits in several coordinates . actually we obtained higher energy states in fig . ( a ) , but found that they are unstable in plane . the hamiltonian of coupled qubits can be written as where and with and is the identity matrix . first two terms are qubit terms , the third is coupling term and last two terms are tunnelling terms which come from the quantum fluctuation described by the kinetic term of the hamiltonian . then the coupling constant of the coupled qubits is given by in fig . we plot the energies of coupled - qubits for various with , and in plane . when in fig . (a ) , the energies of the same spin states , and , are lower than , of the different spin states , and . the positions of four local minima are shown in table . as increases , the energy difference becomes smaller ( upper panel in ( b ) ) and finally at in ( c ) . since and , the coupling strength can be written as therefore the coupling strength between two flux qubits changes as varying the control fluxes threading the dc - squid loop in the connecting loop . from eq .  the coupling constant can be represented as a function of by , which gives in fig . (a ) we plot the energies and as a function of , where . when , is of the order of so that we can obtain a sufficiently strong coupling . by adjusting the coupling strength can be tuned from strong coupling to zero at . the coupling strength in eq .  depends on as well as . when is small , is proportional to and . recently the phase - coupling scheme has been experimentally implemented , where four - josephson junctions qubits are employed instead of usual three - josephson junctions qubits . in that experiment the josephson junction energy of fourth junction is large so that the value of is about . as a result , the experiment exhibits rather small coupling strength . the current of connecting loop can be written as , which gives the relations , and then with integer using the boundary conditions in eq .  . then , using eq .  and the effective flux in eq .  , the current is given by this current - phase relation can be considered as the josephson junction type relation , , with the effective josephson coupling energy , , of two dc - squid s in the connecting loop and the phase difference . the coupling constant in eq .  also can be represented by the effective josephson coupling energy , . thus the large phase difference , , and the josephson coupling energy , , induce the current in the connecting loop and the coupling energy of the phase - coupled qubits . for the same spin states , and , the current of connecting loop becomes zero , since and thus . for a different spin states with , and we have from and the relation in eq .  . then weak current in the connecting loop flows satisfying current conservation condition between left qubit and connecting loop such that for . when approaches , the effective josephson coupling energy and thus the current in connecting loop become zero , which means that the coupling between two qubits is switched off . now we want to explain the case that two control fluxes are in the same directions and the case that there is only single dc - squid in connecting loop . if two control fluxes are in the same direction such as the josephson junction energy of the connecting loop becomes . \\nonumber\\\\\\ ] ] similar procedure as in the case of opposite directions of control fluxes shows that the same spin states , and , have equal energy such as for . for different spin states , and , the energies and are obtained at two local minima which can be derived from eq .  . since the states , and , have different sign for , the second term produces the energy difference where is again one of the values of for the different spin states . figure (b ) ( lower panel ) for shows that , when two control fluxes are in the same direction , the energies and are different while . the energy levels of are plotted in fig . (b ) . in this case the effective fluxes and applied to left and right qubits in the hamiltonian of eq .  become different each other , , as increases from zero . for the different current state in fig . (b ) , if the control fluxes and threading the dc - squid loops are in the same direction , the increased current in the connecting loop will flow through the left and right qubit loops . thus the qubit states are influenced by additional effective fluxes , which will makes the two - qubit operations difficult . however , if two control fluxes and are in opposite directions , the energies of different spin states remains equal to each other , , as shown in fig . (a ) . this means that the additional currents coming from two dc - squid s are cancelled each other and total additional current induced by the control fluxes and is vanishing in the connecting loop . as a result , the net effect is just renormalizing the coupling constant of the coupled qubit system . we also calculated energies of coupled qubit states with single dc - squid loop whose boundary conditions become instead of those in eqs .  and  . then we get the josephson junction energies of the dc - squid , which gives results similar to those of two dc - squid s with fluxes in the same direction such that for and as shown in fig . (c ) . hence the behaviors of one dc - squid in the connecting loop are qualitatively the same as those of two dc - squid s with fluxes in the same direction . therefore we need two control fluxes threading dc - squid s in opposite directions to cancel the additional currents in the connecting loop for obtaining the controllable coupling . in order to obtain the controllable coupling both the qubit operating flux , , and control flux , , of the left qubit become in opposite direction to those of the right qubit , and as shown in fig . . in real experiments it will be very hard to apply magnetic fluxes of different directions simultaneously . we have previously suggested a scalable design for phase - coupled flux qubits , where an arbitrary pair of qubits are coupled in a twisted way . thus just applying all magnetic fluxes in the same direction makes automatically the effect of fluxes in opposite directions , removing the experimental difficulty . the recent experiment on the phase - coupled flux qubits without dc - squid loop has shown that the coupled qubit states are in quantum mechanically superposed regime . the dc - squid loops in the connecting loop of the present tunable coupling scheme may cause a decoherence effect on the coupled qubit states . a recent study argued that the dc - squid based oscillator should be the main source of the decoherence of the flux qubits . for the scalable design in ref . , however , the decoherence from two dc - squid s can be reduced . since two dc - squid s are connected in a twisted way , the fluctuations from tank circuit or flux lines can be cancelled each other . in realistic implementation of qubit operations , operating external fluxes are slightly different from the co - resonance point , , and moreover we can not any more neglect small kinetic inductance and induced fluxes . hence we confirmed the results in this study by numerical calculation using the exact boundary conditions similar to those in eqs .  , current - phase relation and current conservation conditions . controllable coupling between two phase - coupled flux qubits can be achieved by using two dc - squid s in the connecting loop with threading fluxes in opposite directions . we analytically show at co - resonance point  that the coupling strength of the phase - coupled flux qubits can be adjusted by varying the threading fluxes from to ; it can be as strong as o and zero in switching - off limit . when either two control fluxes are in the same directions or there is only one dc - squid in the connecting loop , the coupled qubits can not be described by the coupling hamiltonian . in slightly different parameter regimes of experimental implementations numerical calculations can be done to obtain exact results . 1 y. makhlin , g. schn , and a. shnirman , rev . phys . * 73 * , 357 ( 2001 ) ;

{"article": "in 1985 , hoare s paper a couple of novelties in the propositional calculus was published . in this paper the ternary connective is introduced as the conditional . with and denoting programs and a boolean expression . ] a more common expression for a conditional statement is but in order to reason systematically with conditional statements , a notation such as is preferable . in a conditional statement , first is evaluated , and depending on that evaluation result , then either or is evaluated ( and the other is not ) and determines the evaluation value . this evaluation strategy is a form of short - circuit evaluation . in , hoare proves that propositional logic is characterized by eleven equational axioms , some of which employ constants and for the truth values and . in 2011 , we introduced proposition algebra in as a general approach to the study of the conditional : we defined several valuation congruences and provided equational axiomatizations of these congruences . the most basic and least identifying valuation congruence is free valuation congruence , which is axiomatized by the axioms in table . ' '' '' ' '' '' these axioms stem from and define the conditional as a primitive connective . we use the name ( for conditional propositions ) for this set of axioms . interpreting a conditional statement as an if - then - else expression , axioms are natural , and axiom ( distributivity ) can be clarified by case analysis : if evaluates to and as well , then determines the result of evaluation ; if evaluates to and evaluates to , then determines the result of evaluation , and so on and so forth . in section we characterize free valuation congruence with help of evaluation trees : given a conditional statement , its evaluation tree directly represents all its evaluations ( in the way a truth table does in the case of propositional logic ) . two conditional statements are equivalent with respect to free valuation congruence if their evaluation trees are equal . evaluation trees are simple binary trees , proposed by daan staudt in ( that appeared in 2012 ) . free valuation congruence identifies less than the equivalence defined by hoare s axioms in . for example , the atomic proposition and the conditional statement are not equivalent with respect to free valuation congruence , although they are equivalent with respect to static valuation congruence , which is the valuation congruence that characterizes propositional logic . a valuation congruence that identifies more than free and less than static valuation congruence is repetition - proof valuation congruence , which has an axiomatization that comprises two more ( schematic ) axioms , one of which reads and thus expresses that if evaluates to , a consecutive evaluation of also evaluates to , so the conditional statement at the -position will not be evaluated and can be replaced by any other . as an example , , and the left - hand and right - hand conditional statements are equivalent with respect to repetition - proof valuation congruence , but are not equivalent with respect to free valuation congruence . in section we characterize repetition - proof valuation congruence by defining a transformation on evaluation trees that yields repetition - proof evaluation trees : two conditional statements are equivalent with respect to repetition - proof valuation congruence if , and only if , they have equal repetition - proof evaluation trees . although this transformation on evaluation trees is simple and natural , our proof of the mentioned characterization |which is phrased as a completeness result| is non - trivial and we could not find a proof that is essentially simpler . valuation congruences that identify more conditional statements than repetition - proof valuation congruence are contractive , memorizing , and static valuation congruence , and these are all defined and axiomatized in . in sections , each of these valuation congruences is characterized using a transformation on evaluation trees : two conditional statements are c - valuation congruent if , and only if , their c - transformed evaluation trees are equal . these transformations are simple and natural , and only for static valuation congruence we use a slightly more complex transformation . in section we discuss the general structure of the proofs of these results , which are all based on normalization of conditional statements . the paper ends with a brief digression on short - circuit logic , an example on the use of repetition - proof valuation congruence , and some remarks about side effects . a spin - off of our approach can be called `` basic form semantics for proposition algebra '' : for each valuation congruence c that we consider ( including the case c = free ) , two conditional statements are c - valuation congruent if , and only if , they have equal c - basic forms , where c - basic forms are obtained by a syntactic transformation of conditional statements , which is a form of normalization . consider the signature with constants and for the truth values and , respectively , and constants for atomic propositions , further called atoms , from some countable set . we write for the set of closed terms , or conditional statements , over the signature . given a conditional statement , we refer to as its central condition . we define the dual of as follows : observe that is a self - dual axiomatization : when defining for each variable , the dual of each axiom is also in , and hence a natural view on conditional statements in involves short - circuit evaluation , similar to how we consider the evaluation of an `` '' expression . the following definition is taken from . the set of * evaluation trees over with leaves in * is defined inductively by the operator is called * post - conditional composition over *. in the evaluation tree , the root is represented by , the left branch by and the right branch by . we refer to trees in as evaluation trees , or trees for short . post - conditional composition and its notation stem from . evaluation trees play a crucial role in the main results of . in order to define our `` evaluation tree semantics '' , we first define the leaf replacement operator , ` replacement ' for short , on trees in as follows . let and . the replacement of with and with in , denoted ,\\ ] ] is defined by &= y,\\\\ { }}&= z,\\\\ ( x'{{{\\footnotesize}}}a{{{\\footnotesize}}}x'') & = x'{{{\\footnotesize}}}a{{{\\footnotesize}}}x''.\\ ] ] we note that the order in which the replacements of leaves of is listed is irrelevant and we adopt the convention of not listing identities inside the brackets , e.g. , =x\\;~~\\;\\;~~\\;\\;~~\\; a { }} a { }} { }}\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\; ] , and thus . the two remaining cases can be proved in a similar way . for all , we first prove . by lemma , is a congruence relation and it easily follows that all -axioms are sound . for example , soundness of axiom follows from \\\\ & = \\big(se(r)\\big)\\;\\\\ & = se(r) , { }}\\mapsto \\,se(s)]\\\\ & = se(r)\\\\ & = se((p{{{\\footnotesize}}}q{{{\\footnotesize}}}u){{{\\footnotesize}}}r{{{\\footnotesize}}}(p{{{\\footnotesize}}}s{{{\\footnotesize}}}u)).\\ ] ] in order to prove , let . according to lemma there exist basic forms and such that and , so . by soundness  we find , so by lemma , . hence , . a consequence of the above results is that for each there is a unique basic form with , and that for each basic form , its -image has exactly the same syntactic structure ( replacing by , and by ) . in the remainder of this section , we make this precise . the * basic form function * is defined as follows , where : .\\ ] ] given , the auxiliary function :{ a}} a}} ] is adopted , is defined as follows : &=q,\\\\ { }}&=r,\\\\ ( p 1{{{\\footnotesize}}}a{{{\\footnotesize}}}p 2) & = p 1{{{\\footnotesize}}}a{{{\\footnotesize}}}p 2.\\ ] ] ( the notational overloading with the leaf replacement functions on valuation trees is harmless ) . so , for given , the auxiliary function ] ) replaces all -occurrences in by , and all -occurrences in by . the following two lemma s imply that is a normalization function . for all , is a basic form . by structural induction . the base cases are trivial . for the inductive case we find \\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\; ] , and thus . the two remaining cases can be proved in a similar way . before proving that is an axiomatization of the relation , we show that each instance of the axiom satisfies . for all , by definition , the lemma s statement is equivalent with \\big)\\;\\\\ & = { }}(p).\\ ] ] by lemma , , ,and are basic forms . we prove by structural induction on the form that can have . if , then \\big)&\\; { }}(p 1) \\ ] ] and & = { }}(q 1{{{\\footnotesize}}}p 1{{{\\footnotesize}}}q 2)\\\\ & = { }}(p 1).\\ ] ] if , then follows in a similar way . the inductive case is trivial ( by definition of the last defining clause of the auxiliary functions a { }} a { }} { }} a { }} a { }} { }} a a a { }} { }} { }} { }} a { }} { }} a b a { }} { }} { }} { }} a b { }} { }} { }}\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\;\\;\\triangleleft~~\\triangleright\\; a b a { }} { }} { }} { }} a b { }} { }} b { }} { }} b a { }} { }} a { }} { }} a b { }} { }} b { }} { }} b a { }} { }} a { }} { }} ] and $ ] ( and is also defined for short - circuited disjunction ) , and the associated completeness proof is based on decomposition properties of such evaluation trees . for repetition - proof valuation congruence it is an open question whether a finite , equational axiomatization of the short - circuited binary propositional connectives exists , and an investigation of repetition - proof evaluation trees defined by such connectives might be of interest in this respect . we conclude with an example on the use of that is based on ( * ? ? ? * ex.4 ) . let be a set of atoms of the form ` ( e==e ' ) ` and ` ( n = e ) ` with some initialized program variable and arithmetical expressions over the integers that may contain . assume that ` ( e==e ' ) ` evaluates to if and represent the same value , and ` ( n = e ) ` always evaluates to true with the effect that s value is assigned to . then these atoms satisfy the axioms of . follow from , e.g. , . we note that a particular consequence of in the setting of short - circuit logic is ( cf . example ) , and that example is related to the work of wortel , where an instance of propositional dynamic logic is investigated in which assignments can be turned into tests ; the assumption that such tests always evaluate to true is natural because the assumption that assignments always succeed is natural . ] notice that if has initial value 0 or 1 , and evaluate to different results , so the atom ` ( n = n+1 ) ` does not satisfy the law , by which this example is typical for the repetition - proof characteristic of . end example . we finally note that all valuation congruences considered in this paper can be used as a basis for systematic analysis of the kind of side effects that may occur upon the evaluation of short -

{"article": "the presence of a surfactant film at a fluid - fluid interface alters the dynamics of the interface . this is manifested in behavior of the interfacial waves , induced either externally or by thermal fluctuations . the interfacial dynamics can be probed by measuring the light scattered on such surface waves ( see the review by earnshaw ) . the scattering of light on surface waves is a powerful tool for probing the properties of surfactant films at fluid interfaces , and a variety of systems have been recently investigated using this method ( e.g. refs , see also the review by cicuta and hopkinson ) . recently , the application of surfactant films to modify the interfacial properties has been extended to the systems in which one of the fluids is in liquid - crystalline phase ( e.g. liquid crystal colloids ) . the presence of a liquid crystal as one of the fluids complicates the problem of probing the interfacial properties by studying the dynamics of the surface waves for the following reasons . firstly , there are additional degrees of freedom in the bulk of the liquid crystal phase due to its anisotropy . secondly , the interaction with the surfactant film is more complicated due to anisotropic anchoring . finally , the surfactant film in the anisotropic field created by the neighboring liquid crystal can itself show anisotropic behavior , even if it behaves as an two - dimensional isotropic fluid at the boundary between isotropic fluids . a promising new direction for chemical and biological sensing devices has recently emerged which utilizes the properties of surfactant films self - assembled on the interface between water and a nematic liquid crystal . the surfactant film induces preferred orientation of the nematic director . the adsorption of chemical or biological molecules at such interface can then lead to reorientation of the nematic director , enabling detection by an imaging system . in these methods , easy detection is limited to the systems in which adsorption changes anchoring properties of the interface with respect to the adjacent liquid crystal phase quite considerably . namely , the equilibrium anchoring angle should change in magnitude . the range of application of these systems could be made significantly broader , however , if a method were used that was sensitive to changes in the anchoring properties of the interface that did not necessarily result in nematic director reorientation . for example , the anchoring orientation may remain unchanged , the adsorption only changing the strength of the anchoring . if a small amount of an analyte is present in the water it may be adsorbed at the surfactant layer , provided the surfactant molecules possess appropriate chemical properties . generally , such adsorption will result in a change in the elastic and viscous properties of the interface . hence sensitive experiments which are able to determine the interfacial properties will allow much more detailed experimental insight into the properties of the interaction between the surfactants and the analyte than has hitherto been available , and experimental study of surface waves is a possible technique for this purpose . the theoretical description of surface waves at interfaces between nematic and isotropic liquids was made back in 1970s . the results demonstrated that the spectrum of surface waves has a more complicated structure than in the isotropic case , and allows the use surface scattering experiments to determine properties of nematic interfaces . since then , several theoretical and experimental advances have been made , and presently these systems remain a subject of investigation . the present paper presents a theoretical study of the dispersion of the surface waves at a monomolecular surfactant film between an isotropic liquid ( e.g. water ) and a nematic liquid crystal.the main distinguishing features of such interfaces , are ( i ) the anchoring induced by the surfactant layer , ( ii ) the curvature energy of the interface , ( iii ) reduction of surface tension due to surfactant , and ( iv ) the anisotropy of the surface viscoelastic coefficients . we base our treatment on the mechanical model for anisotropic curved interfaces by rey , which takes into account anchoring and bending properties of the surfactant . we consider the case of the insoluble surfactant film that is in its most symmetric phase ( isotropic two - dimensional fluid ) , and induces homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) orientation of the director . the paper is organized as follows . the continuum model used in the rest of the paper is set up in section . in section the dispersion relation for surface waves is derived . in section the numerical solution of the dispersion relation is solved with typical values of material parameters , and dispersion laws for different surface modes are analyzed in absence of the external magnetic field , and the influence of the magnetic field is discussed in section . the explicit form of the dispersion relation is written in appendix . in this section we formulate the model of the surfactant - laden interface between an isotropic liquid and a nematic liquid crystal , used in the present paper , and write down the governing equations . we base our treatment upon the models of the nematic - isotropic interface by rey , and well known hydrodynamic description of isotropic liquids and nematic liquid crystals . we consider the case when the surfactant film induces homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) orientation of the nematic director , which is usually true in a range of the surfactant concentrations . this case is the simplest to analyze , and , at the same time , the most important for biosensing applications where the direct change in anchoring angle can not be always observed . we include optional external magnetic field in our study and limit our analysis by considering the direction of the magnetic field that does not change equilibrium orientation of the nematic director . we assume that the system is far enough from any phase transitions both in the surfactant film and in the nematic phase . thus we avoid complications related to the fluctuations of the nematic and surfactant order parameters and the divergence of viscoelastic parameters near phase transitions . the surfactant films can exhibit rich phase behavior , and the form of the surface stress tensor depends upon the symmetry of the interface . however , this does not normally influence much the dispersion laws of the surface modes compared to the isotropic case . in the present paper we assume that the surfactant film is in the most symmetric phase ( isotropic two - dimensional fluid ) . although the symmetry of the film should break in presence of the adjacent liquid - crystalline bulk phase , the film remains isotropic in equilibrium if the anchoring of the nematic is homeotropic , and symmetry breaking can occur only due to fluctuations of the director field . if we introduce the order parameter for the film , the corresponding anisotropic contributions to the interfacial stress tensor would be of higher order in the fluctuations of the dynamic variables than is required in our linearized treatment , so such contributions can be omitted . we consider a surfactant layer at an interface between nematic and isotropic liquids to be macroscopically infinitely thin . we assume that the surfactant film is insoluble and newtonian . this means that the model is applicable to systems in which the interchange of surfactant molecules between the interface and adjacent bulk fluids is small , and the relaxation of the orientation of surfactant molecules is fast compared to relaxation of surface waves . we also assume heat diffusion to be sufficiently fast so that the system is in thermal equilibrium . we do not consider systems where other effects , such as polarity , are important . we shall choose coordinate system in such a way that the unperturbed interface lies at a plane , the half - space is occupied by the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal , and the half - space is filled by the isotropic liquid . other details of the geometry used in the present paper are summarized in appendix . the central equations in the present section are the conditions for the balance of forces ( eq .  and torques ( eq .  at the interface . the explicit form of these equations depends upon the chosen macroscopic model , and the rest of this section is devoted to formulation of the model used in the present paper . the interfacial force balance equation is the balance between the interfacial force and the bulk stress jump : here is the force per unit area exerted by the interfacial stress , is the force per unit area exerted by the isotropic fluid , is the force per unit area exerted by the nematic liquid crystal , the subscript indicates that the bulk stress fields in the isotropic liquid , , and in the nematic , , are evaluated at the interface , is the unit vector normal to the interface and directed into the isotropic liquid . the interfacial torque balance equation can be cast as where is the interfacial torque arising due to surface interactions , is the torque exerted upon the interface by the adjacent nematic liquid crystal . the explicit model for surface and bulk stresses and torques that enter eqs  and ( eq .  is expanded in the remainder of this section . in this and the following subsections we summarize the equations for the surface stress tensor and surface torque vector . we represent these quantities as a sum of corresponding non - dissipative ( elastic ) and dissipative ( viscous ) contributions : to describe the non - dissipative contributions in the surface stress tensor , , and surface torque vector , , we use the equilibrium model proposed by rey , which is summarized below . rey considered the interface with the helmholtz free energy per unit mass of the form where is the surface mass density , is the second fundamental tensor of the interface ( see appendix ) . the corresponding differential was written as where {\\mathbf k,\\mathbf b}\\ ] ] is the interfacial tension , is the tangential component of the capillary vector ( is the surface projector ) , and is the bending moment tensor . the elastic surface stress tensor was found to be where the tangential surface molecular field is given by is surface gradient operator , denotes variational derivative with respect to . the elastic contribution to surface torque was written as where is the surface couple stress , is the levi - civita tensor , and is the surface alternator tensor . the viscous properties of interfaces between an isotropic fluid and a nematic liquid crystal were considered in detail by rey , and the results are summarized below . the forces and fluxes that contribute to the dissipation function were identified as follows : where and are , correspondingly , symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the surface viscous stress tensor , and are the components of the surface viscous molecular field tangential and normal to the surface , \\ ] ] is the surface rate - of - deformation tensor ( denotes the transposed tensor ) , \\ ] ] is the surface vorticity tensor , is surface velocity , and are the total time derivatives of the components and of the nematic director field , tangential and normal to the surface , correspondingly . generally , presence of the surfactant film at the interface complicates the form of the entropy production due to additional internal degrees of freedom of the surfactant , and to the anisotropy of the adjacent nematic liquid . however , if the surfactant film that is in its isotropic liquid phase and favors homeotropic anchoring of the nematic , the resulting anisitropic terms in the entropy production introduce corrections to the hydrodynamic equations of higher order than linear , and therefore can be neglected in the linearized treatment . since this is the case we are considering , we shall adopt the form of the entropy production  in our model and use the form of the viscous contribution to the surface stress tensor derived by rey , which is given by ,\\ ] ] where is the surface jaumann ( corrotational ) derivative of the tangential component of the director , and , are nine independent surface viscosity coefficients . in the isotropic case , the expression for the surface viscous stress tensor reduces to the viscous stress tensor of boussinesq - schriven surface fluid with the interfacial shear viscosity given by and dilatational viscosity given by the surface viscous torque , corresponding to eq .  , is given by where the surface viscous molecular field is the viscosity coefficients can be expressed in terms of quantities . we shall need only the expression for the tangential rotational viscosity : to calculate explicitly the interfacial tension ( eq .  ) , the tangential component of the capillary vector ( eq .  ) , and the bending moment tensor ( eq .  ) , we need to know the dependence of the surface free energy on the orientation of the interface given by unit normal vector , and on its curvature described by second fundamental tensor . for small deviations of and from equilibrium , we can expand the free energy in powers of these quantities and truncate the series . the result can be represented as each of the contribution described below . the contribution corresponds to the surface tension of the equilibrium interface ( flat interface , adjacent nematic director normal to the interface ) : the anchoring contribution to the surface free energy density , , describes the energetics of the preferred alignment direction of the nematic director relative to the interface . for the homeotropic equilibrium anchoring , it can be written in terms of as follows : such expansion applied to the widely used rapini - papoular form of the anchoring free energy density shows that these definitions of the anchoring strength coefficient have opposite signs : we shall use as the anchoring strength coefficient to ensure that it is positive in the case of the homeotropic anchoring being considered . the third contribution to the surface free energy density , , is caused by finite interface thickness , and is related to the difference of the curvature of a surfactant film from the locally preferred ( spontaneous ) value . the widely used form of this contribution is the helfrich curvature expansion here the geometry of the interface is described by the mean curvature and the gaussian curvature , and the material parameters characterizing the interface are the bending rigidity , the saddle - splay ( or gaussian ) rigidity , and the spontaneous curvature . the term guarantees that the curvature energy of a flat interface ( , ) is zero . to complete the description of the interface , we need the continuity equation for the surfactant concentration . for insoluble surfactants , the continuity equation reads : we shall extend the description of the dependence of the interfacial tension upon the concentration of surfactant , presented by buzza , to other parameters characterizing the interface ( surface tension , anchoring strength , bending rigidity , saddle - splay rigidity , spontaneous curvature , and surface viscosities , ) . for small deviation of the surfactant concentration from its equilibrium value , these coefficients can be written in form and similarly for other quantities . casting surface velocity as the time derivative of the small surface displacement , we obtain from the continuity equation eq .  that this allows us to represent the material parameters of the interface as in these formulas , , , are , correspondingly , the interfacial tension , anchoring strength , bending rigidity , and spontaneous curvature in the unperturbed interface , is the static dilatational elasticity , , , and are coefficients in the first order term of the expansion of anchoring strength , bending rigidity , and spontaneous curvature in powers of  . there are similar expansions for gaussian rigidity and surface viscosities , . magnetic field in the isotropic and nematic regions satisfies maxwell equations neglecting magnetization of the interface , the boundary conditions read here the magnetization of the isotropic liquid is where is the magnetic permeability of the isotropic liquid , the magnetization of the uniaxial nematic liquid crystal is where is the difference of the longitudinal and transversal magnetic permeabilities of the nematic : we assume both the isotropic liquid and the nematic liquid crystal are incompressible , so that their densities and , are constant . the linearized equations for the incompressible isotropic liquid are well known . they are the continuity equation and navier - stokes equations where the hydrodynamic stress tensor is given by where is the shear viscosity of the isotropic liquid , is the unit tensor , \\ ] ] is the strain rate tensor . we assume the non - slip boundary condition for the velocities of bulk fluids adjacent to the interface , which means the equality of the velocity of surfactant , , and that of the bulk fluids at an interface , : to describe the dynamics of the nematic liquid crystal that is far from the isotropic - nematic transition and has small deviations from its equilibrium state , we shall use the linearized form of the eriksen - leslie theory . the linearized equations for the incompressible nematic liquid crystal are the continuity equation  , the equation for the velocity and the equation for the director here \\ ] ] is the antisymmetric vorticity tensor , is the reactive material parameter , is orientational viscosity , is the molecular field which , assuming frank form of the elastic free energy of a nematic liquid crystal in magnetic field ^ 2 \\\\ & + & 2\\left^2 -\\frac12\\chi a(\\mathbf n\\cdot)^2,\\ ] ] has the linearized form where \\right\\}+ \\\\ n 0\\times\\left\\right\\ } + \\chi a(\\mathbf n\\cdot),\\ ] ] , , and are the splay , twist , and bend frank elastic constants , correspondingly . the stress tensor can be represented as a sum of reactive and viscous ( dissipative ) contributions , the linearized form of the reactive part is the linearized viscous stress tensor of incompressible nematic is the quantities , , , , and can be expressed through more commonly used leslie viscosity coefficients . note that equating recovers the viscous stress tensor of the isotropic incompressible fluid ( last term in eq .  ) . the aim of this section is to construct the dispersion relation for the surface waves on the basis of the model set up above . we consider a surface wave with frequency and wavevector propagating along axis , and solve force balance equation , eq .  , and torque balance equation , eq .  using linearized form of the hydrodynamic equations written in section . in order to linearize the hydrodynamic equations , we represent pressure and the nematic director , where is the position in space , is time , in form where and are the deviations of pressure and director from their equilibrium values and , correspondingly . the velocity is itself the deviation from zero equilibrium velocity . homeotropic anchoring corresponds to for small deviations from the equilibrium , we shall use the hydrodynamic equations linearized in , , and . we shall assume these quantities to be independent of the coordinate  and vanish at . the magnetic field can be also represented as , where is the equilibrium value , and the deviation can be found from the linearized form of the maxwell equations  ,  . the terms in the final equations , containing , are of higher order than linear , so we shall use only the equilibrium value , and skip the ` 0 ' subscript , so that . substituting the interfacial free energy density  into eqs  ,  ,  , and  , we find the contributions up to the first order in ( and its derivatives ) and into surface tension bending moment tensor \\mathbf i s -\\bar\\kappa\\mathbf b,\\ ] ] tangential component of the capillary vector and tangential surface molecular field + \\nabla s\\cdot\\left(\\bar\\kappa\\mathbf b\\right).\\ ] ] the non -

diagonal , and the dispersion relation ( eq .  ) is equivalent to a pair of relations for and directions : where is the determinant of the matrix of coefficients for the equations  ,  and  , and is the determinant of the matrix of coefficients for the equations  and  . the explicit form of the dispersion relations is presented in appendix and can be readily used for the numerical analysis of surface modes . in this section the dispersion equation , which is presented in appendix , is solved numerically , and surface modes of different types are analyzed . for simplicity , we assume the density of the isotropic liquid , , to be small enough to be neglected ( e.g. nematic surfactant air interface ) . we also assume that the magnetic field is absent . the surface modes can be easily classified at low wavevectors . expansion of the dispersion relation in powers of the wavevector is a straightforward exercise in algebra , and the resulting modes are described below . firstly , there is a transverse capillary mode , which has the dispersion law similar to that in the case of an isotropic liquid - liquid interface : the principal contribution to this mode at large wavelengths arises due to the restoring influence of surface tension , and the predominant motion is in the direction normal to the interface  . the differences from the isotropic case , related to anisotropy of viscous dissipation in the nematic , appear in higher orders in . the dilatational ( or compressional ) mode with predominant motion in the direction along wave propagation  arises in presence of surfactant layer due to the restoring force provided by the dilatational elastic modulus . the dispersion law for this mode can be written as ^{1/3 } + o\\left(q^{4/3}\\right),\\ ] ] where the miesowicz viscosity is given by the difference from the dispersion law for the dilatational mode in the case of a surfactant film at the interface between isotropic fluids , given by arises due to anisotropy of viscous dissipation in nematic . a new mode , specific to the nematic , is driven by relaxation of the director field to equilibrium due to anchoring at the interface and has the disperion law such relaxation is present even in absence of motion of the interface ( e.g. when the interface is solid ) , so that does not vanish at . for nematic - isotropic interfaces , the corresponding motion of the interface is induced by backflow effects . finally , behavior of the in - plane shear mode , with motion in -direction , is also governed by relaxation of the nematic director due to anchoring . the corresponding dispersion law appears to be different from the isotropic case , where the damping of the in - plane shear mode in absence of anchoring is governed by the surface viscosity . gravity , so far neglected in our analysis , becomes important at wavevectors and can be taken into account by adding the hydrostatic pressure term to eq .  , which corresponds to the additional contribution to the vertical component of the force , eq .  . the resulting dispersion law for transversal mode is given by expression which describes well - known gravity waves . in the opposite case of large wavevectors , the curvature energy becomes important . analysis of eqs  and  yields the characteristic values of and below which one can neglect in the dispersion relation the terms containing bending rigidity and its derivatives with respect to surfactant concentration , given by . usually , and the range of in which both gravity and curvature contributions become small , given by is rather wide . for typical values kg / m , m / s , j / m , j , the equation  reads , which includes the range of wavevectors typically probed by surface light scattering experiments . to obtain the dispersion laws for surface modes at larger values of the wavevector , the dispersion equation must be solved numerically . the numerical solution presented below uses the following typical values of the material parameters when it is not indicated otherwise . for the nematic liquid crystal we use the parameters of 4--pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl ( 5cb ) at 26c : the density kg / m , the elastic constants n , n , n , the leslie viscosities kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) . the viscosity coefficient used in the present paper can be calculated from the leslie equations and equal kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) , kg/(ms ) , . we use the value of the bending rigidity j which is typical for surfactant layers . for other parameters we use the following typical values : kg / s , , n / m , n / m , j / m , j / m . dispersion law for different surface modes in absence of gravity , obtained by solution of the dispersion relation  with the values of the parameters given in the text . numbers 1 , 2 , 3 denote transverse , dilatational , and nematic director relaxation modes , correspondingly . prime and double prime denote real ( solid line ) and imaginary ( dashed line ) parts of , correspondingly . ] the dispersion law for different surface modes in absence of gravity , obtained by solution of the dispersion relation  with the values of the parameters given above , is presented in figure . at low the dispersion of for modes 1 , 2 , 3 , as denoted figure , is in good agreement with approximate formulas  ,  , and  , correspondingly . the noticeable discrepancy in behavior of capillary and dilatational modes appears at , and the damping of surface waves becomes large at larger , which is qualitatively similar to the case of the interface between isotropic liquids . the results presented in figure suggest that in the typical range of probed by surface light scattering experiments  , the approximate expressions  ,  do not describe well the dispersion curves , and accurate solution of the dispersion equation should be used instead . dispersion law for different surface modes in presence of gravity m / s , obtained by solution of the dispersion relation  with the values of the parameters given in the text . numbers 1 , 2 , 3 denote transverse , dilatational , and nematic director relaxation modes , correspondingly . prime and double prime denote real ( solid line ) and imaginary ( dashed line ) parts of , correspondingly . vertical dotted line corresponds to the value of given by eq .  . ] figure presents the dispersion law for different surface modes obtained by solution of the dispersion relation  in presence of gravity m / s . in agreement with the discussion above , the influence of gravity on the dispersion laws is small at , where is given by eq .  . dependence of the real ( solid line ) and imaginary ( dashed line ) parts of the frequency of the mode 1 ( as defined on figure ) upon the bending rigidity , calculated at in absence of gravity . vertical line corresponds to the value of that satisfies eq .  . ] if the bending rigidity is large , its influence becomes noticeable , as it is demonstrated in figure . for , typical for surfactant films , the value of , given by eq .  , corresponds to wavelength close to atomic scales , and curvature energy can be neglected in typical surface light scattering experiments , in agreement with the discussion above . dependence of the real ( solid line ) and imaginary ( dashed line ) parts of the frequency of the mode 3 ( as defined on figure ) , normalized by ( see eq .  ) , upon the anchoring strength , calculated at in absence of gravity . ] dependence of the real ( solid line ) and imaginary ( dashed line ) parts of the frequency of the in - plane shear mode , normalized by ( see eq .  ) , upon the anchoring strength , calculated at in absence of gravity . ] the dispersion law for the modes governed by relaxation of the nematic director field in and directions due to anchoring of the nematic director at the interface , obtained by numerical solution of the dispersion equation with the values of the parameters given above , are well described by the equations  and  . however , as the anchoring strength becomes smaller , other mechanisms start to take over , as demonstrated in figures and . in this section we discuss how the surface modes described in section are altered in presence of the external magnetic field directed normally to the surface ( along axis ) . the external magnetic field effectively acts on the nematic molecules as an additional molecular field ( see eq .  ) , and the primary counteracting mechanism is provided by orientational shear relaxation . thus we may expect the influence of the magnetic field become noticeable at dependence of the real ( solid lines ) and imaginary ( dashed lines ) parts of the frequencies of the modes 1 and 2 ( as defined on figure ) upon the magnetic field , calculated at in absence of gravity . vertical dotted line corresponds to ( see eq .  ) . ] the results of the numerical solution of the dispersion equation in presence of magnetic field , presented in figure , confirm that noticeable change in dispersion of capillary and dilatational modes arises only around the value of the field given by eq .  . the change due to magnetic field in modes governed by anchoring is found to be negligibly small . at low the dispersion of a capillary mode in strong magnetic field is different from the law  and is given by the frequency of this mode becomes sensitive to the anchoring properties of the interface , because the nematic director tends to be oriented along the field rather than to be advected with the nematic liquid . the practical use of this effect is , however , limited , because at short wavelengths extremely large magnetic field is required , and at long wavelengths gravity becomes dominating ( eq .  . in principle , magnetic field can also influence surface waves through change in the properties of the interface ( e.g. surface tension ) due to the magnetization of the surfactant . separate study is required to estimate the magnitude of this effect . we have obtained the dispersion relation for the surface waves at a surfactant - laden nematic isotropic interface for the case when the surfactant film induces homeotropic ( normal to the surface ) orientation of the director , and the surfactant film is in the isotropic two - dimensional fluid phase . we have analyzed the dispersion law of different surface modes analytically in long wavelength limit , and numerically in broader range of wave vectors , using typical values of the material parameters . at long wavelengths the dispersion of capillary , dilatational ( or compression ) , in - plane shear , and director relaxation modes is described by equations  ( or  ) ,  ,  , and  , correspondingly . at smaller wavelength , the solution of the full dispersion relation should be used . gravity influences the transversal mode at small wavevectors ( eq .  ) , and curvature energy of surfactant can be neglected if wavevector is not too large ( eq .  ) . for all modes , the influence of the external magnetic field directed normally to the interface is small . the influence of the magnetic field should be more pronounced if the direction of the field does not coincide with equilibrium nematic director . in this case the dispersion law for surface modes may be expected to be quantitatively different due to anisotropy of viscous dissipation in nematic , and different anchoring energy . the results of the present paper can be readily extended to the case of arbitrary direction of the external field and to other types of nematic anchoring . other possible developments , which may increase the range of accessible systems and conditions , is the extension of the results to wider range of the states of the surfactant film , and the study of the effects which may be caused by the phase transitions in the surfactant film and bulk liquid crystal . dependence of the dispersion waves upon the parameters of the interface suggests the surface light scattering on a surfactant - laden nematic - isotropic interface as a potential method for determining of the properties of surfactant - laden nematic - isotropic interfaces , and as a possible candidate for a chemical or biological sensing technique . i thank prof . c. m. care for fruitful discussion of the results , and prof . p. d. i. fletcher for the discussion about surfactant -

{"article": "one of the most interesting topic of quantum physics in recent days is the characterization of universal properties of bosonic many - body system in the unitary regime . by using the feshbach resonance the two - body scattering length is tuned to very large values . the unitary regime is characterized by simple universal laws . for weakly interacting dilute bose gas , the gas like state becomes unstable as increases . however the efimov effect in quantum three - body systems leads to different concept of universality . efimov effect appears in the three - body level ( =3 ) where the attractive two - body interaction is such that the scattering length is much larger than the range of the interaction . under such condition , a series of weakly bound and spatially extended states of efimov character appears in the system . although the efimov character and ultracold behaviour of fermi gas is well understood , the exhaustive study of bosonic system with large scattering length are few . helium trimer is a well studied quantum three - body system in this direction , its first excited state is theoretically claimed as of efimov state , however no experimental observation is still reported . whereas the recent experimental observations of efimov phenomena in ultracold gases has drawn interest in the study of universality in few - body quantum systems but the extension of efimov physics for larger system  is not straightforward . there are several studies in this direction which predicted the universality of the system . though predictions and conclusions made in these works are qualitatively similar quantitative differences exist . this necessitates further study of universal properties of bosonic cluster state having efimov character . + in this work we consider few - bosonic clusters of rb atoms interacting with van der waals interaction . our motivation also comes from recent experiments of weakly bound molecules created from ultracold bose gas . utilizing the feshbach resonance the effective interatomic interaction can be essentially tuned to any desired value . for weakly interacting dilute systems , the efimov state appears at unitary  . our motivation is to study the near threshold behaviour of weakly bound three - dimensional clusters . to characterize this delicate system we prescribe two - body correlated basis function for the many - body cluster interacting through shape - dependent two - body van der waals potential . we expect that our present study will explore the generic behaviour of three - dimensional bosonic cluster near the unitary . the usage of realistic potential with a short range repulsive core and long - range attractive tail may give qualitative conclusion as before but different quantitative behaviours are expected . the paper is organized as follows . in sec . ii we discuss the many - body hamiltonian and numerical calculation . iii considers the results and exhibit the signature of universal cluster states with efimov character . iv concludes with a summary . we approximately solve the many - body schrdinger equation by potential harmonic expansion method ( phem ) . we have successfully applied phem to study different properties of bose einstein condensate and atomic clusters . the method has been described in detail in our earlier works . we briefly describe the method below for interested readers . we consider a system of rb atoms , each of mass and interacting via two - body potential . the hamiltonian of the system is given by here is the two - body potential and is the position vector of the th particle . it is usual practice to decompose the motion of a many - body system into the motion of the center of mass where the center of mass coordinate is and the relative motion of the particles in center of mass frame . for atomic clusters , the center of mass behaves like a free particle in laboratory frame and we set its energy zero . hence , we can eliminate the center of mass motion by using standard jacobi coordinates , defined as and obtain the hamiltonian for the relative motion of the atoms here is the sum of all pair - wise interactions expressed in terms of jacobi coordinates . the hyperspherical harmonic expansion method ( hhem ) is an ab - initio complete many - body approach and includes all possible correlations . the hyperspherical variables are constituted by the hyperradius and hyperangular variables which are comprised of spherical polar angles associated with jacobi vectors and hyperangles given by their lengths . however the calculation of potential matrix elements of all pairwise potentials becomes a formidable task and the convergence rate of the hyperspherical harmonic expansion becomes extremely slow for , due to rapidly increasing degeneracy of the basis . thus hhem is not suitable for the description of large diffuse atomic clusters . but for a diffuse cluster like rb - cluster , only two - body correlation and pairwise interaction are important . therefore we can decompose the total wave function into two - body faddeev component for the interacting pair as it is important to note that is a function of two - body separation  and the global only . therefore for each of the interacting pair of a particle system , the active degrees of freedom is effectively reduced to only four , viz . , and and the remaining irrelevant degrees of freedom are frozen . since is decomposed into all possible interacting pair faddeev components , all two - body correlations are included . thus the physical picture for a given faddeev component is that when two particles interact , the rest of the particles behave as inert spectators.thus the effect of two - body correlation comes through the two - body interaction in the expansion basis . it is to be noted that is symmetric under the exchange operator for bosonic atoms and satisfy the faddeev equation \\phi {ij } = -v( {ij})\\sum {kl > k}^{n}\\phi {kl } \\ ] ] where is the total kinetic energy operator . applying the operator on both sides of eq .  , we get back the original schrdinger equation . since we assume that when  pair interacts the rest of the bosons are inert spectators , the total hyperangular momentum and the orbital angular momentum of the whole system is contributed by the interacting pair only . next the th faddeev component is expanded in the set of potential harmonics ( ph ) ( which is a subset of hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) basis and sufficient for the expansion of ) appropriate for the  partition as denotes the full set of hyperangles in the -dimensional space corresponding to the interacting pair and is called the ph . it has an analytic expression : is the hh of order zero in the dimensional space spanned by jacobi vectors ; is the hyperangle between the -th jacobi vector and the hyperradius and is given by = . for the remaining noninteracting bosons we define hyperradius as such that . the set of quantum numbers of hh is now reduced to only as for the non - interacting pair and for the interacting pair , and . thus the dimensional schrdinger equation reduces effectively to a four dimensional equation with the relevant set of quantum numbers : energy , orbital angular momentum quantum number , azimuthal quantum number and grand orbital quantum number for any . substituting eq .  in eq .  and projecting on a particular ph , a set of coupled differential equation for the partial wave is obtained u {kl}(r ) + }}f {kl}v {kk^{\\prime}}(r ) f {k^{\\prime}l } u {k^{\\prime}l}(r ) = 0&\\\\ \\ ] ] + where , , and . + is a constant and represents the overlap of the ph for interacting partition with the sum of phs corresponding to all partitions . the potential matrix element is given by we do not require the additional short - range correlation function as mentioned in ref . it is already pointed out that the universal properties of ultracold dilute atomic gas in the unitary regime is characterized when the two - body scattering length is tuned to very large values by using the feshbach resonance . although the unitary fermi gas has been largely investigated both experimentally and theoretically , the bosonic unitary regime is a formidable challenge in the many - body theories . even though the range of the interaction is small compared with the particle separation , interatomic correlations are very important and the standard mean - field theories are inadequate . + the interaction strength of sufficiently dilute atomic cloud is parameterized by a single parameter - the -wave scattering length . however for our present study to explore the generic behaviour near the unitary , we consider the van der waals potential characterized by two parameters : the cutoff radius of the repulsive hard core and the strength of the long - range tail . thus keeping fixed , it is possible to tune the value of . solving the two - body schrdinger equation it is possible to calculate the scattering length for each choice of . we solve the zero - energy two - body schrdinger equation for the two - body wave function as where for and for . the asymptotic form of is , is the normalization constant . the solution of two - body equation shows that the value of changes from negative to positive passing through an infinite discontinuity . in fig . , we plot the zero - energy scattering length as a function of . at each discontinuity , one extra node in the two - body wave function appears which corresponds to one extra two - body bound state . however for our present study we fix such that it corresponds to zero node in the two - body wave function . we impose the constraint just to avoid the formation of the molecules , otherwise when sufficiently increases , the rate of three - body collisions will increase which deplete the density by forming molecules . + with the above set of parameters we solve the set of coupled differential equations ( cdes ) by hyperspherical adiabatic approximation ( haa ) . in haa , we assume the hyperradial motion is slow compared to the hyperangular motion . thus the solution of the hyperangular motion is obtained by diagonalizing the potential matrix including the diagonal hypercentrifugal repulsion for a fixed value of . the cde is then decoupled approximately into a single uncoupled differential equation \\zeta {0}(r)=0\\hspace*{.1 cm } , \\ ] ] which is known as extreme adiabatic approximation ( eaa ) and the lowest eigenvalue is the effective potential in which the hyperradial motion takes place . the above equation is solved to obtain the energy and wave function with appropriate boundary conditions on . + in fig . , we plot the calculated bosonic cluster ground state energies in the negative scattering length near the unitary for different cluster sizes with = 3,4,5,6,7 as a function of the scattering length which represents the universal properties of the bosonic cluster energy at large . it is to be noted that the effective interaction of the bosonic cluster is determined by . with increase in particle number , the number of interacting pair also increases and the energy becomes more negative as expected . for two particles the infinite scattering length corresponds to a bound state at zero energy . for three particles the efimov effect appears at or = 0 , infinitely many three - body bound states with smaller binding energy and larger radii will appear . moving in the opposite by decreasing the attraction , these states cease to be bound one by one . we have calculated the spectrum of bosonic clusters and in fig . we plot as a function of the state number of the negative energy states . the radii of efimov states as a function of state number is shown in fig . . , we observe that for each of the -body systems there is a series of bound states with exceedingly small energies . it is seen that these series of states show exponential dependence upon the state number as . the exponential fits give the numbers as = 0.448 , = 0.278 , = 0.198 , = 0.149 . whereas in fig . , we observe that the spatial extension of efimov states is much larger than the interaction range and the r. m. s. radii of efimov states are well reproduced with the exponential where the fitted parameters are = 0.18 , = 0.12 , = 0.09 and = 0.068 . the ratio = 0.41 for = 4 , 0.43 for = 5 , 0.46 for = 6 and 0.47 for = 7 , is close to the value of 0.5 as reported in ref . for trapped bosons . finally we analyse the structural properties of the cluster states by calculating the pair - correlation function which determines the probability of finding the pair of particles at a relative separation . presents the pair correlation function for at unitarity . is considered as a more effective quantity in the description of structural properties as the interatomic interaction plays a crucial role . when atoms try to form clusters , due to the attractive part of van der waals interaction , the short range hard core repulsion has the effect of repulsion , thus is zero for smaller than the hard core radius . we calculate by where is the many - body wave function and the integral over the hypervolume excludes the integration over . the position of the maximum is shifted to larger with increase in and peak height reduces . however we do not observe any structure in the correlation function . it says that the extremely diffuse cluster behaves just like diffuse liquid blob as observed in earlier work . it is already mentioned that while the universal behaviours of the trimer are quite well understood , much less is known about the larger systems . in this context the investigation of correlations between energies of three and four - particle systems is indeed required . the earlier studies in this direction are mainly focused on the tjon line which refers to the approximately linear correlation between the energies of three - nucleon and four - nucleon systems . it is expected that the bosonic cluster energy close to the unitarity , for different cluster states should follow the generalized tjon line . it says that the energies are linearly correlated to each other and a two - parameter relation is maintained . in fig . , we present the energy ratio as a function of for different cluster sizes = 4,5,6 . solid lines show linear fits of the form . the fitting parameters are summarized in table . we refer the approximate linear fitting of the energy ratios of clusters as the generalized tjon line . we observe that the values of the fitting parameters gradually decreases with increasing and this is consistent with earlier finding . .values of fitting parameters of tjon line . this definitely opens the possibilities of future investigations of how the behaviour of the generalized tjon lines are related in the description of the universal properties of diffuse bosonic clusters . cc + ( a ) & + & + ( b ) & + + ( c ) & + the physics of weakly bound few - body systems and their universal behaviour near the unitary is a challenging research area in recent days . the recent experimental observation of efimov phenomena in ultracold bose gases has renewed the interest in universal few - body physics . the theoretical study of three - dimensional bosonic cluster with more than three particles is also challenging and the numerical treatment becomes complicated with . the cluster is weakly bound as the kinetic and potential energy nearly cancel . it needs to include interatomic correlation . in the present study we utilize two - body correlated basis function for the study of -boson systems . use of realistic van der waals potential presents the actual feature of such delicate systems . we calculate the energy spectrum of -body cluster with upto 7 atoms . at large scattering length , which is much larger than the range of interaction , the ground state energy of -body cluster shows universal behaviour . next , to exhibit the efimov like character of the energy states we present the exponential dependence on the state number . we also calculate the r.m.s radii of the spatially extended systems and also shows their exponential dependence on the state number . calculation of two -

{"article": "the visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information has never been identified conclusively . folklore has it that feynman mentioned this notion in casual conversations ( circa 1985 ) , but to this author s knowledge there did not exist concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates till the mid 1990s . encoding information in spin may have certain advantages . first , there is the possibility of lower power dissipation in switching logic gates . in charge based devices , such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors , switching between logic 0 and logic 1 is accomplished by moving charges into and out of the transistor channel . motion of charges is induced by creating a potential gradient ( or electric field ) . the associated potential energy is ultimately dissipated as heat and irretrievably lost . in the case of spin , we do not have to move charges . in order to switch a bit from 0 to 1 , or vice versa , we merely have to toggle the spin . this may require much less energy . second , spin does not couple easily to stray electric fields ( unless there is strong spin - orbit interaction in the host material ) . therefore , spin is likely to be relatively immune to noise . finally , it is possible that spin devices may be faster . if we do not have to move electrons around , we will not be limited by the transit time of charges . instead , we will be limited by the spin flip time , which could be smaller . in 1994 , we proposed a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate ( nand ) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field . by `` three spins '' , we mean the spin orientations of three conduction band electrons , each confined in a semiconductor quantum dot . the system is shown schematically in fig . exchange interaction is allowed only between nearest neighbor spins ( second nearest neighbor interaction is considered too weak to have any effect ) . because of the magnetic field , the spin orientation in any quantum dot becomes a binary variable . the spin polarization is either along the magnetic field , or opposite to the field . to understand this , consider the hamiltonian of an isolated dot : where is the unperturbed hamiltonian in the absence of the magnetic field , is the magnetic field , is the land g - factor of the quantum dot material , is the bohr magneton , and is the pauli spin matrix . if the magnetic field is directed along the z - direction , then diagonalizing the above hamiltonian yields the eigenspinors ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) which are + z and -z polarized spins . therefore , the spin orientation is a binary variable ; it is either parallel or anti - parallel to the applied magnetic field . in the presence of exchange interaction between two electrons confined to two separate potentials ( such as two different quantum dots ) , the anti - ferromagnetic ordering , or the singlet state , ( i.e. two neighboring spins are anti - parallel ) is preferred over the ferromagnetic ordering , or triplet state ( two spins are parallel ) . we will assume that the tendency to preserve this anti - ferromagnetic ordering is stronger than the tendency for all spins to line up along the magnetic field . this merely requires that the exchange splitting energy ( energy difference between triplet and singlet states ) exceed the zeeman splitting energy . we ensure this by reducing the potential barrier between neighboring dots to enhance the exchange , while at the same time , making the magnetic field sufficiently weak to reduce the zeeman energy . under this scenario , the ground state of the array has the spin configuration shown in fig . we will call `` upspin '' the spin orientation directed along the magnetic field and `` downspin '' the opposite orientation . we encode logic 1 in the upspin state . furthermore , we will consider the two edge dots in fig . 1(a ) as input ports to a logic gate , and the middle dot as the output port . it is obvious that when the two inputs are logic 1 , the output will be logic 0 when the system reaches ground state ( anti - ferromagnetic ordering ) . next , consider the situation when the two inputs are logic 0 ( see fig . the output must be logic 1 in order to conform to the anti - ferromagnetic ordering . however , there is a subtle issue . 1(b ) is actually not the ground state of the system , fig . this is because of the weak magnetic field . the difference between fig . 1(a ) and fig . 1(b ) is that in the former case , two spins are aligned parallel to the magnetic field , while in the latter , two spins are aligned anti - parallel to the magnetic field . therefore , if the system is left in the state of fig . 1(b ) , it must ultimately decay to the state in fig . 1(a ) , according to the laws of thermodynamics . but that may take a very long time because of three reasons . first , the system must emit some energy carrying entity to decay . this entity is most likely a phonon . however , phonon emissions in quantum dots are suppressed by the `` phonon bottleneck '' effect . second , phonons do not couple easily to spin unless we have a strongly pyroelectric material as the host . finally , if spins flip one at a time ( all three spins flipping simultaneously is very unlikely ) , then in order to access the state in fig 1(a ) , the state in fig . 1(b ) will have to go through a state where two neighboring spins will be parallel . such a state is much higher in energy than either fig . 1(a ) or fig . therefore , fig . 1(a ) and fig . 1(b ) are separated by an energy barrier , making fig . 1(b ) a long lived metastable state . as long as the input bit rate is high enough so that inputs change much more rapidly than the time it takes for the metastable state to decay to the global ground state of fig . 1(a ) , we need not worry about this issue . what happens if one of the inputs is logic 1 , and the other is logic 0 as shown in fig . 1(c ) ? here the magnetic field comes in handy to break the tie . in this case , logic 1 is preferred as the output since the all other things being equal , a spin would prefer to line up parallel to the magnetic field , rather than anti - parallel . thus , when either input is logic 0 , the ouput is logic 1 . we have realized the truth table in table 1 . .truth table of a spintronic nand gate the reader will recognize that this is the truth table of a nand gate , which is one of two universal boolean logic gates . since we can realize a nand , we can realize any arbitrary boolean logic circuit ( combinational or sequential ) by connecting nand gates . a number of different logic devices ( half adders , flip - flops , etc . ) were designed and illustrated in ref . . these devices have been extensively studied by others using time independent simulations . the time - independent simulations address the steady state behaviors and therefore do not directly reveal a serious problem with these devices that was already recognized in ref . . in the following section , we explain this problem . at the time these logic gates were proposed , it was also realized that they have a severe shortcoming that precludes their use in pipelined architectures . to understand the nature of the problem , consider three inverters ( not gates ) in series . a single not gate is the simplest device ; it is realized by two exchange coupled spins , one of which is the input and the other is the output . because of the anti - ferromagnetic ordering , the output is always the logic complement of the input . 2(a ) shows three conventional inverters in series and fig . 2(b ) shows the corresponding spintronic realization . the input to the first inverter is logic 1 and the output of the last inverter is logic 0 , as it should be . but now , let us suddenly change the input at the first inverter to logic 0 at time = 0 . the situation at time = 0 + is shown in fig . we expect that ultimately the output of the last inverter will become logic 1 . unfortunately , this can not happen . in fig . 2(c ) , the second spin from the left finds its left neighbor asking it to flip ( because of the exchange interaction that enforces anti - ferromagnetic ordering between two neighboring spins ) while its right neighbor is asking it to stay put because of the same exchange interaction . both influences from the left and from the right are exactly equally strong and the second cell is stuck in a logic indeterminate state that it can not get out of . rolf landauer later termed it a metastable state that prevents decay to the desired ground state . in fact , if we take the external magnetic field into account , then there is a preference for the second cell to actually not flip in response to the input since there is a slight preference for the upspin state because of the external magnetic field . in this case , the logic signal can not propagate from the input to the output and the circuit simply does not work ! similar situations were examined in ref . the real problem is that exchange interaction is bidirectional which can not ensure unidirectional flow of logic signal from the input to the output of the logic device . this unidirectionality is a required attribute of any logic device ( for the five necessary requirements of a classical logic device , see ref . ) . we can think of desperate measures to enforce the unidirectionality . for example , we can claim that if we hold the input at the first inverter ( leftmost cell in fig . 2(c ) ) to logic 0 , and do not let go , then the second cell which is equally likely to follow its left neighbor and right neighbor , will have no option but to ultimately follow its left neighbor since it is adamant and persistent ( we are not letting go of the input ) . this will happen in spite of the magnetic field since the exchange energy is larger than the zeeman splitting . in this case , we are trying to enforce unidirectionality via the input signal itself ( note that the input device does indeed break the inversion symmetry of the system in fig . this possible remedy was studied theoretically in ref . which reached the conclusion that it does not always work . in fact , the process of logic signal propagation under this scenario is inefficient thermally assisted random walk and the final logic state , if reached , can be destroyed by thermal fluctuations . the idea of using the input device to enforce unidirectionality was also implicitly used in the experiment of ref . . while this may work for a few cells ( as it did in ref . ) , it will obviously not work for a large number of cells since the influence of the input decays with increasing distance from the input . ultimately , the remote cells that are far from the input , will not feel the input s effect and remain stuck in metastable states , producing wrong answers to simple logic problems . in ref . , one solution that was offered to break this impasse was to progressively increase the distance between cells . this makes the influence of the left neighbor always stronger than that of the right neighbor since the strength of the exchange interaction has an exponential dependence on the separation between neighboring cells . this is not an elegant solution since ultimately the exchange splitting energy will become smaller than the zeeman splitting energy , at which point the paradigm will no longer work . in 1996 , we proposed a more elegant solution . this was inspired by the realization that in charge coupled device ( ccd ) arrays , there is no inherent unidirectionality , yet charge is made to propagate from one device to the next unidirectionally . this is achieved by clocking . we mentioned that unidirectionality can be imposed in time or space and clocking imposes unidirectionality in time . however , a cursory examination revealed that normal clocking will not work in our case . say , we put gate pads on the barriers between neighboring cells . initially , all the the barriers are high and opaque so that there is no overlap between the wavefunctions of adjacent electrons and hence no exchange interaction between neighboring spins . now , we lower the first barrier by applying a positive potential to gate 1 as shown in fig . this allows the wavefunctions of electrons on either side of the gate pad to leak out into the barrier , overlap . and cause an exchange interaction . exchange causes the second spin to assume a polarization anti - parallel to the input spin orientation since the singlet state is lower in energy than the triplet . in other words , the second cell switches . at this point , if we let go of the input , raise the first barrier back up , and lower the second barrier by applying a positive potential to gate 2 , then either the third cell switches in response to the second ( which is shown in the upper branch ) , or the second cell switches in response to the third ( which is shown in the lower branch ) . the upper branch is the desired state , but it is equally likely that the lower branch will result since both branches obey the ant - ferromagnetic ordering between the two exchange coupled cells ( cell 2 and 3 ) . therefore , a simple sequential clock will not work . what is required is that both gate 1 and gate 2 have positive potentials while the input is applied . now the first three cells assume the correct polarizations as shown in fig . then , the input is removed , gate 1 is returned to zero potential and positive potentials are applied to gates 2 and 3 . this causes the first four cells to assume the correct polarization , and so on . this situation is shown in fig . 2(f ) and is the desired configuration . thus by lowering two adjacent barriers pairwise at the same time , we can propagate the input state through a linear array . in other words , we will need a three - phase clock , a single phase will not work . the three clock pulse trains for a three - phase clock are shown in fig . each train is phase shifted from the previous one by radians . such a situation is not unusual since charge coupled device arrays also need a multi - phase clock ( push clock , drop clock ) to work . while , multi - phase clocking can make these devices work , it is hardly an attractive solution since one needs to fabricate gate pads between every two cells . the separation between the cells may need to be 5 nm in order to have sufficient exchange coupling . aligning a gate pad to within a space of 5 nm is a major lithography challenge . furthermore , the gate potentials are lowered and raised by moving charges into and out of the gate pads , leading to considerable energy dissipation that completely negates the advantage of using spins . therefore , these devices present interesting physics , but at this time , do not appear to be serious candidates for practical applications . so far , we have discussed the use of spin in classical irreversible logic gates . these logic gates dissipate a minimum of amount of energy per bit flip . let us assume that we can make quantum dots with a density of 10 . quantum dots self assembled by electrochemical techniques in our own lab ( and in many other labs ) can achieve this density today . we show a raw atomic force micrograph of quantum dots self assembled in our lab in fig . 3 . the dark areas are the dots and the surrounding light areas are the barriers . the dot diameter in this micrograph is 50 nm and the dot density is close to 10 . by using slightly different synthesis conditions , we can actually achieve densities exceeding 10 . let us now assume that we can flip the spin in a quantum dot in 1 psec . then the minimum power that will be dissipated per unit area will exceed /(1 psec ) = 3 kw/ ( actually most of the power will be dissipated in the clock cycles , which we have ignored ) . this dissipation is at least 30 times more than what the pentium iv chip dissipates . although removal of 1 kw/ of heat from a chip was demonstrated almost two decades ago , removing 3 kw/ from a chip is still a major challenge in heat sinking . the obvious way to overcome ( or , rather , circumvent ) this challenge is to develop reversible logic gates that are not constrained by the landauer barrier . in 1996 , we devised a logically and physically reversible quantum inverter using two exchange coupled spins . this device is very similar to the single electron parametron idea and can be viewed as a single spin parametron . since either spin could exist in a coherent superposition of two orthogonal spin states ( call them `` upspin '' and `` downspin '' states ) , this would also be a `` qubit '' . later , loss and divincenzo devised a universal quantum gate using two exchange coupled spins in two closely spaced quantum dots . recently , experimental demonstration of coherent transfer of electron spins between quantum dots coupled by conjugated molecules has been demonstrated , opening up real possibilities in this area . the idea of using a single electron or nuclear spin to encode a qubit and then utilizing this to realize a universal quantum gate , has taken hold . the motivation for this is the realization that spin coherence times in solids is much larger than charge coherence time . charge coherence times in semiconductors tend to saturate to about 1 nsec as the temperature is lowered . this is presumably due to coupling to zero point motion of phonons which can not be eliminated by lowering temperature . on the other hand , electron spin coherence times of 100 nsec in gaas at 5 k has already been reported and much higher coherence times are expected for nuclear spins in silicon . therefore , spin is obviously the preferred vehicle to encode qubits in solids . using spin to carry out all optical quantum computing has also appeared as a viable and intriguing idea . the advantage of the all - optical scheme over the electronic scheme is that we do not have to read single electron spins electrically to read a qubit . electrical read out is extremely difficult , although some schemes have been proposed for this purpose . recently , some experimental progress has been made in this direction , but reading a single qubit in the solid state still remains elusive , . the difficult part is that electrical read out requires making contacts to individual quantum dots , which is an engineering challenge . in contrast , optical read out does not require contacts . the qubit is read out using a quantum jump technique which requires monitoring the fluorescence from a quantum dot . recently , it has been verified experimentally that the spin state of an electron in a quantum dot can be read by circularly polarized light . therefore , optical read out appears to be a more practical approach . in this article we have provided a brief history of the use of single electron spin in computing . we have indicated where and why spin may have an advantage over charge in implementing the type of devices and architectures discussed here . s. bandyopadhyay and v. p. roychowdhury , proceedings of the international conference on superlattices and microstructures , liege , belgium , 1996 , also in superlat . 3 , 411416 ( 1997 ) . t. calarco , a. datta , p. fedichev , e. pazy and p. zoller , phys . rev . a , vol . 68 , no . 1 , 012310 -

{"article": "circumstellar material holds clues about the mass - loss history of massive stars . indeed , as the winds interact with the interstellar medium ( wind - blown bubbles , bow shocks ) , they leave a characteristic signature that depends on the wind properties . moreover , the material ejected during short eruptive phases is visible as nebulae around massive stars . the analysis of these features reveals which material was ejected and in which quantity . with the recent reduction in mass - loss rates , these episodes of enhanced mass - loss have gained more attention , as they seem more crucial than ever in the evolution of massive stars . another reason to study the close environment of massive stars is to better understand the evolution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) . indeed , the famous rings of sn1987a may only be understood if one considers the previous mass - loss episodes of the progenitor . morphology is not the only snr parameter which is affected , as the snr dynamics in an homogeneous medium or in winds and circumstellat ejecta is not identical . for its study , the ir provides several key diagnostics . continuum emission in this range is provided by heated dust , which may have a range of temperatures depending of the framework ( very close hot features , large , old , and cool bubbles ) . in addition , ir lines probe the many phases of the material : molecules ( e.g. pahs ) for the neutral material , ionized metals for hii regions , ... this summary of sps5 - part iii examines each case of circumstellar environment in turn , and concludes with the potential offered by current and future facilities . circumstellar structures around bsgs have been predominantely identified as bow shocks around runaway stars . originally discovered with iras ( e.g. van buren & mccray , 1988 , apj , 329 , l93 ) , such structures have also been seen with msx and wise ( peri et al . 2012 ) . a more general survey of bsgs , i.e. not targeting runaway stars , with objects selected from crowther et al . ( 2006 ) and przybilla et al . ( 2010 ) , reveals ir material around six of the 45 targets at 22 m with wise , also mostly in the form of bow shocks ( wachter , in prep ) . several examples of bipolar nebulae around bsgs are also known ( e.g. sher 25 , smartt et al . 2002 ; hd 168625 , smith 2007 ) . however , this material could have also been ejected during an lbv phase , since lbvs can exhibit bsg spectra , and we will therefore concentrate on the bow shocks . emission ( greyscale ) of vela x-1 with pacs 70 m emission contours shown on top . right : colour composite image of bow shock of bd+43 ( wise 12 m in blue , pacs 70 m in green , and pacs 160 m in red ) . the direction of proper motion is indicated by the arrow in both cases . from cox ( in prep.).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] emission ( greyscale ) of vela x-1 with pacs 70 m emission contours shown on top . right : colour composite image of bow shock of bd+43 ( wise 12 m in blue , pacs 70 m in green , and pacs 160 m in red ) . the direction of proper motion is indicated by the arrow in both cases . from cox ( in prep.).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] runaway stars have large stellar velocities ( above 30kms ) resulting from dynamical interactions in ( dense ) clusters or from a supernova explosion in a binary system . these stars can thus travel at supersonic speeds through the local medium giving rise to `` bow shocks '' as their stellar winds interact with the surrounding medium , which has been previously ionised by stellar photons from the hot star ( weaver 1977 ) . the occurrence of such bow shocks has been shown to depend primarily on the ism conditions ( huthoff & kaper 2002 ) . for example , even a runaway star may travel at subsonic speeds in the tenuous interior of a superbubble , where the sound speed can be as much as 100kms , hence no ( detectable ) bow shock will be produced in that case . the filling factor of ism with kms is 20% and 75% of o - stars have velocities kms , so the expected fraction of o - stars with bow shocks is % . this is remarkably similar to the values derived from iras and wise observations ( noriega - crespo et al . 1997 , peri et al . 2012 ) . once formed , the size , shape and morphology of a bow shock depends on both stellar ( wind kinetic energy and stellar velocity ) and interstellar parameters ( density and temperature ) . in particular the ratio indicates whether or not instabilities are likely to develop ( dgani et al . 1996 ) , and the stand - off distance between the star and the apex of the shock is determined from the pressure balance between the stellar wind and the ism ( see analytical results by wilkin 1996 and simulations by e.g. comeron & kaper 1998 , blondin & koerwer 1998 ) . independent estimates of the wind parameters can thus be inferred from bow shocks , which serves as a useful check for atmosphere models , but the values are sensitive to the ism properties , which are not always known with precision . m of the dust thermal emission obtained by kervella et al . north is up , east to the left , and the field of view is given in the upper right corner of each image . , width=529 ] currently , a small survey with herschel - pacs of 5 runaways with known bow - shocks is ongoing : cam , oph , cma , vela x-1 and bd+43 ( cox et al . , in preparation ) . for vela x-1 , the peak emission of the dust emission is co - spatial with the most prominent h arc seen in the supposed direction of space motion ( fig . ) : it is concluded that the outer shock is radiative , but the inner shock is adiabatic , though some h emission possibly related to ( part of ) the inner termination shock is also detected . from the analysis of its `` puffed - up '' bow shock ( fig . ) , the mass - loss rate of bd+43 ( o4if ) was found to be 10myr : this is very high ( by 2 orders of magnitude ) in view of current mass - loss rate estimates of such stars , but the exact value strongly depends on ism density , which need to be refined . the dust temperature , 45 k , is compatible with heating by stellar photons only , suggesting there is no additional shock - heating of grains . the thickness of a bow shock ( 1 pc ) suggests a mach number close to unity , implying a ism temperature of 10 10 k. circumstellar structures on scales of a few arcseconds or less around rsgs have been revealed through interferometric techniques ( e.g. monnier et al . stencel et al . ( 1988 , 1989 ) reported the iras detection of resolved shells with typical radii of a few arcminutes around rsgs for a significant fraction ( 25% ) of their sample . however , higher resolution spitzer images fail to confirm several of these extended structures ( wachter , in prep ) , indicating that a systematic survey is needed to ascertain the occurrence of large scale circumstellar shells around rsgs . m to 192 m . multitude of molecular lines have been detected . from matsuura et al . ( in prep.).,width=453 ] a few ( famous ) cases have however been studied in depth . one of these is betelgeuse , a cool ( 3600k ) , large ( 700 r ) , rather massive ( 1015 m ) , luminous ( l ) , and nearby ( 150 pc ) star . because of its distance , betelgeuse can be probed on almost all scales , providing a unique panorama of stellar surroundings ( fig . ) . space - based and interferometric instruments ( e.g. hst , iota / ionic and vlti / pionier ) revealed the photosphere , notably the expected non - uniformities due to large convection cells . adaptive optics imaging in the near - ir ( e.g. naco ) and ( radio or ir ) interferometers unveiled the properties of the internal , compact molecular envelope ( 110 r ) . precursors of dust have been found there , as well as an extended `` plume '' reaching 6r and maybe linked to a hot spot on the photosphere . high - res imaging ( e.g. vlt / visir ) shows the envelope at intermediate scales ( 10100 r ) , where the dust forms ( a possible signature of silicates has been found ) . at these small and intermediate scales , betegeuse presents a complex circumstellar envelope ( with knots and filaments ) at all wavelengths , which implies an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the material lost by the star . finally , at the largest scale , ir imagers such as herschel unveil the cool external envelope ( 100 - 10000 r ) , where a bow shock with the ism is detected ( cox et al . 2012 ) . m ( blue ; blue contours ) and 22 m ( red ; yellow contours ) of ws1 , discovered and initially characterized by gvaramadze et al . the contours for each band help illuminate the morphology of the nebular material , which has an overall se - nw elongation , reminiscent of bipolar structure . bottom left : optical photometric monitoring since discovery show both the r and i light curves have brightened by about 1 magnitude over the last year . arrows indicate times when same night spectroscopy were secured . right panel : optical spectroscopic monitoring indicates evolution to cooler temperature with near disappearance of the he i 5876 and 6678 and changes in the line profile . figures from stringfellow et al . ( in preparation).,width=377 ] herschel has also probed the envelope of other red supergiants ( groenewegen et al . turning in particular to the case of vy cma ( matsuura et al . , in prep . ) , the potential of ir spectroscopy is obvious . herschel - spire reveals a rich spectrum , with a dust continuum and hundreds of lines dues to molecules ( one third linked to water , others to co , cs , sio , ... ) , which constrain the envelope s properties . for example , the isotopic ratio c/c is found to be 6.5 , in agreement with observations of other rsgs but at odds with theoretical predictions which are four times higher at least . very strong emission of submm molecular lines can be explained if a temperature gradient is present in the envelope , e.g. because of dust formation at a certain radius . because of their spectacular eruptions , lbvs are the most well - known cases of massive stars with ejecta . it is not yet certain , however , at what stage ( bsg ? after a rsg phase or not ? ) this material is ejected , and how ( multiple events ? ) . lbvs are rare : in the list of clark et al . ( 2005 ) , there are only 12 confirmed and 23 candidate lbvs . ir has played a key role in recent years . the search , through surveys like mipsgal , of round - shaped nebulae with luminous central stars resulted in the discovery of many new nebulae : 62 shells in wachter et al . ( 2010 ) , 115 shells and bipolar nebulae in gvaramadze et al . ( 2010 ) , 416 structures in mizuno et al . many of these nebulae are preferentially detected with spitzer 24 m band , indicating relatively cold material . identifying shell - like structures is only the first step . to ascertain a clbv status , the central object needs to be studied spectroscopically . this was done for many of these new detections ( c.f . , gvaramadze et al . 2010 ; wachter et al . 2010 ; stringfellow et al . 2012a , b , and in preparation ) . the classification does not rely on the presence of a particular line , but rather on the morphological resemblance of the spectra to spectra of known lbvs - while not 100% perfect ( some peculiar o and wr stars display similar features ) , this method has the advantage of being simple and rather robust . a more definitive answer can be provided through photometric and/or spectroscopic monitorings . indeed , as their name indicate , lbvs should be variable . near - simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical ( and ir ) of about a dozen newly identified candidate lbvs has revealed that ws1 ( discovered by gvaramadze et al . 2012 ) is indeed a bona fide lbv , presently displaying what appears to be s dor type variability as shown in fig . ( stringfellow et al . 2012 , in preparation ) . ir is also useful in revealing details of particular objects . for example , a herschel survey of lbvs undertaken at lige yielded as first result a characterization of the surroundings of wray 15 - 751 ( vamvatira - nakou et al . , submitted ) . ir photometry can only be explained if the star evolves at constant luminosity and dust grains are fe - rich . images also revealed the presence of a second shell , about 4 times larger than the previously known one , which most probably results from an older eruptive event . considering both structures , there is about 0.075 m of dust in the system . ionized gas is responsible for several forbidden lines observed in the herschel - pacs range ( fig . ) , which allow a n / o abundance of about 7 times solar and a mass of ionized gas of 12 m ( 20 times that of dust ) , to be derived . dust can be well studied in the ir , so this range may provide clues on where dust come from in galaxies . two examples of such feedback were presented in the session : car and sn1987a . the latter was observed with herschel at 100 - 500 m wavelengths , and 0.4 - 0.7 m of dust was detected - mostly silicates and amorphous carbon ( matsuura et al . it is thought that this dust come from the explosion , but the role played by previous mass - loss episodes , in particular the lbv phase , is not yet clear . for example , about 0.12 m of dust was detected , thanks to 30 m minitao observations , in the famous lbv car . up to 80% of that dust belonged to the torus , hence may not be related to the big 1843 event . only a few percentage ( 4 - 6% ) of wolf - rayet stars displays surrounding nebulosities in the wise survey , and most are found around wn stars ( wachter , in prep ) . the morphological classification scheme of wr nebulae proposed by chu ( 1981 ) has been revised in this meeting by guerrero et al . ( toal et al , in prep . ) using wise ir images and sdss or super cosmos sky survey h images for 35 nebulae associated with wrs . two wise bands were particularly used : the one at 12 m , which encompasses pah lines and lines of low excitation ions , and that at 22 m , to which thermal emission from dust and lines of he i as well as high excitation ions contribute . three phases are defined . in the first one , wr nebulae appear as complete shells or bubbles . it corresponds to the star just entering the wr stage , when its powerful wind sweeps up the previous slow and dense winds ( from e.g. lbv or rsg stages ) . the second phase is the clumpy phase . at that point , the nebulae display knots of gas and dust connected by partial shells and arcs . it corresponds to an age of a few 10yr , when instabilities break down the swept - up shell . the stellar motion through the ism has an impact on the morphology , for example one - sided arc may be sometimes seen . finally , the mixed nebular phase ends the cycle , with no definite morphology nor always a 1-to-1 correspondence between optical and ir images . it corresponds to the last stage , when the circumstellar nebula begins to dissolve into the ism . the close environment of massive stars is the `` missing link '' between the star itself and the large circumstellar features . it plays a key role in understanding the mass - loss , but it is also difficult to probe directly . emission lines arising in the wind and circumstellar material are a classical way to study this region , as well as near - ir excess linked to disk - like features . in this context , be and b stars are targets of choice , and surprises are frequent . for example , graus et al . ( 2012 ) found three new sgb in the smc : they display typical spectra , with forbidden lines , but the line strengths as well as the ir excess appear reduced compared to usual objects of this class . it suggests that either the disks have less material or less dust than usual , or maybe that these stars are transitional objects . another case intriguingly shows the opposite situation : cd displays forbidden lines and appreciable ir excess , but is a main - sequence be star away from any star - forming region ( lee and chen 2009 ) . a possibility may be that this star is in fact a weak b , rather than a classical be . the environment close to the star can also be studied , directly , by means of interferometry , which is usually performed at long wavelengths . most optical / ir interferometric measurements rely on the measurements of `` visibilities '' , which are directly linked to the size of the object . recently , several massive stars , including nine lbvs , were observed with the vlti ( groh et al . , in prep . ) . amongst these , hd316285 ( fig . ) : the recorded visibilities implied a size of 0.002 for the source of continuum radiation , and 0.004 for the source of the br line . a cmfgen fit to the spectrum yields a stellar model with which one can estimate the wind size in ir , and it agrees well with vlti observations . the asymetric shape of the measured differential phases ( red vs blue side ) favors a prolate shape for the rotating star wind , but it could also be explained by clumps or binarity . since the latter imply in time variability , a monitoring will be needed to ascertain the exact nature of the asymmetry . = 0.19 , rather than 0.25 as von zeipel predicted in 1924.,width=377 ] while visibilities provide valuable data , `` real '' images are always more impressive . interferometric instruments such as michigan infrared combiner ( mirc ) and pionier are beginning to provide such data . mirc was the first to image altair ( monnier et al . 2007 ) and several other rapidly rotating stars as shown in fig . it has also imaged circumstellar disks and multi - object systems . for example , the disk contribution of sco was shown to remain stable during the periastron in 2011 ( che et al . 2012 ) , and the mass - exchange in the lyr system can be clearly imaged ( zhao et al . 2008 ) , as well as the 3 components of algol ( baron et al . 2012 ) or the disk of the eclipsing companion of aur ( kloppenborg et al . , 2010 ) . this session has demonstrated the usefulness of studies in the ir in studying the environment of massive stars . recent advances in this domain are notably provided by surveys , as they enable discovery of new objects to study , thereby improving the census of nebular features associated with hot stars . furthermore , ir diagnostics unveil the properties of these neighbouring nebulosities : morphology , temperature , composition , density are the necessary keys paving the way of a better understanding of the mass - loss in massive stars . yn acknowledges comments from augusto daminelli and support from fnrs and prodex herschel / xmm - integral contracts . nljc thanks fwo and prodex - herschel for financial support . jhg is supported by an ambizione fellowship of the swiss national science foundation . cdl has been supported financially by grant nsc-101 - 2922-i-008 - 120 of the national science council of taiwan .", "summary": "the last part of sps5 dealt with the circumstellar environment . structures are indeed found around several types of massive stars , such as blue and red supergiants , as well as wrs and lbvs . as shown in the last years , the potential of ir for their study is twofold : first , ir can help discover many previously unknown nebulae , leading to the identification of new massive stars as their progenitors ; second , ir can help characterize the nebular features . current and new ir facilities thus pave the way to a better understanding of the feedback from massive stars ."}
{"article": "this paper presents data for the last two patches ( c and d ) of the sky observed by the public eso imaging survey ( eis ) , being carried out in preparation for the first year of regular operation of vlt . the i - band data reported here covers a total area of 12 square degrees , down to , corresponding to two patches probing separated regions of the sky , 6 square degrees each . the present work complements earlier papers in the series ( nonino 1998 ; paper i , prandoni 1998 ; paper iii ) and completes the presentation of the data accumulated by the eis observations carried out in the period july 1997-march 1998 as part of the wide - angle imaging survey originally described by renzini and da costa ( 1997 ) and in paper i. the primary science goal for surveying patches c and d was to search for and produce a list of distant galaxy cluster candidates that would complement those of the other two patches ( a and b ) reported earlier ( olsen 1998a , b : paper ii and v ) , providing vlt targets nearly year - round . patches c and d were also selected to overlap with the ongoing 92 cm westerbork survey in the southern hemisphere ( wish ) being carried out in the region and . originally , the eis observations were expected to be carried out in two passbands ( v and i ) . however , because of time constraints and the prospect of supplementing the eis observations at the ntt with the new wide - field imager for the 2.2 m eso / mpia telescope , preference was given to increase the area covered by the i - band observations , more suitable for identifying distant clusters with ( see paper v ) . this decision allowed the full coverage of the selected patches , yielding a total coverage of 12 square degrees . combined with the data for patches a and b the eis i - band data covers a total area of about 17 square degrees , currently the largest available survey of its kind in the southern hemisphere . the goal of the present paper is to describe the characteristics of the i - band observations of patches c and d. in section 2 , the observations , calibration and the quality of the data are described . in section 3 , the object catalogs extracted from the images are examined and compared with data from the other patches and other data sets to comparable depth . concluding remarks are presented in section 4 . the observations of patches c and d were carried out over several months in the period november ( december for patch d ) 1997 to march 1998 , using the red channel of the emmi camera on the 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla . the red channel of emmi is equipped with a tektronix 2046 2046 chip with a pixel size of 0.266 arcsec and a useful field - of - view of about . the observations were carried out as a series of overlapping 150 sec exposures , with each position on the sky being sampled at least twice , using the wide - band filter wb829#797 described in paper i , and for which the color term relative to the cousins system is small . the data for patches c and d consist of 1348 frames but only 1203 were accepted for final analysis , discarding 145 frames obtained in poor seeing condition ( arcsec ) . the frames actually accepted have a seeing in the range 0.5 to 1.6 arcsec , considerably better than the data available for patches a and b obtained at the peak of el nio . figure shows the seeing distribution of all observed frames in each patch . for comparison the figure also shows the seeing distribution of the accepted frames , with the vertical lines in each panel indicating the median seeing and the quartiles of the distribution . from the figure one finds that the median seeing for both patches is sub - arcsec ( arcsec ) with only 25% of the area covered by frames with a seeing larger than 1 arcsec . the good quality of the observations can also be seen from figure which shows the limiting isophote within 1 arcsec for each patch . apart from one subrow in patch c , in both cases the limiting isophote is typically 25.3 mag arcsec . the two - dimensional distributions of the seeing and limiting isophote are shown in figures and . comparison with similar distributions presented in earlier papers ( paper i and iii ) shows that the data for patches c and d are significantly better . note that for each patch tables are available listing the position of each accepted frame , its seeing , limiting isophote and photometric zero - point and can be found at `` http://www.eso.org/eis '' . in late february 1998 , a realignment of the secondary mirror was carried out by the ntt team in an attempt to minimize the image distortions seen in the upper part , especially the upper - right corner , of the emmi frames . some frames for patch c and most of the frames in patch d were observed with the new setup of the ntt . examination of the point spread function for these frames showed no significant improvement in the quality of the images . this points out the need to introduce a position - dependent estimator for the point - spread function to assure uniformity in the star / galaxy separation across the frame . this is particularly important for images observed under good seeing conditions . in fact , examining the uniformity of the classification as a function of position on the chip it is found that there is a 10% increase in the density of galaxies at the upper edge of the chip , due to misclassifications , significantly larger than that seen in paper i. in the last three runs ( january - march ) it was also noticed faint ( at the level of the background noise ) linear features aligned along the east - west direction ( perpendicular to the readout axis ) associated with moderately bright stars located in the lower half of the ccd not previously seen . the cause for the these features are at the present time unclear but are probably due to the electronic of the old - generation ccd controller of emmi , when used in a dual - port readout mode . these affects two - thirds of the patch c frames and essentially all the patch d frames . these light trails occur randomly in the patch and there is no obvious way of correcting for them a priori . an important consequence of this problem is that it leads to a localized increase in the detection of low - surface brightness objects over a range of magnitudes ( typically ) which can have a significant impact in the cluster detection algorithm ( scodeggio 1998 , paper vii ) . this is unfortunate because both patches c and d are located at lower galactic latitudes  with almost an order of magnitude larger density of stars than the previous patches . the photometric calibration of the patch was carried out , as described in papers i and iii , by determining a common zero - point for all frames from the solution of a global least - squares fit to all the relative zero - points , constraining their sum to be equal to zero . the absolute zero - point was determined by a simple zero - point offset determined from the common zero - point of all frames observed in photometric conditions . there are 340 and 290 such frames , covering about 80% and 60% of the surveyed area , in patches c and d , respectively ( see figure ) . the zero - points for these frames were determined using a total of 10 fields containing of the order of 45 standard stars taken from landolt ( 1992 a , b ) , observed in 10 nights for patch c and in 11 nights for patch d. altogether 215 independent measurements of standards in the three passbands were used in the calibration . comparison with external data suggests that a zero - point offset provides an adequate photometric calibration for the entire patch . in order to check the photometric calibration and the uniformity of the zero - points , strips from the denis survey ( epchtein 1996 ) crossing the surveyed area the regions of overlap of these data are shown in figure , which shows that there are five strips crossing patch c and two strips crossing patch d. in the figure the regions observed under photometric conditions are also indicated . comparison of this figure with their counterparts presented in papers i and iii , clearly shows that the data for patches c and d are of superior quality , with a much larger fraction of frames taken under photometric conditions . in order to investigate possible systematic errors in the photometric zero - point over the scale of the patch , the eis catalogs were compared with object catalogs extracted from the denis strips that cross the survey regions ( see figure ) . comparison of the catalogs allows one to investigate the variation of the zero - point over the patch . the results are shown in figure . the domain in which the comparison can be made is relatively small because of saturation of objects in eis at the bright end  and the shallow magnitude limit of denis  . still , within the two magnitudes where comparison is possible one finds a roughly constant zero - point offset of less than 0.02 mag for both strips and a scatter of mag that can be attributed to the errors in the denis magnitudes ( deul 1998 ) . in order to evaluate the quality of the data simple statistics computed from the object catalogs extracted from the images are compared in this section with model predictions and other data sets . the catalogs derived from individual frames are used to generate the even , odd and best seeing catalogs , described in earlier papers . the spatial distribution of stars and galaxies , defined using similar star / galaxy classification criteria as in previous papers of the series , are shown in figures and down to and for stars and galaxies , respectively . the latter corresponds roughly to the completeness limit of the object catalog . this limit was established using the object catalog extracted from the co - addition of images of a reference frame taken periodically during the observations of a patch . note that because of the much better seeing star / galaxy classification is possible down to and the completeness is about 0.5 mag deeper . some improvement in the classification is expected from a new estimator being implemented in sextractor based on a position - dependent psf fitting scheme currently being tested . this new version should also improve the uniformity of the classification across the chip . the distribution of the stars and galaxies shown in figures and is remarkably homogeneous and considerably better than those seen in the previous eis patches due to the much better observing conditions . this is true except for a small region of about 0.2 square degrees in patch c which has been removed , as indicated in figure . the only problem seen with the galaxy catalogs in these patches is the presence of several relatively thin linear features clearly seen at high resolution ( see eis release page ) . these features are a consequence of the electronic problem mentioned above and are not easily corrected for at the image level . in order to evaluate the data the general properties of the extracted object catalogs are investigated and compared with model predictions and other data sets . note that patches c and d are located at lower galactic latitude and the number of stars is considerably larger . in addition , the seeing is considerably better than in previous patches . therefore , it is of interest to re - evaluate the overall performance of the eis pipeline reduction under these new conditions . figure , shows the comparison of the star counts for patches c and d derived using the stellar sample extracted from the object catalogs , with the predicted counts based on a galactic model composed of an old - disk , a thick disk and a halo . the star - counts have been computed using the model described by mndez and van altena ( 1996 ) , using the standard parameters described in their table 1 and an of 0.015 and 0.010 for patches c and d , respectively . it is important to emphasize that no attempt has been made to fit any of the model parameters to the observed counts . the model is used solely as a guide to evaluate the data . as can be seen there is a good agreement at bright magnitudes  , but the observed counts show an excess at fainter magnitudes  . even though it is unlikely that this excess is due to misclassified galaxies at these relatively bright magnitudes , a better agreement can be achieved if a higher stellarity index is assumed . on the other hand , it is also possible that the model underestimates the contribution of the thick - disk which makes a significant contribution in this magnitude range . the steep drop in the stellar counts beyond is partially due to the relatively high stellarity index adopted , which was chosen to minimize the losses of galaxies . by adopting a stellarity index of 0.5 the drop in the counts may be avoided down to . however , at these magnitudes and this value of the stellarity index contamination by galaxies may be significant . another potential problem at these faint magnitudes is the misclassification of stars as a consequence of the distortion effects in emmi , that can have some impact for images taken in good seeing conditions . in order to evaluate the depth of the galaxy samples , galaxy counts in patches c and d are compared with those of previous patches in figure . there is a remarkable agreement among the counts derived for the different patches , indicating that the identification of galaxies has not been affected by the observations at lower galactic latitudes . the galaxy counts obtained from the different patches have been combined to compute the mean galaxy counts and the variance . this is also shown in figure where it is compared to other ground - based counts ( postman 1998 ) and those from hdf ( williams 1996 ) , appropriately converted to the cousins system ( see paper iii ) . as can be seen the eis galaxy counts agree extremely well with the ground - based data covering comparable area over the entire magnitude range down to and with the bright end of the hdf counts . the excellent internal and external agreement of the i - band galaxy counts serves as a confirmation of the reliability of the eis galaxy catalogs . extraction from co - added images should allow reaching about 0.5 mag deeper . one way of examining the overall uniformity of the galaxy catalogs is to use the two - point angular correlation function , , as departures from uniformity should affect the correlation function especially at faint magnitudes . the latter should be sensitive to artificial patterns , especially to the imprint of the individual frames , or possible gradients in the density over the field , which could result from large - scale gradients of the photometric zero - point . note that any residual effect due to the improper association of objects in the border of overlapping frames would lead to a grid pattern ( see the weight map in the eis release page ) that could impact the angular correlation function . figure shows obtained for different magnitude intervals for both patches , using the estimator proposed by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) . the calculation has been done over the entire area of patch d and most of the area of patch c , with only one subrow ( 10 consecutive frames ) removed according to the discussion above ( see section ) . for comparison , computed for the other patches are also shown ( papers i and iii ) from which the cosmic variance can be evaluated directly from the data . as can be seen there is a remarkable agreement for all the magnitude intervals considered . moreover , the larger contiguous area of patches c and d allows to estimate the angular correlation function out to degree . in all cases is well described by a power law with in the range 0.7 - 0.8 . note that for patch b the results refer to the galaxy sample obtained after removing the foreground cluster ( see paper iii ) . in particular , there is no evidence for any underlying pattern associated with the overlap of different frames . the effect on was evaluated by carrying out simulations by adding to the observed galaxy distribution a grid pattern with different density contrast . it was found that for high contrast this would lead to local depressions in the angular correlation function on scales of half the size of the diagonal of the grid and its multiples , with the depth of depression depending on the relative density . none such features are seen further indicating the uniformity of the derived galaxy catalogs . finally , note that the good agreement of for the different patches confirms that the observed small - scale linear features associated with the faint light trails , mentioned in section , have very little impact in the angular correlation function . as shown in paper iii the dependence of the amplitude of the correlation function on the limiting magnitude of the sample is consistent with earlier estimates based on significantly smaller areas and the recent results reported by postman ( 1998 ) . these results show that the eis galaxy catalogs are spatially uniform and form a homogeneous data set independent of the patch , yielding reproducible results . finally , note that even though a single power - law with a slope between 0.7 - 0.8 gives a reasonable fit for the correlation computed in all magnitude bins , there is some indication that for fainter samples  the angular correlation function may be better represented by two distinct power - laws . on small scales  the slope remains the same while on larger scales it becomes gradually flatter . a similar behavior is seen in the computed for all four patches . this flattening seems to be consistent with earlier claims by campos ( 1995 ) and neuschaefer and windhorst ( 1995 ) using significantly smaller samples , and more recently by postman ( 1998 ) with a sample of similar size to eis but covering a single contiguous area . one year after the first observations , the full data set accumulated by eis is being made public in the form of astrometrically and photometrically calibrated pixel maps and object catalogs extracted from individual images . in addition , separate papers have presented derived catalogs listing candidate targets for follow - up work . the eis data set consists of about 6000 science and calibration frames , totaling 96 gb of raw data and over 200 gb of reduced images and derived products . all the information regarding these frames are maintained in a continuously growing database . together with the science archive group a comprehensive interface has been built to provide users with a broad range of products and information regarding the survey . from the verification of the object catalogs and their comparison against model predictions and other observations , it has been found that the extracted catalogs are reliable and uniform . when all patches are included , the combined eis galaxy catalog contains about one million galaxies and it is by far the largest data set of faint galaxies currently available in the southern hemisphere . the star counts show a good agreement with current galactic models , especially at high - galactic latitudes , and the galaxy counts agree remarkably well with other ground - based observations as well as with the counts derived from hdf . the data from the different patches seem to be rather homogeneous , as strongly suggested from measurements of the angular two - point correlation function which should be sensitive to large - scale gradients in a patch or to relative offsets of the photometric zero - points for the different patches . as expected eis - wide has provided large samples ( 50 to over 200 candidates ) of distant clusters of galaxies ( olsen 1998a , b , scodeggio 1998 ) and of potentially interesting point sources ( zaggia 1998 ) , more than adequate for the first year of observations with vlt , the main goal of eis . some of the targets can also be observed nearly year round . in order to expedite the delivery of the products all the results refer to single exposure frames as discussed in the previous papers of the series . even though co - addition has been done for all the patches some problems have been uncovered during the verification of the object catalogs extracted from them and require further work . however , the samples already public are sufficiently deep and large for programs to be conducted in the first year of operation of the vlt . the results obtained from the co - added images will become available before the vlt proposal deadline . this paper completes the first phase of eis which will now focus on the deep observations of the hdf - south  and axaf deep  fields . the results presented so far show the value of a public survey providing the community at large with the basic data and tools required to prepare follow - up observations at 8-m class telescopes . the experience acquired by eis in pipeline processing , data archiving and mining will now be transferred to the pilot survey , a deep wide - angle imaging survey to be conducted with the wide - field camera mounted on the eso / mpia 2.2 m telescope . we thank all the people directly or indirectly involved in the eso imaging survey effort . in particular , all the members of the eis working group for the innumerable suggestions and constructive criticisms , the eso archive group and the st -

{"article": "over the past 70 years , there have been multiple attempts to dynamically model the movement of polymer chains with brownian dynamics , which have more recently been used as a model for dna filament dynamics . one of the first and simplest descriptions was given as the rouse model , which is a bead - spring model , where the continuous filament is modelled at a mesoscopic scale with beads connected by springs . the only forces exerted on beads are spring forces from adjacent springs , as well as gaussian noise . hydrodynamic forces between beads and excluded volume effects are neglected in the model in favour of simplicity and computational speed , but the model manages to agree with several properties of polymer chains from experiments . other models exist , for example the zimm model introduces hydrodynamic forces between beads , or bending potentials can be introduced to form a wormlike chain and give a notion of persistence length , see , for example , review article or books on this subject . most of the aforementioned models consider the filament on only a single scale . in some applications , a modeller is interested in a relatively small region of a complex system . then it is often possible to use a hybrid model which is more accurate in the region of interest , and couple this with a model which is more computationally efficient in the rest of the simulated domain . an application area for hybrid models of polymer chains is binding of a protein to the dna filament , which we study in this paper . the model which we have created uses rouse dynamics for a chain of dna , along with a freely diffusing particle to represent a binding protein . as the protein approaches the dna , we increase the resolution in the nearby dna filament to increase accuracy of our simulations , whilst keeping them computationally efficient . in this paper we use the rouse model for analysis due to its mathematical tractability and small computational load . such a model is applicable to modelling dna dynamics when we consider relatively low resolutions , when hydrodynamic forces are negligible and persistence length is significantly shorter than the kuhn length between each bead . the situation becomes more complicated when we consider dna modelling at higher spatial resolutions . inside the cell nucleus , genetic information is stored within strands of long and thin dna fibres , which are separated into chromosomes . these dna fibres are folded into structures related to their function . different genes can be enhanced or inhibited depending upon this structure . folding also minimises space taken up in the cell by dna , and can be unfolded when required by the cell for different stages in the cell cycle or to alter gene expression . the folding of dna occurs on multiple scales . on a microscopic scale , dna is wrapped around histone proteins to form the nucleosome structure . this in turn gets folded into a chromatin fibre which gets packaged into progressively higher order structures until we reach the level of the entire chromosome . the finer points of how the nucleosome packing occurs on the chromatin fibre and how these are then packaged into higher - order structures is still a subject of much debate , with long - held views regarding mesoscopic helical fibres becoming less fashionable in favour of more irregular structures in vivo . in the most compact form of chromatin , many areas of dna are not reachable for vital reactions such as transcription . one potential explanation to how this is overcome by the cell is to position target dna segments at the surface of condensed domains when it is needed , so that transcription factors can find expressed genes without having to fit into these tightly - packed structures . this complexity is not captured by the multiscale model of protein binding presented in this paper . however , if one uses the developed refinement of the rouse model together with a more detailed modelling approach in a small region of dna next to the binding protein , then such a hybrid model can be used to study the effects of microscopic details on processes over system - level spatial and temporal scales . when taking this multiscale approach , it is necessary to understand the error from including the less accurate model in the hybrid model and how the accuracy of the method depends on its parameters . these are the main questions studied in this paper . the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section , we introduce a multi - resolution bead - spring model which generalizes the rouse model . we also introduce a discretized version of this model which enables the use of different timesteps in different spatial regions . in section , we analyze the main properties of the multi - resolution bead - spring model . we prove two main lemmas giving formulas for the diffusion constant and the end - to - end distance . we also study the appropriate choice of timesteps for numerical simulations of the model and support our analysis by the results of illustrative computer simulations . our main application area is studied in section where we present and analyze a dna binding model . we develop a method to increase the resolution in existing segments on - the - fly using the metropolis - hastings algorithm . in section , we conclude our paper by discussing possible extensions of the presented multiscale approach ( by including more detailed models of dna dynamics ) and other multiscale methods developed in the literature . we generalize the classical rouse bead - spring polymer model to include beads of variable sizes and springs with variable spring constants . in definition , we formulate the evolution equation for this model as a system of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) . we will also introduce a discretized version of this model in algorithm , which will be useful in sections and where we use the multi - resolution bead - spring model to develop and analyze multiscale models for dna dynamics . let be a positive integer . a multi - resolution bead - spring polymer of size consists of a chain of beads of radius , for , connected by springs which are characterized by their spring constants , for . the positions ] is a wiener process , is absolute temperature , is boltzmann s constant and we assume that each spring constant can be equivalently expressed in terms of the corresponding kuhn length by we assume that the behaviour of boundary beads ( for and ) is also given by equation simplified by postulating and ] in figure , we schematically illustrate a multi - resolution bead - spring polymer for . the region between the -th and the -th bead is described with the highest resolution by considering smaller beads and springs with larger spring constants ( or equivalently with smaller kuhn lengths ) . the scalings of different parameters in definition are chosen so that we recover the classical rouse model if we assume and . then equation  simplifies to where , and we again define and in equations for boundary beads . in the polymer physics literature , the rouse model  is equivalently written as where random thermal noises exerted on the beads from brownian motion are characterized by the moments where and . for the remainder of this paper , we will use the sde notation as given in  , because we will often study numerical schemes for simulating polymer dynamics models . the simplest discretization of  is given by the euler - maruyama method , which uses the finite timestep and calculates the position vector of the -th bead , , at discretised time by for , where is normally distributed random variable with zero mean and unit variance ( i.e. ) for . in order to discretize the multi - resolution bead - spring model , we allow for variable timesteps . let and let , be positive integers such that or for . let us assume that at least one of the values of is equal to 1 . we define for and we call a timestep associated with the -th spring . definition specifies that all timesteps must be integer multiples of the smallest timestep . the timesteps associated with two adjacent springs are also multiples of each other . the time evolution of the multi - resolution bead - spring model is computed at integer multiples of . one iteration of the algorithm is shown in algorithm . the position of the -th bead is updated at integer multiples of by calculating the random displacement due to brownian motion , with displacement caused by springs attached to the bead also updated at integer multiples of the timesteps associated with each spring , i.e. or considering the situation that all beads , springs and timesteps are the same , then one can easily deduce the following result . update positions of internal beads which are connected to two springs : + update of the first bead : + update of the last bead : + let , , and be positive constants and be an integer . consider a multi - resolution bead - spring polymer of size with , , for , and , for . let the timesteps associated with each spring be equal to , i.e. in definition then algorithm is equivalent to the euler - maruyama discretization of the rouse model given as equation . lemma shows that the multi - resolution bead - spring model is a generalization of the rouse model . in the next section , we will study properties of this model which will help us to select the appropriate parameter values for this model and use it in multiscale simulations of dna dynamics . we have formulated a multiscale rouse model which varies the kuhn lengths throughout the filament , but we would like to keep properties of the overall filament constant regardless of the resolution regime being considered for the filament . we consider a global statistic for the system to be consistent if the expected value of the statistic is invariant to the resolution regime being considered for the filament . we consider the self diffusion constant and root mean squared ( rms ) end - to - end distance as two statistics we wish to be consistent in our system , which can be ensured by varying the bead radius and the number of beads respectively . the precise way to vary these properties will be explored in this section . the self diffusion constant is defined as where is the centre of mass of the polymer chain at time , which is defined by definition  is an extension to the definition given by doi and edwards for the centre of mass of a continuous chain on only one scale . if all beads have the same radius ( i.e. if for ) , then equation  simplifies to the centre of mass definition for the classical rouse model . in this case , the self diffusion constant is given by where is the number of beads . this result explains the , on the face of it , counterintuitive scaling of equation  with . if we suppose that each bead had the same density , then the mass of each bead would be proportional to its volume , i.e. to . however , in definition  , we have used weights instead of because beads do not represent physical bead objects like nucleosomes , but representations of the filament around it , so the bead radius scales with the amount of surrounding filament , which is linear in bead radius in this formulation . if we consider dna applications , we could imagine each bead as a tracker for individual base pairs at intervals of , say , thousands of base pairs away from each other along the dna filament . the filament in the model is then drawn between adjacent beads . this linear scaling with can also be confirmed using equation  for the classical rouse model . if we describe the same polymer using a more detailed model consisting of twice as many beads ( i.e. if we change to ) , then we have to halve the bead radius ( i.e. change to ) to get a polymer model with the same diffusion constant  . in particular , the mass of a bead scales with ( and not with ) . in the next lemma , we extend result  to a general multi - resolution bead - spring model . let us consider a multi - resolution bead - spring polymer of size and a set of timesteps associated with each spring satisfying the assumptions of definitions and . then the self diffusion constant of the polymer evolution described by algorithm is given by algorithm describes one iteration of our numerical scheme . multiplying the steps corresponding to the -th bead by and summing over all beads , we obtain how changes during one timestep . since , tension terms cancel after summation and the evolution rule for simplifies to where ] , where we used the fact that the sum of normally distributed random variables is again normally distributed . dividing equation  by , we obtain .\\ ] ] using definition  , we obtain  . the formula  is a generalization of equation  obtained for the rouse model . it is invariant to the resolutions provided that the mass of the filament remains constant through selection of the number of beads and bead radius , therefore the self diffusion constant is consistent . we define the end - to - end vector from one end of the filament to the other . an important statistic to consider related to this is the root mean squared ( rms ) end - to - end distance of the filament . the expected value of the long - time limit of the rms end - to - end distance , denoted , for the classical rouse model is given by we generalize this result in the following lemma . let us consider a multi - resolution bead - spring polymer of size satisfying the assumptions of definition . then and the long - time limit of the rms end - to - end distance is given by equations  describe a system of linear sdes . however , the sdes corresponding to different spatial dimensions are not coupled . we therefore restrict our investigation to the behaviour of the first coordinates of each vector in  . let us arrange the differences of the first coordinates of subsequent beads into the -dimensional vector .\\ ] ] then sdes  can be rewritten to the system of sdes for in the matrix form where is a three - diagonal matrix given by is a two - diagonal matrix given by and is -dimensional noise vector ^t . ] of the protein from the middle bead of the filament . we estimate as a fraction of simulations which end up with the protein bound to dna . each data point in figure represents the value of estimated from independent realizations of the process . if , then the protein is immediately bound to dna , i.e. for . if , then the probability of binding is nonzero , because the initial placement , , is the distance of the protein from the centre of the filament . in particular , the minimum distance from protein to filament is less than or equal to the initial placement distance , , and the simulations ( with the possibility of binding ) take place even if . , depending on starting distance , , from the filament for the single - scale ( black points ) and omr ( blue line ) models . error bars give a 95% confidence interval based on the wilson score interval for binomial distributions . ] due to computational constraints of the single - scale model we consider a selection of initial distances at points m , ( black points ) , where error bars give a 95% confidence interval based on the wilson score interval for binomial distributions . we run simulations for more initial distances , m , ( blue line ) , using the computationally efficient omr model and present our results as the blue line in figure . we see that is very similar between the single - scale and omr models . the model also succeeds in reducing computational time . for simulations with the protein starting from the middle bead , with parameters given in table , the omr model represented a 3.2-times speedup compared to the detailed model , with only a 3-times resolution difference . we expect for larger resolution differences to see greater improvements in speed . in this paper we have extended basic filament modelling techniques to multiple scales by developing omr methods . we have presented an mcmc approach for increasing the resolution along a static filament segment , as well as an extension to the rouse model to dynamically model a filament which considers multiple scales . the bead radius , as well as the number of beads associated with each resolution , is altered to maintain consistency with the end - to - end distance and diffusion of a filament across multiple scales , as well as the timestep to ensure numerical convergence . we have then illustrated the omr methodology using a simple model of protein binding to a dna filament , in which the omr model gave similar results to the single - scale model . we have also observed a 3.2-times speed - up in computational time on a model which considers only a 3-times increase in resolution , which illustrates the use of the omr approach as a method to speed up simulations whilst maintaining the same degree of accuracy as the more computationally intensive single - scale model . the speed - up in computational time could be further increased by replacing brownian dynamics based on time - discretization  by event - based algorithms such as the fpkmc ( first passage kinetic monte carlo ) and gfrd ( green s function reaction dynamics ) methods . when considering the zooming out of the dna binding model , note that it is generally possible to zoom in and out repetitively , as long as the dynamics are such that we can generate a high resolution structure independent from the previous one ( i.e. , once we zoom out , the microscopic structure is completely forgotten ) . however , particularly in the case of chromatin , histone modification and some dna - binding proteins may act as long - term memory at a microscopic scale below the scales currently considered . to reflect the effect of the memory , some properties of the microscopic structure should be maintained even after zooming out . fractal dimension may serve as a candidate of indices , which can be also estimated in living cells by single - molecule tracking experiments . the omr method could be applied to modern simulations of dna and other biological polymers which use the rouse model in situations where certain regions of the polymer require higher resolutions than other regions . the model considered in this report uses rouse dynamics , which is moderately accurate given its simplicity , but as we zoom in further towards a binding site , then we will need to start to consider hydrodynamic forces and excluded volume effects acting between beads . models which include hydrodynamic interactions such as the zimm model have previously been used to look at filament dynamics . therefore it is of interest to have a hybrid model which uses the rouse model in low resolutions and the zimm model in high resolutions . the combination of different dynamical models might give interesting results regarding hierarchical structures forming as we move between resolutions . as we go into higher resolutions , strands of dna can be modelled as smooth , unlike the fjc model where angles between beads are unconstrained . the wormlike chain model of kratky and porod , implemented via algorithm by hagermann and zimm , gives a non - uniform probability distribution for the angles between each bead . allison then implements the zimm model dynamics on top of the static formulation to give bending as well as stretching forces . another interesting open multiscale problem is to implement this at higher resolutions , with the rouse model at lower resolutions , in order to design a hybrid model . to introduce even more realism , we would see individual histones and consider forces between these as in the model of rosa and everaers which includes lennard - jones and fene forces between beads . as we approach an atomistic level , it may be interesting to consider a molecular dynamics approach to modelling the dna filament . coarser brownian dynamics models can be estimated from molecular dynamics models either analytically or numerically , depending on the complexity of the molecular dynamics model . a variety of structure - based coarse - grained models have been used for chromatin ( e.g. ) , also with transcription factors . multiscale modelling techniques ( e.g. with iterative coarse - graining ) , as well as adaptive resolution models ( e.g. for solvent molecules ) , have been developed . we expect these studies will connect with polymer - like models at a certain appropriate length and time scale . on top of this , models for the target searching process by proteins such as transcription factors could be improved ( for example , by incorporating facilitated diffusion under crowded environment ) . the need for developing and analyzing multiscale models of dna which use one of the above detailed simulation approaches for small parts of the dna filament is further stimulated by recent experimental results . chromosome conformation capture ( 3c)-related techniques , particularly at a genome - wide level using high - throughput sequencing ( hi - c ) , provide the three - dimensional structure of the chromosomes in an averaged manner . moreover , recent imaging techniques have enabled us to observe simultaneously the motion and transcription of designated gene loci in living cells . simulated processes could be compared with such experimental results . recent hi - c experiments also revealed fine structures such as loops induced by dna - binding proteins . to develop more realistic models , information about the binding sites for these proteins may be utilized when we increase the resolution in our scheme . s. shinkai , t. nozaki , k. maeshima , and y. togashi . dynamic nucleosome movement provides structural information of topological chromatin domains in living human cells . biorxiv doi:10.1101/059147 , 2016 .", "summary": "a multi -

{"article": "a geodesic flow in a given direction on a translation surface induces on a transverse segment an interval exchange map . dynamic of such transformations has been extensively studied during these last thirty years providing applications to billiards in rational polygons , to measured foliations on surfaces , to teichmller geometry and dynamics , etc . interval exchange transformations are closely related to abelian differentials on riemann surfaces . it is well known that the continued fractions encode cutting sequences of hyperbolic geodesics on the poincar upper half - plane . similarly , the rauzy - veech induction ( analogous to euclidean algorithm ) provides a discrete model for the teichmller geodesics flow  . using this relation h. masur in and w. a. veech in have independently proved the keane s conjecture ( unique ergodicity of almost all interval exchange transformations ) . using combinatorics of rauzy classes , kontsevich and zorich classified the connected components of strata of the moduli spaces of abelian differentials . more recently , avila , gouzel and yoccoz proved the exponential decay of correlations for the teichmller geodesic flow also using a renormalization of the rauzy - veech induction ( see ) . avila and viana used combinatorics of rauzy - veech induction to prove the simplicity of the essential part of the lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic flow on the strata of abelian differentials ( see ) . recently bufetov and gurevich proved the existence and uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy for the teichmller geodesic flow on the moduli space of abelian differentials . avila and forni proved the weak mixing for almost all interval exchange transformations and translation flows . these examples show that rauzy - veech induction which was initially elaborated to prove ergodicity of interval exchange transformations and ergodicity of the teichmller geodesic flow is , actually , very efficient far beyond these initial problems . however , all the aforementioned results concern only the moduli space of abelian differentials . the corresponding questions for strata of strict quadratic differentials ( i.e. of those , which are not global squares of abelian differentials ) remain open . note that the ( co)tangent bundle to the moduli space of curves is naturally identified with the moduli space of quadratic differentials . from this point of view , the strata of abelian differentials represent special orbifolds of high codimension in the total space of the tangent bundle . our interest in teichmller dynamics and geometry of the strata of strict quadratic differentials was one of the main motivations for developing rauzy - veech induction for quadratic differentials . natural generalizations of interval exchange transformations were introduced by danthony and nogueira in ( see also ) as cross sections of measured foliations on surfaces . they introduced the notion of linear involutions , as well as the notion of rauzy induction on these maps . studying lyapunov spectrum of the teichmller geodesic flow kontsevich and zorich have performed series of computer experiments with linear involutions corresponding to quadratic differentials . these experiments indicated appearance of attractors for the rauzy - veech induction , as well as examples of generalized permutations such that the corresponding linear involutions are minimal for a domain of parameters of positive measure , and non minimal for a complementary domain of parameters also of positive measure ( examples of this type are presented in figure and figure in appendix ) . but at this point , there was no combinatorial explanation . thus , in order to generalize technique of rauzy - veech induction to quadratic differentials in a consistent way it was necessary to find combinatorial criteria allowing to identify generalized permutations , which belong to attractors and those ones , which represents cross sections of vertical foliations of quadratic differentials . it was also necessary to distinguish those generalized permutation which give rise to minimal linear involution , and to specify the domains of appropriate parameters . in this paper we establish corresponding combinatorial criteria , which enable us to develop technique of rauzy - veech induction for quadratic differentials . partial results in this direction were obtained by the second author in . we also study relations between combinatorics , geometry and dynamics of linear involutions . to compare similarities and differences between linear involutions corresponding to abelian and to quadratic differentials let us first briefly review the situation in the classical case . an interval exchange transformation is encoded by a combinatorial data ( permutation on elements ) and by a continuous data ( lengths of the intervals ) . recall that the keane s property ( see below ) is a criterion of `` irrationality '' ( which , in particular , implies minimality ) of an interval exchange transformation . this property is satisfied for almost all parameters when the permutation is irreducible ( i.e. , while when is reducible , the corresponding interval exchange map is never minimal . on the other hand the irrational interval exchange maps are precisely those that arise as cross sections of minimal vertical flows on well chosen transverse intervals . the rauzy - veech induction consists in taking the first return map of an interval exchange transformation to an appropriate smaller interval . this induction can be viewed as a dynamical system on a finite - dimensional space of interval exchange maps . the behavior of an orbit of the induction provides important information on dynamics of the interval exchange transformation representing the starting point . this information is especially useful when all iterates are well defined and when the length of the underlying subintervals tends to zero . an interval exchange transformation satisfying the latter conditions is said to have property . for a given irreducible permutation , the subset of parameters which give rise to interval exchange transformations satisfying keane s property contains all irrational parameters , and so it is a full lebesgue measure subset . moreover , for the space of interval exchange transformations with irreducible combinatorial data , the renormalized induction process is recurrent with respect to the lebesgue measure ( and even ergodic by a theorem of veech ) . note that the corresponding invariant measure has infinite total mass . in this paper we use the definition of linear involution be the involution of given by . a linear involution is a map , from into itself , of the form , where is an involution of without fixed point , continuous except in finitely many points , and which preserves the lebesgue measure . in this paper we will only consider linear involutions with the additional condition . the derivative of is at if and belong to the same connected component , and otherwise ; see also convention . ] proposed by danthony and nogueira ( see ) . as above , a linear involution is encoded by a combinatorial data ( `` generalized permutation '' ) and by continuous data . a generalized permutation of type ( with ) is a two - to - one map to an alphabet . a generalized permutation is called irreducible if there exists a linear involution associated to this generalized permutation , which represents an appropriate cross section of the vertical foliation of some quadratic differential . a generalized permutation is called dynamically irreducible if there exists a minimal linear involution associated to this generalized permutation . it is easy to show that any irreducible generalized permutation is dynamically irreducible ; the converse is not true in general as we will see . irreducible and dynamically irreducible generalized permutations can be characterized by natural criteria expressed in elementary combinatorial terms . the corresponding criteria are stated as definitions and definition respectively . consider a dynamically irreducible generalized permutation . the parameter space of normalized linear involutions associated to is represented by a hyperplane section of a simplex . we describe an explicit procedure which associates to each generalized permutation an open subset in the parameter space defined by a system of linear inequalities determined by . this subset is called the set of admissible parameters . when is irreducible , the set of admissible parameters coincides with entire parameter space ; in general it is smaller . the next result gives a more precise statement than theorem in the dynamically irreducible case . 1 . if is not dynamically irreducible , or if is dynamically irreducible , but does not belong to the set of admissible parameters , the linear involution is not minimal . if is dynamically irreducible , then for almost all admissible parameters the linear involution satisfies the keane s property , and hence is minimal . since the rauzy - veech induction commutes with dilatations , it projectivizes to a map on the space of normalized linear involutions ; we shall call this map the renormalized rauzy - veech induction . let t be a linear involution on the unit interval and let us consider a sequence of iterates by the renormalized rauzy - veech induction . 1 . if has the keane s property , then there exists such that is irreducible for all . the renormalized rauzy - veech induction , defined on the set , is recurrent . having a generalized permutation we can define one or two other generalized permutations and reflecting the possibilities for the image of the rauzy - veech induction . these combinatorial rauzy operations define a partial order in the set of irreducible permutations represented by an oriented graph . rauzy class is a connected component of this graph . note that geometry of the rauzy graphs is very different and more complicated than in the case of `` true '' permutations since for some irreducible generalized permutations one of the rauzy operations might be not defined . from theorem we will deduce that a rauzy class is an equivalence class for the equivalence relation given by these combinatorial operations ( see proposition ) . in analogy with the case of the `` true '' permutations , we introduce one more combinatorial operation on generalized permutations and define extended rauzy classes as minimal subsets of irreducible generalized permutations invariant under these corresponding three operations . the moduli spaces of abelian differentials and of quadratic differentials are stratified by multiplicities of the zeroes of the corresponding differentials . we denote a stratum of the moduli space of strict quadratic differentials ( with at most simple poles ) by , where are the multiplicities of the zeroes ( corresponds to a pole ) . extended rauzy classes of irreducible generalized permutations are in one - to - one correspondence with connected components of strata in the moduli spaces of quadratic differentials . historically , extended rauzy classes where used to prove the non - connectedness of some strata of abelian differentials . for permutations of a small number of elements , it is easy to construct explicitly the subset of irreducible permutations and then using the rauzy operations to decompose it into a disjoint union of extended rauzy classes . using this approach veech proved that the minimal stratum in genus has two connected components and arnoux proved that the minimal stratum in genus has three connected components ( for abelian differentials ) . having established an explicit combinatorial criterion of irreducibility of a generalized permutation ( namely theorem ) one can apply theorem to classify the connected components of all strata of quadratic differentials of sufficiently small dimension . this justifies , in particular , the following experimental result of zorich . each of the following four exceptional strata of quadratic differentials and contains exactly two connected components . note that a theorem of the second author classifies all connected components of all other strata of meromorphic quadratic differentials with at most simple poles . these strata are either connected , or contain exactly two connected components one of which being hyperelliptic . the same theorem proves that each of the remaining four exceptional strata might have at most two connected components . however , the only currently available proof of the fact they are disconnected is the one based on explicit calculation of the extended rauzy classes and corresponds to the theorem of zorich . it would be interesting to have an algebraic - geometrico proof of the last theorem ; namely a topological invariant as in the kontsevich - zorich s classification . note also that a paper of zorich gives explicits representatives elements for each extended rauzy class . see also for programs concerning calculations of these rauzy classes . in section we recall basic properties of flat surfaces , moduli spaces and interval exchange maps . in particular we recall the rauzy - veech induction and its dynamical properties . we relate these properties to irreducibility . + in section we recall the definition of a linear involution and give basics properties

and yoccoz which appears in + in section we introduce the keane s property for the linear involutions and prove the second part of theorem , that is theorem . for that we prove that satisfies the keane s property if and only if the rauzy - veech induction is always well defined and the length parameters tends to zero . then if does not satisfy the keane s property we show that there exists such that is dynamically reducible which then implies that is also dynamically reducible . + in section , we study the dynamics of the renormalized rauzy - veech map on the space of the linear involutions , and prove theorem . for that we use the teichmller geometry and the finiteness of the volume of the strata proved by masur and veech ( see ) . + section is devoted to a proof of theorem on extended rauzy classes ; we present a result of zorich based on an explicit calculation of these classes in low genera . + in the appendix we present some explicit rauzy classes as illustration of the problems which appear in the general case . we also give a property concerning the extended rauzy classes . we thank anton zorich for useful discussions . we thank arnaldo nogueira for comments and remarks on a preliminary version of this text . + this work was partially supported by the anr `` teichmller projet blanc '' anr-06-blan-0038 . in this section we review basic notions concerning flat surfaces , moduli spaces and interval exchange maps . for general references see say and . in this paper we will mostly follows notations presented in the paper , or equivalently . a flat surface is a ( real , compact , connected ) genus surface equipped with a flat metric ( with isolated conical singularities ) such that the holonomy group belongs to . here holonomy means that the parallel transport of a vector along a long loop brings the vector back to itself or to its opposite . this implies that all cone angles are integer multiples of . equivalently a flat surface is a triple such that is a topological compact connected surface , is a finite subset of ( whose elements are called singularities ) and is an atlas of such that the transition maps are translations or half - turns : , and for each , there is a neighborhood of isometric to a euclidean cone . therefore we get a quadratic differential defined locally in the coordinates by the formula . this form extends to the points of to zeroes , simple poles or marked points ( see ) . we will sometimes use the notation or simply . observe that the holonomy is trivial if and only if there exists a sub - atlas such that all transition functions are translations or equivalently if the quadratic differentials is the global square of an abelian differential . we will then say that is a translation surface . for , we define the moduli space of abelian differentials as the set of pairs modulo the equivalence relation generated by : if there exists an analytic isomorphism such that . + for , we also define the moduli space of quadratic differentials as the moduli space of pairs ( where is not the global square of any abelian differential ) modulo the equivalence relation generated by : if there exists an analytic isomorphism such that . the moduli space of abelian differentials ( respectively quadratic differentials ) is stratified by the multiplicities of the zeroes . we will denote by ( respectively ) the stratum consisting of holomorphic one - forms ( respectively quadratic differentials ) with zeroes ( or poles ) of multiplicities . these strata are non - connected in general ( for a complete classification see in the abelian differentials case and in the quadratic differentials case ) . the linear action of the -parameter subgroup of diagonal matrices on the flat surfaces presents a particular interest . it gives a measure - preserving flow with respect to a natural measure , preserving each stratum of area one flat surfaces . this flow is known as the teichmller geodesic flow . masur and veech proved the following theorem . the teichmller geodesic flow acts ergodically on each connected component of each stratum of the moduli spaces of area one abelian and quadratic differentials ( with respect to a finite measure in the lebesgue class ) . this theorem was proved by masur and veech for the case and for the case . + the ergodicity of the teichmller geodesic flow is proved in full generality in , theorem . the finiteness of the measure appears in two preprints of veech : dynamical systems on analytic manifolds of quadratic differentials i , ii ( see also p.445 ) . these preprints have been published in . in this section we recall briefly the theory of interval exchange maps . we will show that , under simple combinatorial conditions , such transformations arise naturally as poincar return maps of measured foliations and geodesic flows on translation surfaces . moreover we will present the rauzy - veech induction and its geometric and dynamical properties ( see for more details ) . let be an open interval and let us choose a finite subset of . its complement is a union of open subintervals . an interval exchange map is a one - to - one map from to a co - finite subset of that is a translation on each subinterval of its definition domain . it is easy to see that is precisely determined by the following data : a permutation that encodes how the intervals are exchanged ( expressing that the k - th interval , when numerated from the left to the right , is sent by to the place ) , and a vector with positive entries that encodes the lengths of the intervals . following marmi , moussa , yoccoz , we denote these intervals by , with a finite alphabet . the length of the intervals is a vector , and the combinatorial data is a pair of one - to - one maps . then is a one - to - one map from into itself given by . we will usually represent such a permutation by a table : let us consider the following alphabet with . then we define a permutation as follows . in this section we introduce the notion of winner and loser , following the terminology of the paper of avila , gouzel and yoccoz . for we define the type of by . we will then say that is the winner and is the loser . then we define a subinterval of by removing the loser of as follows . the rauzy - veech induction of is defined as the first return map of to the subinterval . it is easy to see that this is again an interval exchange transformation , defined on letters ( see e.g. ) . we now see how to compute the data of the new map . there are two cases to distinguish depending on whether is of type or ; the combinatorial data of only depends on and on the type of . this defines two maps and by , with the type of . 1 . has type ; equivalently the winner is . + in that case , we define by where . in an equivalent way . then where and we have if and . 2 . has type ; equivalently the winner is . + in that case , we define by where . in an equivalent way . then where and we have if and . let be an alphabet . let us consider the permutation of example . then we stress that the rauzy - veech induction is well defined if and only if the two rightmost intervals do not have the same length i.e. . in the next , we want to study the rauzy - veech induction as a dynamical system defined on the space of interval exchange transformations . thus we want the iterates of the rauzy - veech induction on to be always well defined . we also want this induction to be a good renormalization process , in the sense that the iterates correspond to inductions on subintervals that tend to zero . this leads to the definition of reducibility and to the keane s property . we will say that is reducible if there exists such that is invariant under . this means exactly that splits into two interval exchange transformations . we will say that satisfies the keane s property ( also called the infinite distinct orbit condition or i.d.o.c . property ) , if the orbits of the singularities of by are infinite . this ensures that is irreducible and the iterates of the rauzy - veech induction are always well defined . if the are rationally independent vectors , that is for all nonzero integer vectors , then satisfies the keane s property ( see ) . however the converse is not true . note that if satisfies the keane s property then is minimal . let be an interval exchange map . let us denote by the length of the interval associated to the symbol for the -th iterate of by ; we denote if it is well defined . the following are equivalent . 1 . satisfies the keane s property . the rauzy - veech induction is always well - defined and for any , the length of the intervals goes to zero as tends to infinity . as we will see this situation is very similar in the case of linear involutions . if we want to study the rauzy - veech induction as a dynamical system on the space of interval exchange maps , it is useful to consider the rauzy - veech renormalisation on the projective space of lengths parameters space . the natural associated object is the renormalized rauzy - veech induction defined on length one intervals : given a permutation , we can define two other permutations with . conversely , any permutation has exactly two predecessors : there exist exactly two permutations and such that . note that is irreducible if and only if is irreducible . thus the relation generated by is a partial order on the set of irreducible permutations ; we represent it as a directed graph . we call rauzy classes the connected components of this graph . the above relation is an equivalence relation on the set of permutations . in particular , the equivalent class of a permutation is the rauzy class . the key remark is the following : if then there exists such that . now assume there exists an oriented path in joining and , i.e. there exist such that . then there exists such that . iterating this argument , there exist such that . thus there is an oriented path in that joins and . we will see that there is an analogous proposition in the case of generalized permutations although the situation is much more complicated . here we describe the construction of a suspension over an interval exchange map , that is a flat surface for which is the first return map of the vertical flow on a well chosen segment . let be an interval exchange transformation . a suspension data for is a collection of vectors such that : 1 . 2 . . 3 . . given a suspension datum , we consider the broken line on defined by concatenation of the vectors ( in this order ) for with starting point at the origin ( see figure ) . similarly , we consider the broken line defined by concatenation of the vectors ( in this order ) for with starting point at the origin . if the lines and have no intersections other than the endpoints , then we can construct a translation surface as follows : we can identify each side on with the side on by a translation ( in the general case , we must use the veech zippered rectangle construction , see section ) . let be the horizontal interval defined by . then the interval exchange map is precisely the one defined by the first return map to of the vertical flow on . we have not yet discussed the existence of such a suspension datum for a general interval exchange map . a necessary condition for to have suspension data is that is irreducible . indeed , if we have such that , and let be a collection of complex numbers , then : so the imaginary part of this number can not be both positive and negative , and is not a suspension data for . if is irreducible , the existence of a suspension data is given by masur and veech independently ( see page 174 and formula page 207 ) . we explain the construction here . first , let us remark that is irreducible if and only if of course if is irreducible , then so is , therefore let us define a collection of complex number as follows : then following and , the collection is a suspension data over . here we describe an alternative construction of the suspension over an interval exchange transformation that works for any suspension data , namely the so called zippered rectangles construction due to veech . let be an interval exchange map , and let us assume that is irreducible . let be any suspension over . then we define by for each let us consider a rectangle of width and of height based on . the zippered rectangle construction is the translation surface where is the following equivalence relation : we identify the top and the bottom of these rectangles by for . then we `` zip '' the vertical boundaries of these rectangles that are adjacent ( see figure ; see also for a more precise description ) . we can define the rauzy - veech induction on the space of suspensions , as well as on the space of zippered rectangles . let be an interval exchange map and let be a suspension over . then we define as follows . we define ( the standard rauzy - veech induction ) . if is the winner for then since is obtained from by `` cutting '' and `` gluing '' , these two surfaces differ by an element of the mapping class group , hence they define the same point in the moduli space ( see figure for an example ) . hence the new suspension data are , , and . ] if is a rauzy class , we define we have thus defined the rauzy - veech map on the space . it is easy to check that it defines an almost everywhere invertible map : if then every has exactly one preimage for . we define the quotient of by the equivalence relation generated by . the zippered rectangle construction , provides a mapping from to a stratum of the moduli space of abelian differentials ( see remark ) . observe that can be calculated in terms of . one can also show that is connected and so the image belongs to a connected component of a stratum . we will denote by the natural lebesgue measure on i.e. , were is the counting measure on and is the lebesgue measure . the mapping preserves , so it induces a measure , denoted again by on . there is natural action of the matrix on by , where acts on linearly . this action preserves the measure on and commutes with , so it descends to a 1-parameter action on called the teichmller flow . since the action of on preserves the area of the corresponding flat surface , the teichmller flow also acts on the subset corresponding to area one surfaces , and preserves the measure induced by the measure on that subset . note also that is a fundamental domain of for the relation and the poincar map of the teichmller flow on latexmath: . moreover the action of is equivariant with respect to , that is . hence if we restrict to area one surfaces , the result of masur and veech ( finiteness of the measure ) implies that the measure is finite on . the renormalized rauzy - veech induction is recurrent on . veech proved a stronger result , that is the ergodicity of ( on the level of for any rauzy class ) , which implies the ergodicity of the teichmller flow for abelian differentials ( see ) . he also proved that the induced measure on is always infinite . let be a ( compact , connected , oriented ) flat surface with linear holonomy and let be a horizontal segment with a choice of a positive vertical direction ( or equivalently , a choice of left and right ends ) . we consider the first return map of vertical geodesics starting from in the positive direction . any vertical geodesic which start from and does nt hit a singularity will intersect again . therefore , the map is well defined outside a finite number of points ( called singular points ) that correspond to vertical geodesics that stop at a singularity before intersecting again the interval . the set is a finite union of open intervals and the restriction of on each of these intervals is of the kind . the map alone does not properly correspond to the dynamics of vertical geodesics since when on the interval , then , and does not correspond to the successive intersections of a vertical geodesic with starting from . to fix this problem , we have to consider the first return map of the vertical geodesics starting from in the negative direction . now if then the successive intersections with of the vertical geodesic starting from will be we get a dynamical system on . following danthony and nogueira ( see ) we will call such a dynamical system a linear involution . we recall here the definition that we have restricted to our purpose . let be an open interval and let be two disjoint copies of . a linear involution on is a map , where : * is a smooth involution without fixed point defined on , where is a finite subset of . * if and belong to the same connected component of then the derivative of at is otherwise the derivative of at is . * is the involution . in this paper , we are interested with non oriented measured foliations defined on oriented surfaces . observe that the orientability of the surface forces the second condition on the derivative of in definition . the previous definition is motivated by the following remark . the first return map of the vertical geodesic foliation on a horizontal segment in a flat surface defines a linear involution in the following way . choose a positive vertical direction in a neighborhood of , and replace be two copies of as in figure . we denote by the one on the top and by the one on the bottom . then we consider the first return map on of vertical geodesics , where a geodesic starting from is taken in the positive vertical direction , and a geodesic starting from is taken in the negative direction . we obtain a map and it is easy to check that satisfies the condition of definition . then it is clear that the map encodes the successive intersections of a vertical geodesic with . recall that interval exchange maps are encoded by combinatorial and metric data : these are a permutation and a vector with positive entries . we define an analogous object for linear involutions . let be an alphabet of letters . a generalized permutation of type , with , is a two - to - one map . we will usually represent such generalized permutation by the table : a generalized permutation defines an involution without fixed points by the following way note that a permutation defines in a natural way a generalized permutation . we now describe how a linear involution naturally defines a generalized permutation . let be a linear involution and let be the corresponding involution as in definition . the domain of definition of is a finite union of open intervals , where are subintervals of and are subintervals of . since is an isometric involution without fixed point , each is mapped isometrically to a , with , hence induces an involution without fixed point on . as in section , we choose a name to each pair and we get a generalized permutation in the sense of the above definition which is defined up to a one - to - one map of . in view of figure , let us consider the following alphabet with . then we define a generalized permutation as follows . in an equivalent way , we can define an involution without fixed point in order to define . we represent by the following table one can check that the discrete datum associated to the linear involution described in figure is the generalized permutation . note that is a `` true '' permutation on letters if and only if and for any , . in this case ( if ) : conversely , let be a generalized permutation of type and let be the associated involution . if is not a `` true '' permutation , then an obvious necessary and sufficient condition for to come from a linear involution is that there exist at least two indices and such that and . from now , unless explicitly stated ( in particular in section ) , we will always assume that generalized permutations will satisfy the following convention . there exist at least two indices and such that and . let be a collection of positive real numbers such that it is easy to construct a linear involution on the interval with combinatorial data . as in section , we will denote by a linear involution . we recall the rauzy - veech induction on linear involutions introduced by danthony and nogueira ( see p. 473 ) . let be a linear involution on , with of type . if , then the rauzy - veech induction of is the linear involution obtained by the first return map of to as in the case of interval exchange maps , the combinatorial data of the new linear involution depends only on the combinatorial data of and whether or . as before , we say that has type or type respectively . the corresponding combinatorial operations are denoted by for respectively . note that if is a given generalized permutation , the subsets and can be empty because or because of the linear relation on the that must be satisfied . we first describe the combinatorial rauzy operations . let be the associated involution to . 1 . map . + if and if then we define to be of type and such that : if , and if there exists a pair included in then we define to be of type and such that : otherwise is not defined . . + if and if then we define to be of type such that : if and if there exists a pair included in then is of type and : otherwise is not defined . we now describe the rauzy - veech induction of : * if has type , then , with if and . * if has type , then , with if and . let us consider the permutation of example , namely . then let us consider the permutation defined on the alphabet by . then and is not defined . indeed , consider any linear involution with as combinatorial data . then we must have therefore we necessarily have and never happens . consider the permutation defined on the alphabet by . then is not defined for any . indeed , consider any linear involution with as combinatorial data . then we must have , hence the rauzy - veech induction of is not defined for any parameters . in the case of interval exchange maps , one usually define the rauzy - veech induction only for irreducible combinatorial data . here we have not yet defined irreducibility . however , it will appear in section that some interesting phenomena with respect to rauzy - veech induction appear also in the reducible case . in the next section we will define a notion of irreducibility which is equivalent to have a suspension data . it is easy to see that a generalized permutation such that neither nor is defined is necessarily reducible . however , the permutation of example is irreducible ( see definition and theorem ) while is not defined . starting from a linear involution , we want to construct a flat surface and a horizontal segment whose corresponding first return maps of the vertical foliation give . such surface will be called a suspension over , and the parameters encoding this construction will be called suspension data . let be a linear involution and let be the lengths of the corresponding intervals . let be a collection of complex numbers such that : 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . . the collection is called a suspension data over . we will also speak in an obvious manner of a suspension data for a generalized permutation . let be a broken line ( with a finite number of edges ) on the plane such that the edge number is represented by the complex number , for , and be a broken line that starts on the same point as , and whose edge number is represented by the complex number for ( figure ) . if and only intersect on their endpoints , then and define a polygon whose sides comes by pairs and for each pair the corresponding sides are parallel and have the same length . then identifying these sides together , one gets a flat surface . it is easy to check that the first return map of the vertical foliation on the segment corresponding to in defines the same linear involution as , so we have constructed a suspension over . we will say in this case that defines a suitable polygon . the broken lines and might intersect at other points ( see figure ) . however , we can still define a flat surface by using an analogous construction as the zippered rectangles construction . we now give a sketch of this construction ( see e.g. for the case of interval exchange maps , or section ) . this construction is very similar to the usual one , although its precise description is very technical . still , for completeness , we give an equivalent but rather implicit formulation . we first consider the previous case when and define a suitable polygon . for each pair of interval on , the return time of the vertical foliation starting from and returning in is constant . this value depends only on the generalized permutation and on the imaginary part of the suspension data . there is a natural embedding of the open rectangle into the flat surface and this surface is obtained from by identifications on the boundaries of the . identifications for the horizontal sides $ ] are given by the linear involution and identifications for the vertical sides only depend on the generalized permutation and of . . ] for the general case , we construct the rectangles using the same formulas . identifications for the horizontal sides are straightforward . identifications for the vertical sides , that do not depends on the horizontal parameters , will be well defined after the following lemma . let be a suspension data for a linear involution , and let be the corresponding generalized permutation . there exists a linear involution and a suspension data for such that : * the generalized permutation associated to is . * for any the complex numbers and have the same imaginary part . * the suspension data defines a suitable polygon . we can assume that ( the negative case is analogous and there is nothing to prove when the sum is zero ) . it is clear that otherwise there would be no possible suspension data . if , then we can shorten the real part of , keeping conditions ( 1)(4 ) satisfied , and get a suspension data with the same imaginary part as , and such that . this last condition implies that defines a suitable polygon . if , then condition implies that is necessary bigger than . however , we can still change into a suspension data , with same imaginary part , and such that is very close to . in that case , also defines a suitable polygon . see , lemma 2.1 for more details . we have therefore defined the zippered rectangle construction for any suspension data . note that we have not yet discussed the existence of a suspension data . this will be done in the upcoming section . this notion is natural . see and the following proposition . let be a flat surface with no vertical saddle connections and let be a horizontal interval attached to a singularity on the left . let be the vertical leaf passing through the right endpoint of , we assume that meets a singularity before returning to , in positive or negative direction . let be the linear involution given by the cross section on of the vertical flow . there exists a suspension data such that defines a surface isometric to . see the construction given in the proof of proposition in . we can define the rauzy - veech induction on the space of suspensions , as well as on the space of zippered rectangles . let be a linear involution and let be a suspension over . then we define as follows . * if has type , then , with if and . * if has type , then , with if and . we can show that is a suspension over and defines a surface isometric to the one corresponding to . as in the case of interval exchange maps we consider the renormalized rauzy - veech induction defined on lengths one intervals : one can define obviously the corresponding renormalized rauzy - veech induction on the suspensions data by contracting the imaginary parts by a factor which preserves the area of the corresponding flat surface . in this section we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a generalized permutation to admit a suspension ; this will prove the first part of theorem . let us first introduce some notations to make clear the definition . notation : if is an alphabet , we will denote by the set with multiplicities of cardinal , and we will use analogous notations for subsets of . we will also call top ( respectively bottom ) the restriction of a generalized permutation to ( respectively ) where is the type of . notation : let be ( possibly empty ) unordered subsets of or . we say that a generalized permutation of type is decomposed if and there exist and such that * * * * . the sets , and will be referred as top - left , top - right , bottom - left and bottom - right corners respectively . we do not assume that , or . we will say that is reducible if admits a decomposition where the subsets are not all empty and one of the following statements holds 1 . no corner is empty 2 . exactly one corner is empty and it is on the left . 3 . exactly two corners are empty and they are either both on the left , either both on the right . a permutation that is not reducible is irreducible . the main result of this section is the next theorem which , being combined with proposition implies first part of theorem . we make clear that in this section , we only speak of suspensions given by the construction of section . let be a linear involution . then admits a suspension if and only if the underlying generalized permutation is irreducible . note that the existence or not of a suspension is independent of the length data . one can see that this reducibility notion is not symmetric with respect to the left / right , contrary to the case of interval exchange maps . therefore , the choice of attaching a singularity on the left end of the segment in the construction of section is a real choice . this will have an important consequence in terms of extended rauzy classes . in the usual case of interval exchange maps , one can always choose in such a way that ( i.e. there is a singularity on the left and on the right of the interval ) . here it is not always possible . more precisely one can show that admits such a suspension with this extra condition if and only if for any decomposition of as in equation above , all the corners are empty . a reducible generalized permutation does not admit any suspension data . let us consider a reducible generalized permutation . it is convenient to introduce some notations . let us assume that there exists a suspension over . then we define the real number ; we define if the set is empty . finally we define , and in an analogous manner for and . we also define . we distinguish three cases following definition . i- no corner is empty . + then the following inequalities hold subtracting the second one from the first one , and the fourth one from the third one , we get : which is a contradiction . ii- exactly one corner is empty , and it is on the left . + we can assume without loss of generality that it is the top - left one . that means that , are empty , and , are nonempty . therefore the following inequalities holds : subtracting the third inequality from the second one , we get , which contradicts the first one . iii- exactly two corners are empty . + if they are both on the left side , then we have and empty and non empty . this implies that is both positive and negative , which is impossible . + if they are both on the right side , it is similar . if the two corners forming a diagonal were empty , then it is easy to see that all the corners would be empty , hence this case does nt occur by assumption . the proposition is proven . in this section , we will not necessarily assume that generalized permutations satisfy convention , since for technical reasons , some intermediary results of this section must be stated for an arbitrary generalized permutation . we will have to work only on the imaginary part of the in order to built a suspension . hence , in order to simplify the notations we will use the following ones . we will use this vocabulary only in this section . a pseudo - suspension is a collection of real numbers such that : * for all . * for all . * a pseudo - suspension is strict if all the previous inequalities are strict except for the extremal ones . a vanishing index on the top ( respectively bottom ) of a pseudo - suspension is an integer ( respectively ) such that ( respectively ) . a pseudo - suspension is better than if the set of vanishing indices of is strictly included into the set of vanishing indices of . we will say that is strongly irreducible if for any decomposition of as in of definition , all the corners are empty . of course strong irreducibility implies irreducibility . the following lemma is obvious and left to the reader . let be generalized permutation satisfying convention that admits a strict pseudo - suspension . then admits a suspension with . let us assume that is any irreducible permutation . one has to find a suspension over . we will first assume that is strongly irreducible and we will show that admits such a suspension with the extra equality . this corresponds to a special case of proposition . we will then relax the condition on the irreducibility of and prove our main result . note that one can extend the proof of proposition to show that if is a suspension data such that , then is strongly irreducible . from lemma we have reduced the problem to the construction of a strict pseudo - suspension . as we have seen in section , in the case of true permutations , there is an explicit formula , due to masur and veech , that gives a suspension when the permutation is irreducible . we will first build a pseudo - suspension by extending this formula to generalized permutations . this will not give in general a strict pseudo - suspension . let be a generalized permutation . we can decompose into three disjoint subsets * the subset of elements such that contains exactly one element in and one element in . the restriction of on defines a true permutation . * the subset of elements such that contains exactly two elements in ( and hence no elements in ) . * the subset of elements such that contains exactly two elements in ( and hence no elements in ) . the next lemma is just a reformulation of the construction of a suspension data in section let be a true permutation defined on , then the integers for define a pseudo - suspension over . furthermore , we have : recall that we do not assume any more that a generalized permutation satisfies convention . let be a generalized permutation of type and the associated involution . there exists a collection of real numbers with for all and such that we will construct from a new permutation on symbols . let us consider the `` mirror symmetry '' of as follows . in tabular representation is ; is of type and its tabular representation is . then is in tabular representation with is obtained from by removing the second occurrence of each letter . for instance , if then and . it is easy to check that is reducible if and only if there exists such that . moreover the solution of lemma gives the desired collection of numbers . we define the pseudo - suspension over by the collection of real numbers given by * the solutions given by lemma and lemma for the restrictions of on and on . * the solution of lemma for the restriction of on , taken with opposite sign . let be any vanishing index on the top of . setting and , there exists and such that the generalized permutation decomposes as with and with one of the following properties : either or there exist such that and . there is an analogous decomposition for vanishing indices in but with different subsets , and a priory . it follows from lemmas and . if is a pseudo - suspension of then is a pseudo - suspension of and is a pseudo - suspension of the generalized permutation . + hence we can `` flip '' the generalized permutation by top / bottom or left / right without loss of generality . in the next two lemmas , we denote by a pseudo - suspension that is better than and maximal ( i.e. there is no better pseudo - suspensions ) . let and be the two first top and bottom vanishing indices for ( possibly ) . let and . then either or or . better than .,title=\"fig : \" ] we assume that neither nor is empty . lemma implies that one of this set is a subset of the other one . without loss of generality , we can assume that . let us assume ; we will get a contradiction . so there exist in such that . but by definition of and , we also have . the definition of implies that there exists such that , for , the following inequality holds : now we replace ( respectively ) by ( respectively ) and get a vector , see figure . we have * for . * for . * for . * for ( since ) . hence , is a pseudo - suspension better than , contradicting its maximality . therefore and the lemma is proven . let and be the first and last top vanishing indices of . let and . then either or or . moreover if there exist in such that then . we sketch the proof here . we assume that there exist and in such that . if there exists such that , then we set : then is is easy to see that , for small enough , is a pseudo - suspension and is better than , contradicting its maximality . remark implies that the same statement is true for ; hence , we can assume that . we conclude using the same argument as the one of the proof of the previous lemma . let be a strongly irreducible generalized permutation . let be any pseudo - suspension which is better than and maximal . then is a strict pseudo - suspension . let us assume that is not strict . from lemmas and and remark we have the following decomposition of . with , and by assumption , and with the condition that either are equal , or at least one of them is empty ( and similar statement for the pair ) ; and the condition that if then they are either equal , or at least one of them is empty , otherwise one of them is ( and similar statements for ) . by convention from now on , we will keep the notation or only when they are not equal to or , and therefore subsets of or . let us note that if there is no vanishing index in or in , the corresponding right corner is just empty . but if is not strict , then there exists at least a pair of nonempty corners in the top or in the bottom . if there is a vanishing index on the top , then the two corresponding corners are non - empty . then it is easy to see that either there is a corner with only or , or the corners are respectively or , with nonempty . in this case lemma implies that there must be a vanishing index in . since there must be a vanishing index in the top , or in the bottom , the previous argument implies that either is not strongly irreducible , or there is one corner that only consists of one set or . thanks to remark , we assume that this is the top - left corner ; this leads to the two next cases . the general idea of the next part of the proof is first to remove the cases that correspond to not strongly irreducible permutations , and then show that the other cases correspond to a non - maximal pseudo - solution . first case : the top - left corner is . + there is necessary a vanishing index in , and hence the top - right corner is not empty . it also does not contains all , hence it is necessary , or . recall that is assumed to be strongly irreducible , so the top - right corner is not . if the bottom - right corner were , the generalized permutation would decompose as or which are not strongly irreducible . hence the bottom - right corner is not . this also implies that can not be empty . let us assume that there are no vanishing indices in the bottom line . we choose any element , , and and change by , by and by . if is small enough , then the new vector is better than , which contradicts its maximality . so , the bottom admits vanishing indices ; then the bottom - left corner can be or . let us discuss these cases in details . * : the bottom - right corner is , or . in the first and second cases , is not strongly irreducible . if for instance , the top - right is , then decomposes as and therefore is not strongly irreducible . the other case is similar . * or : in that case , the bottom - right corner is necessary and we have already proved that is not strongly irreducible in this situation . * or : we construct a better pseudo - suspension . + let be the smallest index such that and let be the largest one . let be the first vanishing index . there exists such that otherwise the top - line would have a decomposition as , and would be not strongly irreducible . let be the first index in ( see figure ) . + now we define in the following way : in the extremal case , the following arguments will work similarly if we define by . we have here is the difference between the number of indices in smaller than or equal to , and number of indices in smaller than or equal to . this value is always greater than or equal to zero for , and is strictly greater than zero when is the first vanishing index . + similarly is the difference between the number of indices in that are in , and number of indices in that are in . this value might be positive . let be respectively the first and last bottom vanishing indices . we have the following facts : * * otherwise the bottom - left corner is . * * otherwise the bottom - right corner is . + hence it is easy to check that can be strictly positive only for or . + then if is small enough , is a pseudo - suspension , and is better than ( see figure ) , which contradicts the maximality of . better than . ] second case : the top - left corner is . + we assume that there are no corners or , since this case has already been discussed . let us assume that there is no vanishing index in the bottom line . then , according to lemma , ; therefore the top - right corner is or . if is empty , then decomposes as so is not strongly irreducible . if is not empty , we choose any element , , , and replace by , by , and by . this new pseudo - suspension we have constructed is better that the old one for small enough . if there are vanishing indices in the bottom , then the bottom - left corner belongs to the list : or . * : the permutation is then obviously not strongly irreducible . * : the bottom - right corner is necessary or . if the top - right corner where , then would be not strongly irreducible . in particular , that means is not empty . hence there exists such that and . then we choose any index and any index , and set : then is better than for small enough , which contradicts its maximality . * , or . the bottom - right corner is necessary . if is empty , then the top - right corner is also , and therefore is not strongly irreducible . if is not empty , then we choose , and , and set : and is better than . the proposition is proved . we now have all necessary tools for proving our main result . we only have to prove the sufficient condition . we consider a pseudo - suspension better than and maximal for this property . we can assume that is not strongly irreducible ( i.e. at least one corner is non empty in the decomposition ) otherwise the theorem follows from lemma and proposition . let us consider a decomposition of as where is maximal . note that defines a generalized permutation which is not strongly irreducible by assumption . note also that does not necessary satisfy convention , even if satisfies that convention . we define ; from proposition , the restriction of to is strict for . since is irreducible , there is one or two empty corners in the decomposition . * if only one corner is empty , then it is on the right . so we can assume that decomposes as : with strongly irreducible . + let be the first vanishing index in the top line of and be the first vanishing index of the second line . consider the first index such that . then otherwise there would be a subdecomposition of as and would be reducible . now let and let . we set : if is small enough , then satisfies : * * for all . * * for all . + and then , we can deduce from a suspension over . * if two corner are empty , then we can assume that decomposes as : with irreducible . now we choose and , and then set : then defines a suspension over for small enough . the theorem is proven . for an interval exchange map either the underlying permutation is reducible and then the transformation is never minimal or is irreducible and has the keane s property ( and hence is minimal ) for almost every ( see section ) . furthermore admits a suspension if and only if is irreducible . + hence the combinatorial set for which the dynamics of is good coincides with the one for which the geometry is good . as we will see , the situation is more complicated in the general case . in this section we prove theorem and the second half of theorem . a linear involution has a connection ( of length ) if there exist and such that * is a singularity for . * is a singularity for . a linear involution with no connection is said to have the keane s property . note that , by definition of a singularity , if we have a connection of length starting from , then is not a singularity for . we first prove the following proposition : let be a linear involution . the following statements are equivalent . 1 . satisfies the keane s property . is well defined for any and the lengths of the intervals tends to as tends to infinity . moreover in the above situation the transformation is minimal . we denote by the length parameters of the map , by , , the combinatorial data , and by the subinterval of corresponding to . let us assume that has no connection . then all the iterates of by the rauzy - veech induction are well defined . indeed it is easy to see that has the keane s property if and only if its image by the rauzy - veech induction is well defined and has the keane s property . hence if has the keane s property , then by induction , all its iterates by are well defined and have the keane s property . now we have to prove that goes to zero as tends to infinity . let be the subset of elements such that decreases an infinite number of time in the sequence , and let be its complement . repeating the arguments for the proposition and corollary 1 and 2 of section 4.3 in , we have that : * for large enough , the permutation can be written as : with * for all , tends to zero . if , then the proposition is proven . so we can assume that is a strict subset of . note that can not be empty . therefore , we must have for some and . this means that has a connection of length zero , hence has a connection . this contradicts the hypothesis . so we have proven that if has no connections , then the sequence of iterates of by the rauzy - veech induction is infinite and all length parameters of tend to zero when tends to infinity . now we assume that has a connection . so , there exists in which is a singularity of , and such that its sequence of iterates by is finite , with a singularity of . we denote by the projections of on . let be the element of whose corresponding projection to is minimal . we have . if for all , the map is well defined and , then does not tend to zero , and hence there exists such that does not tend to zero . hence we can assume that there exists a maximal such that is well defined , and contains . we want to show that is not defined . assume that is defined , then . since is an acceleration of , there must exists an iterate of by , say which is a singularity for . either is in , either it is its right end . however , does not contain , and . therefore , we must have , so is a singularity for . we prove in the same way that is also a singularity for . this implies that we are precisely in the case when the rauzy - veech induction is not defined . hence we have proven that if has a connection , then either the sequence is finite , either the length parameters do not all tend to zero . this proves the first part of the proposition . now let be a linear involution on satisfying the keane s property . recall that is defined on the set . let us consider the first return map on . by definition of , one has for each some return time such that . but is piecewise linear thus for any in a small neighborhood of , the return time . since the derivative of is if and belong to the same connected component and otherwise , the derivative of is necessary . hence is an interval exchange map . obviously has no connexion since it is an acceleration of , hence is minimal . similarly , the first return map of on is also minimal . since satisfies convention , any orbit of is dense on and therefore is minimal . the proof is complete . let be a linear involution . we will say that is admissible for ( or has admissible parameters ) if none of the following assertions holds : 1 . decomposes as + with and non empty in the two first cases . there is a decomposition of as , with ( up to switching the top and the bottom of ) and the length parameters satisfy the following inequality a generalized permutation will be called dynamically irreducible if the corresponding set of admissible parameters is nonempty . the set of admissible parameters of a generalized permutation is always open . these two combinatorial notions of reducibility were introduced by the second author ( see ) . observe that if is not admissible for , then have a connection of length or depending on cases or of definition , and is never minimal . more precisely there exist two invariant sets of positive measure . + one can also note that if is irreducible then is dynamically irreducible ( the set of admissible parameters being the entire parameters space ) . the length parameters for can not be linearly independent over since they must satisfy a nontrivial relation with integer coefficients . a linear involution is said to have irrational parameters if generates a -vector space of dimension . almost all linear involutions have irrational parameters , and this property is preserved by the rauzy - veech induction . if is dynamical reducible , the non minimality comes from remark . conversely let us assume that is a dynamical irreducible permutation and let be a linear involution with irrational parameters and admissible for . we still denote by the length parameters of and by , , the combinatorial data . the proof has two steps : first we show using proposition that if does not have the keane s property , then there exists such that does not have admissible parameter ( case of definition ) . then we show that in this case is not admissible for . this will imply the theorem . first step : we assume that the sequence is finite . then there exists that admits no rauzy - veech induction . since is irrational then either , or belongs to the only pair on the top of the permutation and belongs to the only pair on the bottom of the permutation . in each case , does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . now we assume that the lengths parameters do not all tend to zero . as in the proof of proposition , for large enough , the generalized permutation decomposes as : with , for some and some and . recall that the map has irrational parameters , therefore must decompose as : so does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . second step : it is enough to prove that if does not have admissible parameter , then so is . we can assume without loss of generality that the combinatorial rauzy - veech transformation is . we denote by the data of and by the data of . if decomposes as : let us consider the last element of the top line . its twin is on the bottom - right corner , but is not . we denote by . then it is clear that we obtain by removing from that place and putting it at the right - end of the bottom line . then does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . now we assume that decomposes as : if is on the bottom line , the situation is analogous to the previous case . if not , then we denote by and , and we get by removing from and putting it on the right - end of the bottom line . if this place is in the top - right corner , then clearly , does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . however , it might be the last element of the top - left corner . in that case , setting , the generalized permutation decomposes as : with and , hence does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . now we assume that decomposes as then we obtain from by removing an element on the top - left corner or on the bottom - right corner , and putting it at the right - end of the bottom line . then does not have admissible parameter ( case ) . the other cases are similar . as we have seen previously , there are two notions of irreducibility for a linear involution . * `` geometrical irreducibility '' as stated in section , that we just called irreducibility . * dynamical irreducibility as stated in section . in this section , we first prove that the set of irreducible linear involutions in an attractor for the renormalized rauzy - veech induction . then we show that ( analogously to the case of interval exchange transformations ) the renormalized rauzy - veech induction is recurrent for almost all irreducible linear involutions . we can find a non - zero pseudo - suspension ( see definition ) otherwise it is easy to show that does not have admissible parameter ( case ( 1 ) ) . for all , we denote by the complex number . then , as in section , we consider a broken line which starts at , and whose edge number is represented by the complex number , for . then we consider a broken line , which starts on the same point as , and whose edge number is represented by the complex number for . is the first return map of the vertical foliation on a union of saddle connections . ] special case : we assume that and only intersect on their endpoints . then they define a flat surface , and appears as a first return map of the vertical foliation on a segment which is a union of horizontal saddle connections ( see figure ) . after steps of the rauzy - veech induction , the resulting linear involution is the first return map of the vertical flow of on a shorter segment , which is adjacent to the same singularity as . since has no connection , then the length of tends to zero when tends to infinity by the first part of proposition . hence for large enough , is the first return map of the vertical flow of on a segment , adjacent to a singularity , and with no singularities in its interior . with our construction of , it is clear that any vertical saddle connection would intersect and would give a connexion on . since has no connection , the surface has no vertical saddle connection ( note that this is not true in general for a first return map on a transverse segment ) . according to proposition , admits a suspension and hence theorem implies that is irreducible . the theorem is proven for that case . as a first return map on a regular segment of a surface . ] general case : the two broken lines and might have other intersection points . we first show this still defines a flat surface . we consider the line that starts at the complex number . then we join the first points of and by a vertical segment , and do the same for their ends points ( see figure ) . this defines a polygon and the non vertical sides come by pairs , so we can glue them as previously . there are two vertical segments left . we decompose each vertical segment into a pair of vertical segments of the same length and glue them together ( see the figure ) . this creates a pole for each initial segment . we denote by the resulting flat surface . the first return map of the vertical flow on the horizontal segment joining the two poles is . the surface has two vertical saddle connections of length starting from the poles , but there is no other vertical saddle connection on since has no connections . when tends to zero , the two vertical saddle connections are the only ones that shrink to zero . hence there is no loop that shrink to zero . furthermore , the initial pseudo - suspension is nonzero , so the area of is bounded from below . hence , the surface does not degenerate when tends to zero and so there exists a sequence that tends to zero such that tends to a surface . the segment corresponding to the limit of , as tends to infinity , might be very complicated and the first return map on is not well defined . the transformation is the first return map of the vertical flow of on a shortest horizontal segment , adjacent to one of the poles . if is large enough , then the segment corresponding to the limit of has no singularity on its interior . since the surgery corresponding to contracting does not change the the vertical foliation , the first return map of the vertical foliation of on is precisely . as in the special case , the surface does not have any vertical saddle connection , so the generalized permutation corresponding to is irreducible and the proposition is proven . the following lemma is analogous to proposition 9.1 in . let be a linear involution on with no connection and let be a singularity for . let be the subinterval corresponding to the linear involution . there exists such that . since has no connection , there exists a first such that . so , and is still a singularity for . we obtain from by considering the first return map on the largest subinterval whose right endpoint corresponds to a singularity of . so . let be an irreducible generalized permutation , and let be the set of generalized permutations that can be obtained by iterations of the maps and ( when possible ) . we define . we have defined the rauzy - veech map on the space . it defines an almost everywhere invertible map : if then has exactly one preimage for . we define the quotient of by the equivalence relation generated by . one will denote by the natural lebesgue measure on i.e. , where is the natural lebesgue measure on the hyperplane , and is the counting measure . the mapping preserves , so it induces a measure , again denoted by on . the matrix acts on by , where acts on linearly . this action preserves the measure on and commutes with , so it descends to a measure preserving flow on called the teichmller flow . if is a suspension data , we denote by the length of the corresponding interval , i.e. . the subset is a fundamental domain of for the relation and the first return map of the teichmller flow on is the renormalized rauzy - veech induction on suspensions . the zippered rectangle construction provides a finite covering from to a subset of full measure in a connected component of a stratum of the moduli space of quadratic differentials . the degree of this cover is where is the dimension of the stratum . moreover ( is the genus of the surfaces ) . let be a ( generic ) flat surface in with no vertical and no horizontal saddle connection . consider a horizontal separatrix adjacent to a given singularity . we call admissible a segment adjacent to , such that the vertical geodesic passing through the right endpoint of meets a singularity before returning to , in positive or negative direction . then proposition implies that there exists a corresponding suspension datum such that . conversely , any such that is obtained by this construction . now let be two admissible segments , and let be the corresponding suspension data . one can assume without loss of generality that and their left endpoint is the singularity . let be the linear involutions corresponding to . the right endpoint of corresponds to a singularity of . hence there exists such that , and therefore . so we have proven that for each separatrix adjacent to a singularity , there is only one preimage of by the mapping . so is a finite covering . the degree of is obvious by construction . if is the number of possible choices of horizontal separatrices then the degree of is ( choices of labels and the choice of the intervals ) . for each singularity , one has separatrices . thus the proposition is proven . the subset corresponding to surfaces of area 1 is a finite ramified cover of a connected component of a stratum of quadratic differentials , and the corresponding lebesgue measures are proportional . by theorem 0.2 in the volume of the moduli space of quadratic differentials is finite , and so , has finite measure . hence the teichmller geodesic flow on is recurrent for the lebesgue measure . recall that the rauzy - veech renormalization for suspensions is the cross section of the teichmller geodesic flow on ; therefore the rauzy - veech renormalization for suspension is recurrent . we have , and the rauzy - veech induction commutes with the projection . so , for almost all parameters , the sequence is recurrent . note that the proof of theorem does not use the fact that a linear involution satisfying the keane s property is minimal . we can use this theorem to give an alternative proof of the minimality of such map . let be a linear involution with the keane s property . from theorem , there exists such that is the cross section of the vertical foliation on a flat surface with no vertical saddle connection . any infinite vertical geodesic on such a surface is dense ( see e.g. ) . thus is minimal and so is . as we have seen previously , the irreducible generalized permutations are an attractor for the rauzy - veech induction . in this section , we prove that there is no smaller attractor . we also prove theorem . we first define the rauzy classes and then the extended rauzy classes . given a permutation , we can define at most two other permutations with when is well defined . the relation generates a partial order on the set of generalized permutations ; we represent it as a directed graph , and as for permutations , we will call rauzy classes the connected components of this graph . in the case of interval exchanges , the periodicity of the maps and gives an easy proof of the fact that the above relation is an equivalence relation ( proposition of section ) . here the argument fails because these maps are not always defined , and it may happen that is well defined , but not . however , the corresponding statement is still true . the above partial order is an equivalence relation on the set of irreducible generalized permutations . let and be two generalized permutations . assume that there is a sequence of maps and that sends to . if , then for any parameters , there exist parameters such that . iterating this argument , there exists and such that . but for any in a sufficiently small neighborhood of , the generalized permutation corresponding to is . recall that renormalized rauzy - veech induction map is recurrent ( theorem ) thus one can find such that the sequence come back in a neighborhood of infinitely many time . furthermore , . thus gives a sequence of generalized permutations that reach and then reach . so , it gives a combination of the maps and that sends to . this proves the proposition . let . we define the symmetric permutation of by . if is a generalized permutation of type defined over an alphabet of letters , we define the generalized permutation to be of type by we start from an irreducible generalized permutation and we construct the subset of irreducible generalized permutation that can be obtained from by some composition of the maps , and . the quotient of this set by the equivalence relation generated by for any bijective map from onto is called the extended rauzy class of . the quotient by the equivalence relation generated by means that we look at generalized permutations defined up to renumbering . this is needed for technical reasons in the proof of theorem . in opposite to the case of interval exchange maps , the definition of irreducibility we gave in section is not invariant by the map : for instance , the generalized permutation is irreducible while is reducible . so an extended rauzy class is obtained after considering the set of generalized permutations obtained from by the extended rauzy operations , and intersecting this set by irreducible generalized permutations . the results from the previous section shows that our definition of irreducibility is the good one with respect to the rauzy - veech induction , but we see that the convention of the `` left - end singularity '' is a real choice . let be a linear involution defined on an interval . recall that rauzy - veech induction applied on consists in considering the first return map on , where is the maximal element of that corresponds to a singularity of . in terms of generalized permutation , this corresponds to the mapping . one can consider the first return map of on the interval , where is the minimal element of that corresponds to a singularity of . in terms of generalized permutations , this corresponds to the the conjugaison of map . we will call this the `` rauzy - veech induction of by cutting on the left of '' , while the usual rauzy - veech induction will on the opposite called the `` rauzy - veech induction of by cutting on the right of '' . let be an irreducible generalized permutation . the corresponding set of suspension data is connected ( even convex ) , so the set of surfaces constructed from a suspension data , using the zippered rectangle construction , belongs to a connected component of the moduli space of quadratic differentials . it is also open and invariant by the action of the teichmller geodesic flow , hence it is a subset of full measure by ergodicity . let be a generalized permutation that corresponds to the same connected component of the moduli space . then there exists a surface and two segments and , each one being adjacent to a singularity and , such that for each , the linear involution given by the first return maps on has combinatorial data . we can assume that has no vertical saddle connection . we recall that each has an orientation so that the corresponding singularity is in its left end . consider the vertical separatrix starting from , in the positive direction and let be its first intersection point with . applying the usual rauzy - veech induction for , the map is a first return map of the vertical flow on a subinterval , adjacent to . if is large enough , then is isomorphic to the first return map on the subinterval , of the same length as . we assume first that , hence this first return map is consistent with the positive direction on . we now have to apply rauzy - veech inductions ( on the right and on the left ) on until we get a first return map on with corresponding generalized permutation . since is by construction , up to renumbering the alphabet , in the same rauzy class as , we will therefore find some composition of the maps , that send to . note that might not correspond a priory to some singularities of , so naive rauzy - veech induction on might miss the interval . but or is a singularity , so we can cut the interval on the left until is the left end , this will eventually occurs because of lemma . then after cutting on the right will become the right end of the corresponding interval . if , then similarly , by cutting on the right and then on the left , we get two linear involutions corresponding to first returns maps that only differ by a different choice of orientation . hence we have found some composition of the maps , that send to some , such that is in the same rauzy class as . hence we have proved that if two irreducible generalized permutations correspond to the same connected component , then they are in the same extended rauzy class . to prove the converse , we must consider a slightly more general kind of suspensions that do not necessary corresponds to a singularity on the left . the corresponding `` extended '' suspension data satisfy 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . for some ( the case corresponds to suspension data as seen previously ) . then we can extend the zippered rectangle construction to these extended suspension data . as in the usual case , the space of extended suspension data corresponding to a generalized permutation is convex , so the set of surfaces corresponding to a given generalized permutation belong to a connected component of stratum . then it is easy to see that if is obtained from by the map , or , then the corresponding connected component is the same . historically , extended rauzy classes have been used to prove the non connectedness of some stratum of abelian differentials ( see for instance ) . for this case , some topological invariants were found by kontsevich and zorich ( hyperellipticity and spin structure ) . for the case of quadratic differentials , all non - connected components ( except four special

for the stratum one can consider the generalized permutations for the stratum one can consider the generalized permutations for the stratum one can consider the generalized permutations the theorem is proven . here we give explicit examples of reduced rauzy classes ( i.e. up to the equivalence , for any permutation of ) . it is easy to see that there is only one rauzy class filled by ( irreducible ) generalized permutations defined over letters . in that case the rauzy class contains generalized permutations and a permutation is irreducible if and only if it is dynamically irreducible . thus there is no interesting phenomenon in this `` simple '' case . if we consider a slightly more complicated case , for instance permutations defined over letters we get some interesting phenomenon . figure illustrates such a rauzy class . it corresponds to the stratum . the generalized permutations and are not formally in the rauzy class since they are reducible , but we can see there is concretely the `` attraction '' phenomenon . as we can see the ( reduced ) rauzy classes for generalized permutations are in general much more complicated than the one for usual permutation since the vertex are either of valence one or of valence two . in figure we present a more complicated case with an `` unstable '' set of permutations . we end this section with an explicit calculation of the

that the extended rauzy class has elements . , width=491 ] in section , we have defined an extended rauzy class by considering the set of generalized permutations obtained from an irreducible permutation by the extended rauzy operations . this set is not in general a subset of the irreducible generalized permutations , therefore we must intersect it with the set of irreducible generalized permutations to get an extended rauzy class . one could also define an extended rauzy class in the following way : it is a minimal subset of the irreducible generalized permutations stable by the operations , , and . it is equivalent to say that we forbid the operation for such that is reducible . for the purpose of this section , let us call this new class a weakly extended rauzy class . a priory , an extended rauzy class is a union of weakly extended rauzy classes . we will prove : all we have to prove is that if two irreducible generalized permutations and correspond to the same connected component of a stratum of quadratic differentials , then we can join them ( up to relabelling ) by a combination of the maps , , and , such that all the corresponding intermediary generalized permutations are irreducible . recall that if is irreducible , then so are and ( when defined ) . the idea is now to modify the proof of theorem , by using the three following elementary remarks . let be a suspension datum over an irreducible generalized permutation ( of type ) . 1 . in remark we gave a condition in order to have . equivalently if a decomposition of holds then there is no empty corner . it is obvious to check that , under this condition , is irreducible . 2 . let us assume that the two lines joining the end points of and the end points of do not have any other intersection point with and . then applying to the matrix for a suitable , we get a new suspension data over with . hence is irreducible . 3 . let minimize the value . lemma implies that there exists such that is the first return map of to the subinterval . let us consider . by construction satisfies the previous condition , hence is irreducible . let us now prove the proposition . let and be two generalized permutations in the same extended rauzy class . the proof of theorem asserts that there exists a surface and two segments and , each one being adjacent to a singularity and , such that for each , the linear involution given by the first return maps on has combinatorial datum . we can assume that has no vertical saddle connection . the previous remark implies that , up to replacing by some for some well chosen , one can and do assume that is irreducible . let be the suspension over that corresponds to the surface , then up to applying to the matrix for a suitable ( which does not change the vertical foliation ) , we can assume that . for large enough , is isomorphic to the first return map on a subinterval of , with or a singularity of . let that minimizes the value and let be the corresponding point . if then we also have ( since can be chosen arbitrarily close to ) . we then apply the rauzy - veech induction to until we get a first return map on . if then we also have . by definition is a suspension data over ( i.e. we are `` rotating by '' the polygon and the linear involution ) . we apply the rauzy - veech induction on until we get a a first return map on that contains . the result is a linear involution such that is irreducible , and a suspension over . as before we can assume that and then is a suspension over that corresponds to a first return map of on the subinterval . moreover the sequence of generalized permutations joining to corresponding to our description consists entirely of irreducible elements . iterating this argument , there will be a step where the point minimizing the value is precisely ( because the surface admits a finite number of vertical separatrices starting from the singularities ) . the same argument produces a sequence

{"article": "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period binaries containing a white dwarf ( wd ) primary ( with mass ) and a low mass main sequence secondary ( with mass ) . the secondary fills its roche lobe and transfers mass to the wd through the inner lagrangian  point . the main features of the orbital period distribution of cvs with hydrogen rich donors are the lack of systems in the 2 - 3 hr period range ( the so - called period gap ) and the sharp cut off of the distribution at around 77 minutes , as can be seen in figure ( upper frame ; e.g. ritter & kolb 1998 ) . so far theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short - period cut - off and observed shape of the cv orbital period distribution near this cut - off . this is summarised in figure . systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation ( gr ; kraft et al . 1962 ) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum ( am ) reach a minimum period at minutes ( figure , middle frame ; paczyski 1971 ; kolb & baraffe 1999).the probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region . we thus have n(p ) , for the number of systems found within a given orbital period range around , and is the secular period derivative at this period . we thus expect an accumulation of systems ( a spike ) at where ( figure , lower frame ) , while no such spike is present in the observed distribution ( figure , upper frame ) . the orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor , which in turn is governed by two competing effects . mass transfer perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star . thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius . the minimum period occurs where the two corresponding time scales , the mass transfer time and the thermal ( kelvin - helmholtz ) time are about equal ( e.g. paczyski 1971 ; king 1988 ) . if then the star is able to contract in response to mass loss , but if the star will not shrink rapidly enough and will become oversized for its mass . the position of the minimum period is therefore affected by the assumed mass transfer rate , and in particular by the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum ( am ) losses . in this paper we investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate , and investigate ways to `` hide '' the spike by introducing a spread of values in the cv population . in particular , we study the effect of a form of consequential am loss ( caml ) where the am is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary , i.e. ( see e.g. webbink 1985 ) . in section we outline our general model assumptions and introduce the prescription for caml . in section we present detailed calculations of the long - term evolution of cvs , and in section we compare the observed short period cv period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions based on the calculations in section 2 . in this section we investigate possible solutions to the mismatch between the theoretical and observed minimum orbital period in cvs . the orbital am loss rate of a cv can be written as the sum of two terms , = sys+ caml , where denotes the `` systemic '' am loss rate , such as gravitational wave radiation , that is independent of mass transfer , while is an explicit function of the mass transfer rate . we have = 0 and caml0 20 we consider the general case in which the caml mechanism , along with nova mass ejections , causes a fraction of the transferred mass to leave the system . this fraction may be greater than unity as the primary may lose more mass during a nova outburst than was accreted since the last outburst . we employ a generic prescription of the effect of a caml mechanism , thus avoiding the need to specify its physical nature . possible caml mechanisms include a magnetic propeller , i.e. a system containing a rapidly spinning magnetic wd where some of the transferred material gains angular momentum from the wd spin by interaction with the wd s magnetic field ( see e.g. wynn , king & horne 1997 ) , and an accretion disc wind ( see e.g. livio & pringle 1994 ) . our caml prescription largely follows the notation of king & kolb ( 1995 ) . the am is assumed to be lost via mass loss that is axis - symmetrical with respect to an axis a fixed at the wd centre but perpendicular to the orbital plane . we define as the total fraction of mass lost from the secondary that leaves the system . we assume further that a fraction  of the transferred mass leaves the system with some fraction of the angular momentum it had on leaving the point . we also consider mass that is lost from the system via nova mass ejections , which over the long term can be considered as an isotropic wind from the primary ( see e.g. kolb et al . this material will carry away the specific orbital angular momentum of the primary and will account for the fraction  of the mass loss . we thus obtain caml = b^2 2 + , where we define as the caml efficiency . for comparison with king & kolb ( 1995 ) we equate this to caml = j , > 0 , and obtain = ( 1+q)^2 + . for our calculations shown below we use the approximation 1-+-,^3=. this is an adaptation of the expression given in kopal ( 1959 ) and is accurate to within 1% over the range . in this subsection we present calculations of the long - term evolution of cvs as they approach and evolve beyond the period minimum . for the computations we used the stellar code by mazzitelli ( 1989 ) , adapted to cvs by kolb & ritter ( 1992 ) . some of these evolutionary sequences are the basis for the theoretical cv period distributions we present in section below . we calculated the evolution of individual systems that are subject to caml according to equations and . we chose and initial donor mass , with a range of caml efficiencies as shown in figure . the systems initially evolve from longer periods towards the period bounce ( right to left ) at almost constant mass transfer rate . the minimum period increases with increasing caml efficiency to a maximum of around 70 min for . mass transfer stability sets an upper limit on the caml efficiency . an obvious upper limit is 1 , where all the angular momentum of the transferred material is ejected from the system . although the ejected material may carry more angular momentum than was transferred ( as in the case of a propeller system where additional angular momentum is taken from the spin of the wd ) this does not affect the net loss of orbital angular momentum . the maximum caml efficiency still compatible with mass transfer stability could be smaller than unity . the stability parameter which enters the expression for steady - state mass transfer , equation ( e.g. king & kolb 1995 ) must be greater than zero ; this defines an upper limit on . - 2=m 2  a plot of against for an initially marginally stable system ( , and ) is given in figure . the system initially exhibits cycles of high mass transfer rate ( close to 0 ) and very low mass transfer rate . the high states are short lived , on the order of years ( see figure ) . the system finally stabilizes with . at around starts to decrease further but always remains positive , settling at a value around . the tidal deformation of the secondary may have an effect on the period minimum . calculations by renvoiz , baraffe , kolb & ritter ( 2002 ) , using 3dimensional sph models suggest that the secondary is deformed in the non - spherical roche lobe such that its volume equivalent radius is around 1.06 times that of the same star in isolation . we mimic this effect in our 1-dimensional stellar structure code by multiplying the calculated radius by a deformation factor before the mass transfer rate is determined from the difference between the radius and the roche lobe radius via - 2= 0(- ) . here is the mass transfer rate of a binary in which the secondary just fills its roche potential and is the photospheric pressure scale height of the secondary ( see e.g. ritter 1988 ) . figure shows the effect on the minimum period and mass transfer rate for systems with various deformation factors , ranging from 1 ( no deformation ) to 1.24 . the mass transfer rate is seen to decrease with increasing deformation . this can be understood from the functional dependence on orbital period and donor mass in the usual quadrupole formula for the am loss rate due to gravitational radiation ( see e.g. landau & lifschitz 1958 ) . although the quadrupole formula is strictly valid only if both components are point masses , rezzolla , ury & yoshida ( 2001 ) found that the gr rate obtained using a full 3-dimensional representation of the donor star differs from the point mass approximation by less than a few percent . it can be seen from the figure that with the deformation factor 1.06 the minimum period increases from around 65 min to around 69 min , consistent with renvoiz et al ( 2002 ) for geometrical effects alone . a deformation factor of around 1.18 was required to raise the minimum period to the observed value of min . this is somewhat larger than the intuitive expectation  ^=^=1.12 from kepler s law and roche geometry . in our calculations we consider the simple case in which only the geometrical deformation effects are taken into account . the inclusion of the thermal effects considered by renvoiz et al ( 2002 ) have the likely effect of reducing , possibly by around 2% compared to the case with purely geometrical effects one possible physical mechanism that could cause a deformation factor above the value of 1.06 is magnetic pressure inside the star , as suggested by dantona ( 2000 ) . we note that patterson ( 2000 ) claims to find observational evidence for `` bloated '' secondaries in short period cvs . on the basis of donor mass estimates from the observed superhump excess period he finds that the donors have larger radii than predicted from 1 dimensional . , non deformed stellar models if gravitational radiation is the only am sink . even if true , this observation can not distinguish between an intrinsic deformation of the donor star or the non - equilibrium caused by orbital am losses in excess of the gr rate . to test the statistical significance of the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the period minimum ( `` period spike '' ) we calculated the period distributions of model populations for various assumptions about evolutionary parameters . for each parameter a series of evolutionary tracks were generated , typically around 20 . as systems evolve after the minimum period a point is reached ( typically when falls below ) where numerical fluctuations in become so large that the henyey scheme no longer converges . the stellar code uses tables to interpolate / extrapolate the opacities and equation of state for each iteration , and in this region the extrapolations become very uncertain . to extend the tracks we used a semi - analytical method as follows . the tracks were terminated at a value of , where is the mass transfer rate at the minimum period for the track . the radius of the star for the final part of the track is approximated by r 2=r 0m 2^ , where and are assumed to be constant . the values of and were determined from the final few data points for each track . ( takes a typical value of around 0.15 for systems beyond the period bounce . ) to generate the extension to the track we then calculated from the roche lobe condition , and by assuming stationarity as in section ( see figure , middle frame for an example of an extended track ) . we weight the chances of observation to the brighter systems by assuming , 1.0 . for the detection probability . we tested the calculated model parent distributions for various values of the free parameter against the observed cv period distribution . a k - s ( kolmogorov - smirnov ) test is insensitive to the differences between the parent distributions . the greatest difference in the cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) of the observed and modelled distributions occur at the boundaries of the cdfs , i.e. in the least sensitive region for the k - s test ( press et al 1992 ) . we thus decided to use the following modified test . for each parent distribution 10000 model samples each containing 134 systems were generated . ; ritter & kolb 1998 , internal update june 2001 , as of july 2002 the number of systems in this period range is now 152 though this does alter the values given by the test , the trends and hence the results remain unaltered ] each sample was tested against the model parent distribution using a test , with 1 , 2 and 4 minute bins . this range bridges the need for good resolution and significance of the test which requires a minimum number of cvs per bin . the observed period distribution was tested against the model parent distribution also , giving the reduced value . the fraction of generated samples with a reduced value less than was used as a measure of the significance level of rejecting the hypothesis that the observed distribution is drawn from the parent distribution . in the following we quote the rejection probability pr= . kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) noted that the observed distribution of non - magnetic cvs ( figure , middle frame ) , and the observed distribution of magnetic cvs ( figure , lower frame ) show no significant difference below the period gap . to test and quantify this we compared these distributions for min , giving a reduced probability of 0.1213 . hence we can not rule out that the distributions are drawn from the same underlying parent distribution . this is borne out by the results of comparing both distributions with a parent distribution that is flat in ( see also table , entries f and g ) which give similar rejection probabilities ( pr=0.709 and pr=0.781 , respectively ) . we thus find no significant difference between the two distributions . in the following we therefore test models against the combined magnetic and non - magnetic distribution of observed systems . the lack of any distinct features in the combined observed period distribution ( figure , upper frame ) does indeed suggest an essentially flat distribution for the underlying parent distribution . the flat distribution gives pr = 0.552 ( for the 1 minute bin width , see table ) . we use this value as a benchmark for the models discussed below . king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) constructed a ( nearly ) flat period distribution by superimposing individual idealized pdfs with different bounce periods according to a suitably tailored weighting . for the double box - shaped idealised pdfs modelled on the pdf shown in our figure ( lower frame ) the required weighting is ] , but this still gives the fairly large value ( see also figure ) . however , such a parent population is inconsistent with the observed distribution for longer periods . as can be seen from figure systems that are subject to larger deformation factors would evolve into the period gap , hence the gap would be populated in this model . for completeness we show in figure the result of the superposition suggested by king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) if realistic rather than idealised pdfs are used . this model assumes additional systemic am losses ( ; no caml , no deformation factor , ) as the control parameter for varying , and the weighting as in king et al . the pronounced feature just above 2 hrs orbital period is the result of the adiabatic reaction of the donor stars at turn - on of mass transfer ( see e.g. ritter & kolb 1992 ) . such a feature is absent in the observed distribution . if deformation effects are taken into account the additional am losses required to wash out the spike would cover a similar range but at a smaller magnitude . the resulting period distribution would be similar to the one shown in figure we have investigated mechanisms that could increase the bounce period for cvs from the canonical theoretical value min to the observed value min , and ways to wash out the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the minimum period ( the period spike ) . unlike king , schenker & hameury 2002 we focussed on effects other than increased systemic angular momentum ( am ) losses , i.e. we assume that gravitational radiation is the only systemic sink of orbital am . we find that even a maximal efficient consequential am loss ( caml ) mechanism can not increase the bounce period sufficiently . as the real cv population is likely to comprise systems with a range of caml efficiencies we would in any case expect to have a distribution of systems down to min , rather than the observed sharp cut - off . we considered donor stars that are `` bloated '' due to intrinsic effects , such as the tidal deformation found in 3-dim . sph simulations of roche - lobe filling stars . an implausibly large deformation factor of around 1.18 is needed to obtain a bounce period of min . a possible alternative identification of as an age limit rather than a period bounce ( king & schenker 2002 ) would limit the donor mass in any cv in a cv population dominated by hydrogen rich , unevolved systems to . any system with donor mass much less than this would either have an orbital period less than 78 minutes or would have already evolved beyond the period minimum . there are indeed systems with suspected ; good candidates are wz sge ( ; patterson et al 1998 ) and oy car ( ; pratt et al . 1999 ) . it is also possible that systems die or fade before reaching the period bounce , and hence become undetectable as cvs . the fact that the very different groups of non - magnetic and magnetic cvs show almost identical values of ( see figure ) strongly suggests that the physical cause for the potential fading would have to be rooted in the donor stars or the evolution rather than the accretion physics or emission properties of the systems . even if the bounce period problem is ignored we find in all synthesized model populations ( except for the age limit model ) a pronounced remaining feature due to the accumulation of systems near the bounce . we employ a modified test to measure the `` goodness '' of fit against the observed sample . an f - test ( press et al 1992 ) was also applied to the majority of models and the same general trends observed . none of our synthesised model populations fits as well as the distribution which is simply flat in orbital period ( rejection probability ) . only models where brighter systems carry a far greater weight than expected in a simple magnitude limited sample ( selection factor with rather than ) achieve similar values for . however , most of our models with canot be rejected unambiguously on the basis of this test . models designed to `` wash out '' the period spike by introducing a large spread of the caml efficiency do generally better than population models based on donor stars that are subject to a large spread of intrinsic deformation factors . for all models the rejection probability decreases if the full wd mass spectrum is taken into account , as this introduces an additional spread in the bounce period . model populations where all cvs form at long orbital periods ( chiefly above the period gap ) give a much better fit than models that include newborn cvs with small donor mass . adding these systems to the population introduces a general increase of the orbital period distribution towards short periods , thus making the period spike more pronounced . this suggests that most cvs must have formed at long periods and evolved through the period gap to become short - period cvs . this is consistent with independent evidence that cv secondary stars are somewhat evolved ( baraffe & kolb 2000 ; schenker et al . 2002 ; thorstensen et al 2002 ) . recently , king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) constructed a flat orbital period distribution by superimposing idealised pdfs that describe subpopulations of cvs with a fixed initial donor mass and initial wd mass , but different bounce periods . this superposition required a strongly declining number of systems with increasing bounce periods . we repeated this experiment with a realistic pdf , but failed to obtain a markedly improved fit . in conclusion , we find that the period minimum problem and the period spike problem remain an open issue . it is possible to construct cv model populations where the period spike is washed out sufficiently so that it can not be ruled out unambiguously on the basis of an objective statisticial test against the observed cv period distribution . we thank graham wynn , andrew king and isabelle baraffe for useful discussions . andrew conway and chris jones who gave advice on the statistical analysis . we also thank andrew norton for a critical reading of the paper and the referee jean - marie hameury for useful comments .", "summary": "we investigate if consequential angular momentum losses ( caml ) or an intrinsic deformation of the donor star in cvs could increase the cv bounce period from the canonical theoretical value min to the observed value min , and if a variation of these effects in a cv population could wash out the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the minimum period ( the period spike ) . we are able to construct suitably mixed cv model populations that a statisticial test can not rule out as the parent population of the observed cv sample . however , the goodness of fit is never convincing , and always slightly worse than for a simple , flat period distribution . generally , the goodness of fit is much improved if all cvs are assumed to form at long orbital periods . the weighting suggested by king , schenker & hameury ( 2002 ) does not constitute an improvment if a realistically shaped input period distribution is used . binaries : close stars : evolution stars : mass - loss novae , cataclysmic variables ."}

? * theorem 8.15 ) , if is any partition then ( this is the modular version of above . ) since the functor sending an -module to is clearly exact , this is all we need to prove the lemma. let be a field and let . if is a partition of then has a specht filtration , with the specht factors given by young s rule . similarly has a specht filtration , with the specht factors given by pieri s rule . the first statement follows from james modular version of young s rule ( * ? ? ? * corollary 17.14 ) . the second may be deduced from the first by using . since the functor sending an -module to is exact , it follows from theorem that if is an -module with a specht filtration then also has a specht filtration , with the specht factors given by repeated applications of young s rule . naturally there is a similar result for . it remains to state two results concerning summands of permutation modules . both of these have a slightly technical flavour , but neither is at all difficult to apply . let be a field of prime characteristic . if is a subgroup of such that the permutation character is multiplicity - free then all the summands of are self - dual . for simplicity , we assume that is the field with elements . let be an indecomposable direct summand of . let denote the ring of -adic integers . since is a direct summand of a permutation module , we may lift to a -module such that is a direct summand of and . ( see for an outline of this lifting process . ) suppose that is not self - dual . then the lifted module is not self - dual either . since is self - dual , we may find a summand of such that . as and are non - isomorphic , they are distinct summands of . but and have the same ordinary character . this contradicts our assumption that the character is multiplicity - free. this lemma deals with the assertions about duality in theorem . it may also be used to replace the reference to the author s d. phil thesis ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.5.1 ) in the proof of theorem 4 of . finally , we shall often be in the position of knowing that a permutation module has a specht filtration , and wishing to prove that the same result holds for each of its summands . since in theorem we assume that our ground field is algebraically closed and of characteristic , we may use the homological algebra approach developed by hemmer and nakano in . ( for an alternative , slightly less technological approach , see the remark attributed to s. donkin at the end of 1 of . ) we are now ready to prove theorem . by the work of hemmer and nakano , when , the multiplicities of the factors in a specht filtration are well - defined . hence it suffices to show that each of the permutation modules in theorem has a specht filtration , with the specht factors given by its ordinary character . we start with the modules coming from case ( a ) of theorem . suppose that . since the ground field has odd characteristic , it follows from lemma and theorem that each of the four summands has a specht filtrations . proposition now guarantees that any indecomposable summand of has a specht filtration . this deals with all the subgroups appearing in case ( a ) , and also the subgroups of in case ( b2 ) . now suppose that . we first note that where is the -dimensional representation of defined in 2.2 . hence both of the summands have a specht filtration . ( here it is essential that has odd characteristic : see 4.2 for an example when has characteristic . ) it follows that and both have specht filtrations . moreover , if is a subgroup of of index then is in every case a direct summand of , and so has a specht filtration . hence if is any subgroup of such that , then has a specht filtration . by theorem , also has a specht filtration . these remarks deal with all the remaining subgroups in case ( b ) . in cases ( c ) and ( d ) , a considerable amount of work is done for us by theorem 2 of , which implies that has a specht filtration . by theorem , also has a specht filtration . the argument giving in 2.4 shows that we may now apply lemma and proposition to deduce that the summands of the left - hand side have specht filtrations . it only remains to deal with the permutation modules from case ( e ) . by our usual arguments , together with the remark following theorem , it suffices to show that for , or , has a specht filtration . this is immediate if , as then every -module is a direct sum of specht modules . the other cases turn out to be surprisingly easy . if and or then the specht modules corresponding to the non - trivial ordinary characters in are simple and projective . hence when and we observe that since does not contain any elements of order , is projective . it is well known ( see ) that any projective module for a symmetric group has a specht filtration . the only case left is when and . one sees from that each irreducible ordinary character appearing in lies in a different -block of , and that the only non - projective constituents are the trivial and sign representations . hence this completes the proof of theorem . ] let be an algebraically closed field of characteristic . we shall show that the module is a counterexample to the conjecture that every permutation module has a specht filtration . it would be interesting to collect further examples of permutation modules over fields of odd characteristic which do not have specht filtrations at the moment , it is far from clear how common they are . the shortest demonstration that the author has been able to discover hinges on the simple module . ( see ( * ? ? ? * definition 11.2 ) for the definition of the . ) one can show , either with the help of computer algebra , or more lengthily by ad hoc arguments ( see below ) , that contains a submodule isomorphic to . it follows from the table of decomposition numbers of in characteristic ( see ( * ? ? ? * p145 ) ) that there are only four specht modules which ( a ) have as a composition factor , and ( b ) do not also have other composition factors that are absent in . they are by a standard result ( see ( * ? ? ? * corollary 12.2 ) ) , only appears at the top of . by , appears in the socle of if and only if appears in the top of ; this is also ruled out by ( * ? ? ? * corollary 12.2 ) . the same argument works for . finally , one can use the long exact sequence given by the maps constructed by hamernik in ( * ? ? ? * p449 ) to show that contains in its top , but not in its socle . ( hamernik works only with symmetric groups of prime degree , but it is easy to generalise this part of his work to deal with hook - specht modules for whenever the characteristic of divides : see . ) thus none of the candidate specht modules contains as a submodule . the result follows . it remains to show that appears in the socle of . for this we shall need the following lemma , which is of some independent interest . let be an algebraically closed field , let be a finite group and let be an indecomposable -module such that , appears exactly twice as a composition factor of . then is -dimensional . let . by a corollary of fitting s lemma ( see ( * ? ? ? * lemma 1.4.5 ) ) , is either nilpotent or invertible . if is nilpotent then is isomorphic to a proper submodule of ; by ( b ) this can only happen if and is , up to a scalar , the map defined by if is invertible , then it has a non - zero eigenvalue . since is not invertible , it must be a scalar multiple of . hence . let be an algebraically closed field of characteristic . the simple module lies in the socle of . proof . by basic clifford theory , it is equivalent to show that lies in the socle of ; for an introduction to the clifford theory needed to relate representations of the alternating and symmetric groups , see ( * ? ? * chapter 5 ) . it follows from in 2.3 that where is one of the two irreducible constituents of . ( the labelling of this pair of characters is essentially arbitrary , and we do not need to be any more precise here . ) from this , one can use decomposition numbers of to show that the composition factors of are let be a sylow -subgroup of and let be a sylow -subgroup of containing . note that . it follows from mackey s lemma that where runs over a set of representatives for the double cosets of and in . if is any subgroup of then , by frobenius reciprocity hence each summand of the right - hand side of is indecomposable with a -dimensional socle . the dimension of is which is divisible by . it follows that if is any indecomposable summand of ( considered as a -module ) then has dimension divisible by . since the ordinary character is multiplicity - free with three irreducible constituents , the -permutation module has a -dimensional endomorphism algebra . by ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.11.3 ) , the endomorphism algebra is also -dimensional . the -dimensional simple module and the -dimensional simple module can not appear as summands of . since they each appear but once as compositions factors of , they must lie in its middle loewy layer . if , in addition , does not appear in the socle of , then must be indecomposable , with top and socle both isomorphic to the trivial module . but then lemma implies that is -dimensional , a contradiction . hence contains . remark : a small extension of this argument shows that is indecomposable , with the loewy layers shown below . ] we now consider . it is easy to show that this module has the loewy layers by in 2.2 , the ordinary character associated to is . it is known that although the trivial module is a composition factor of , it does not appear in either the top or socle of ( see ( * ? ? ? * example 24.5(iii ) ) ) . it follows that there is no specht filtration of with the factors and . one can , however , exploit the outer automorphism of , which sends the specht module to and leaves fixed , to show that there is a short exact sequence thus has a specht filtration , but the specht factors required are not those indicated by the associated ordinary character . it is left to the reader to formulate any of the many conjectures to which this module is a counterexample . i should like to thank michael collins for asking me the question that lead to the work of 2 , and an anonymous referee for his or her very helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper . , on multiplicity - free permutation representations , in : finite geometries and designs ( proc . conf . , chelwood gate , 1980 ) , vol . 49 of london math . lecture note ser . , cambridge university press , 1981 , pp .", "summary": "building on work of saxl , we classify the multiplicity - free permutation characters of all symmetric groups of degree or more . a corollary is a complete list of the irreducible characters of symmetric groups ( again of degree or more ) which may appear in a multiplicity - free permutation representation . the multiplicity - free characters in a related family of monomial characters are also classified . we end by investigating a consequence of these results for specht filtrations of permutation modules defined over fields of prime characteristic . keywords : multiplicity - free , symmetric group , permutation character , monomial character , specht filtration email address : ` wildon@maths.ox.ac.uk ` affiliation : mathematics department , swansea university , singleton park , swansea , sa2 8pp address for correspondence : department of mathematics , university of bristol , university walk , bristol , bs8 1tw . tel : 07747 636959 in this paper we prove three theorems on the multiplicity - free representations of symmetric groups . these theorems have interesting consequences for the permutation actions of symmetric groups , and for the theory of specht filtrations of permutation modules , while also being of interest in their own right . our notation is standard . let denote the symmetric group of degree , and let denote the ordinary irreducible character of canonically labelled by the partition of .

{"article": "having been discovered more than a century ago , whistler waves become one of the most important waves in plasmas . such waves ( also known as helicons in solid state plasmas ) are low - frequency ( lf ) ( in comparison with the electron - cyclotron frequency , ) right - hand circularly polarized ( rcp ) electromagnetic ( em ) waves guided almost along the external magnetic field in dense plasmas . because of the increase of their group velocity with the frequency , ( see , e.g. ref . ) , the lf waves arrive later giving rise a whistling down - effect observed at ground level . stenzel in his classic paper stenzel demonstrated experimentally the creation of magnetic field - aligned density perturbations excited by the ponderomotive force exerted by the em whistlers . whistler waves are important not only in space plasmas due to wave - particle interactions , but also in laboratory plasmas as helicons for efficient plasma production as well as in dense astrophysical environments whistlertheory1,whistlertheory2,mi , whistlertheory3(nearsonic),whistlertheory4,whistlertheory5,whistlerparametricinstability . on the other hand , large amplitude whistlers propagating in a magnetized plasma can initiate a great variety of nonlinear effects , e.g. , three - wave interactions , parametric instabilities , modulational instability and the subsequent soliton formation whistlertheory1,whistlertheory2,mi . the latter which , in turn , causes local electron density enhancement or depletion in plasmas , are considered as a basis for understanding laser energy deposition in pellets , pulsar radiation interaction with the ambient magnetosphere ambientmagnetosphere , whistler wave propagation in solar winds solarwind etc . recent laboratory experiment and observations from the freja satellite show the clear evidence for the formation of whistler envelope solitons accompanied by plasma density cavities . moreover , electrons in van allen radiation belts can be accelerated to mev energies within a short period by large amplitude whistlers . the latter have recently been observed by the cluster spacecraft , the stereos cattell and the themis . furthermore , laboratory experiments and theoretical confirmation have demonstrated the existence of propagating whistler spheromaks with fields exceeding the ambient magnetic field . whistlers also contribute to fast magnetic reconnection and plasma dynamics in two - beam laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments . recently , there has been a notably growing interest in investigating various quantum plasma effects in view of some experimental progresses in nanoscale plasmas , ultracold plasmas , spintronics and plasmonics . on the other hand , superdense quantum plasmas are omnipresent in compact astrophysical objects , e.g. , the interior of massive white dwarfs , interior of jupitors , magnetars etc . , as well as in the next generation intense laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments . in dense plasmas , degenerate electrons follow fermi - dirac pressure law , and there are typically quantum force associated with the bohm de broglie potential , which produce wave dispersion at nanoscales quantum1,quantum2,quantum3 . furthermore , the effects of the electron spin manifests itself in terms of a magnetic dipole force , as well spin precession , which can be exploited by transforming the pauli equation to fluid - like variables . more elaborate kinetic models has also been developed . hence the dynamics of electrons in fermi degenerate plasmas will be affected not only by the lorentz force , but also by the effects of quantum statistical pressure , the bohm force as well as the effects due to intrinsic spin of electrons . we ought to mention that in a dense magnetized plasma there also exist spin waves , which can be excited by intense neutrino fluxes . thus , nonlinear theories of em waves , in particular whistlers in magnetized dense plasmas need to be developed in its own right accounting for all these quantum effects . recently , the theory of the ponderomotive force in plasmas has been extended to account for the contribution from the intrinsic spin of electrons . it has been demonstrated that an em pulse can induce a spin - polarized plasma by this spin - ponderomotive force ( spf ) . such force could also play an important role in the propagation of lf em waves , e.g. , whistlers , alfvn waves . our objective here is to present a theoretical study of modulated whistler wave packets interacting nonlinearly with background lf density perturbations that are reinforced by the classical ponderomotive force ( cpf ) as well as the spf . the role of the ion motion as well as the dispersive effects due to charge separation and the electron tunneling are also taken into account . we will include the field aligned velocity perturbation ( free electron streaming ) associated with the lf motion , and in addition , generalize the related classical results that exist in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs . whistlertheory1,whistlertheory2 ) . the obtained results could be useful for understanding the propagation of localized em whistlers which may emanate in the interior of magnetized white dwarfs , magnetars as well as in the next generation intense laser - solid density plasma experiments . let us consider the propagation of nonlinearly coupled em whistlers and ion - acoustic ( ia ) density perturbations along a constant magnetic field in a quantum electron - ion plasma where any equilibrium drift velocity is zero . in the modulational representation , the high - frequency ( hf ) em wave field for the rcp whistlers is given by c.c . , where is the slowly varying ( both in space and time ) envelope of the whistler wave electric field and c.c . stands for the complex conjugate . also , represents the whistler wave frequency ( number ) . the basic equations for the evolution of nonlinear whistlers then read spin1,spinponderomotive , spinevolutioneqn . where denote the number density , mass and velocity of electrons respectively , is the magnetic field and is the electron thermal pressure . also , is the spin angular momentum with its absolute value where is the electron -factor and is the bohr magneton . the equations - are then closed by the following maxwell equations with .the equations - represent the nonrelativistic evolution of spin electrons , and are applicable even when different states with spin - up and spin - down ( relative to the magnetic field ) can be well represented by a macroscopic average . this may , however , occur in the regimes of very strong magnetic fields ( or a very low temperature regimes ) , where generally the electrons occupy the lowest energy spin states . on the other hand , for a time - scale longer than the spin - flip frequency , the macroscopic spin state is well - described by the thermodynamic equilibrium spin configuration , and in this case the above model can still be applied . however , such case in which the macroscopic spin state will be attenuated by a factor decreasing the effective value of below , will not be considered further in the present work . as a consequence , our studies will be focused on the regime of strong magnetic fields and high density plasmas . taking the curl of eq .  and using eqs . -

phase speed ( compared to the electron thermal speed ) . thus , the lf electrostatic modulation also satisfies the electron momentum equation where is the lf part of the wave electric field and is the fermi speed relevant for a high density plasma . here and is the boltzmann constant . the term is the quantum correction associated with the bohm de broglie potential . the ponderomotive force contributions are proportional to the constants and where in which the first terms appear due to cpf and the second ones are due to the spf spinponderomotive . the equations for the cold ion motion involved in the lf ia perturbations are eliminating and disregarding the term we obtain from eqs .  , -

contain the main results of the present work . in particular , previous results can be recovered by disregarding the spin contribution as well as the particle dispersion and considering , e.g. , the isothermal equation of state ( relevant for low or moderate density plasmas ) . in this section we will investigate the properties of nonlinear whistlers by solving numerically the eqs . - in the stationary frame ( where . we will consider the parameter regimes for the density and the magnetic field for which the nonrelativistic fluid model is valid and spf is comparable to the cpf . we will also see that the case in which spf dominates over the cpf may correspond to the strongly magnetized superdense plasmas where relativistic treatement may be necessary . however , before going further to such discussions let us first consider the particular case in which the dispersion due to charge separtion ( quasineutrality ) is negligibe . the latter can be justified even when the spin effects dominate , i.e. , . from the scalingwe find that the quasineutrality limit holds in nonrelativistic  plasmas as long as and . however , we will see that in a specific parameter regime , such restrictions can be valid for very lf  whistler modes . in this case , t and with moreover , when the contribution from the term can be smaller than that since thus , in the quasineutral regime , we obtain from eqs . - the following nls equation.together with then we can write eq .  as , where is defined as where physically , the electrons experience a longitudinal force exerted by the front of the whistler pulse , and thereby gain a net energy . the electrons gain energy during the rising front of the pulse , but then slows down by the backward ponderomotive - like force . moreover , electrons can approach the group velocity of the whistler when it reaches the pulse peak at the center . from eq .  , we find that this can be possible for , which may happen for a whistler frequency satisfying and for high density ( m ) and strongly magnetized ( t ) plasmas . in this case , the fermi speed may exceed the group speed  . on the other hand , corresponding to the parameters as in fig . 1 below , and so that and again , note that slow electrons can freely move along the direction of the external magnetic field . the finite velocity perturbations would then induce an additional density change in order to maintain the conservation of particles ( equation of continuity ) under localized disturbances . consequently , the total density variation in the frequency - shift becomes where ) and  with associated electric field ( upper panel ) and density perturbation ( lower panel ) for ( solid line ) and ( dashed line ) . the other parameter values are m , t , , m / s , width=288,height=288 ] ) and  with associated electric field ( upper panel ) and density perturbation ( lower panel ) for t ( solid line ) and t ( dashed line ) . the other parameter values are m , , the corresponding values are ( solid line ) and ( dashed line ) . , width=288,height=288 ] clearly , changes sign whenever the third term in eq .  dominates over the other two terms . now , for lf propagation of whistlers , and as in the previous section , is smaller compared to when the spin contribution dominates . thus , in the quasineutral lf regime , the density and velocity perturbations are positive and negative according as the whistler wave propagation is subsonic or supersonic ) ] . furthermore , localized bright ( dark ) envelope solutions of eq .  exist through the modulational instability ( stability ) when for lf waves when , and according as hence , a possible final state of the mi could be a supersonic ( subsonic ) bright ( dark ) soliton - like structure in a quasineutral spin quantum plasma . equation  has an exact soliton solution ( when and have the same sign ) of the form , \\]]where are constants . the other particular cases , namely the quasistationary lf density response ( i.e. , for which and the case of unidirectional propagation ( near sonic envelope ) in which the quasineutrality is not a valid assumption will not be discussed here as those cases are not so relevant to the parameter regimes to be considered , instead we will focus on our main eqs . -  . thus , we look for stationary solutions of eqs . -  in the stationary frame . here we assume to be of the form where is a real function and is a real constant . -  reduce to where we numerically solve the equations  and  by newton method with the boundary conditions as . we consider the density and magnetic field strength to vary as m and t . figure 1 illustrates the existence of double - hump localized whistler envelope accompanied with a density depletion for a set of parameters : m t , and the corresponding frequencies are s and s also , m and m/s . thus , the whistlers have negative group dispersion with from the dispersion relation we obtain m which corresponds to whistlers with a wavelength of m , and the group speed is m/s . furthermore , the nonlinear frequency shift is obtained as . the density depletion is observed quite small due to large group velocity ( compared to the sound speed ) of the whistler waves . in another illustration ( fig . 2 ) with a higher magnetic field , we observe a dark - soliton - like structure correlated with a density hump . the amplitude of the solitary pulse decreases as the magnetic field increases . in fig . 3 we have presented the solitary structures when the density is very high ( m ) . this basically corresponds to the case when however , in this case one must note that the fermi speed is close to or can even be larger than the speed of light in vacuum and so , nonrelativistic quantum fluid model may no longer be appropriate . the quantum parameter has no significant role for the regime considered here , as can be seen that mainly dominates in the term ) ] , because of large group velocity  . in order that can be comparable to , one might have to consider relatively higher densities m and weakly magnetized plasmas . however , in this case the coefficient  will be much larger than the other coefficients , which might prevent any hope for localized solution . as shown in fig . 4 , one can excite a nondiverging whistler with a positive group dispersion in other regime , e.g. , m and t for which m/s , , m/s , m/s . this basically corresponds to oscillatory pulse associated with a field - aligned density hump  and  with associated electric field ( upper panel ) and density perturbation ( lower panel ) for ( solid line ) and ( dashed and dotted ine ) . the other parameter values are t , m ( for solid and dashed line ) and m ( for dotted line ) , . the values of are ( for solid and dashed line ) and ( for dotted line ) . , width=288,height=288 ] ) and  with associated electric field ( upper panel ) and density perturbation ( lower panel ) for t , m , . the other parameters are m/s . , width=288,height=288 ] nonlinear interaction of the hf pump em whistlers with lf electrostatic field aligned perturbations gives rise upper and lower side bands with frequency and wave numbers respectively and the latter interacts with the pump and thus produces a lf ponderomotive force which eventually reinforces the lf electrostatic oscillations . when all the perturbations are aligned along the external magnetic field , the parametric interactions of em waves can be described from eqs . -  by the following dispersion relation . \\notag \\\\ & = 4v {g}e {0}^{2}\\left ( 1-\\omega ^{2}\\right ) \\left ( \\lambda { 1}k+\\lambda { 2}\\omega \\right ) \\left ( k\\gamma { 1}+\\zeta \\omega \\right ) , \\ ] ] where and have been normalized by and respectively . some simplification can be in order . note that under the quasineutrality assumption , the coefficient of and the term as well as the term in the coefficient of will not appear . also , for lf propagation of whistlers is smaller and thus being neglected . moreover , the ratio of the term in the coefficient of ( which appears due to the parallel electron streaming ) and the constant term scales as and we need for spin effects to be dominant . thus , in this case the dispersion relation reduces to where in which etc . are being normalized . clearly , mi sets in for modulation wave numbers satisfying or for highly dense medium and small the growth rate of instability is then given by hence , in the long - wavelength limit ( maximum growth rate of instability can be achieved , and is roughly proportional to the pump wave electric field and for parameters as in fig . 1 , we obtain it basically restricts the characteristic length - scale to a certain value for the formation of envelope solitons through mi . in the present investigation focusing on whistler waves we point out that the spin contribution is substantial when i.e. , when and this corresponds to the case in which the magnetic field strength , and the particle density is very high , i.e. , m for which the magnetic field is non - quantizing and does not affect the thermodynamic properties of electrons . however , in such regimes , the fermi velocity may approach or exceed the whistler group velocity ( close to in the present study ) , and so the nonrelativistic quantum fluid model may no longer be appropriate to consider . in the present work , we have considered t and the density to vary in the range m in order that the nonrelativistic fluid model is valid to some extent . moreover that and the terms due to spin magnetization current together with the spf are comparable to the classical counter parts . furthermore , in this regime the velocity of electrons remains much smaller than the whistler group velocity  . since the whistler group speed is much higher than the ia speed , whistler solitons are not significantly affected by the particle dispersion associated with the bohm potential as well as the fermi - dirac pressure , though the length scale of excitation is of the order of the compton wavelength . however , those effects reduce the plasma characteristic wavelength of excitation . such effects can be more significant in some other regimes when and/ or for possible excitation of the ion wakefields at nanoscales . note that since degenerate electrons follow the fermi - dirac pressure law ( where the fermi temperature is density dependent ) , the cold plasma limit can not be recovered from the present study unless one consideres , e.g. , isothermal equation of state to be relevant for low or moderate density plasmas . furthermore , means that one approaches the higher density regimes and is the case when one simply disregards the quantum tunneling effect . the parameter regimes considered here can be achievable in the magnetized white dwarfs ( m ) as well as in the next generation intense laser - solid density plasma experiments ( m ) , in x - ray free electron lasers , and in plasmonic devices . one can , in principle , go beyond the parameter regimes considered here ( since there is no specific theoretical limit for the density ) , however , we have to be careful about those parameter values for the excitation of localized whistlers and for spin - ponderomotive force to have a role . the latter may dominantly accelerate the ions by separating the electric charges and building up a high electric field . however , plasma can sustain such high electric fields , and so it remains an attractive medium for particle acceleration , which is still a most important areas of research works in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . in conclusion , we have presented a new set of nonlinear equations which governs the dynamics of modulated whistlers interacting with the field - aligned electrostatic lf density perturbations due to ia fluctuation , in a magnetized spin quantum plasma . both the classical as well as the spin - induced ponderomotive force has been considered to modify the local plasma density in a self - consistent manner . numerical simulation of the governing equations in the stationary frame ) and  ] reveals the existence of supersonic stationary envelope solitons characterized by a single or double hump whistler wave electric fields thatare trapped in a self - created density cavity . this happens for wave frequency satisfying and when the whistler has negative group dispersion . when the whistler frequency is smaller than and the group dispersion is positive at higher densities , one can excite a nondiverging whistler wave , i.e. , a ducted whistler . the latter corresponds to a field aligned density hump with furthermore , the whistler solitons with density dips and humps can occur depending on the consideration of the frequency regime as well as the magnetic field strength and/ or the particle density . we ought to mention that our present investigation on the nonlinear propagation of em whistlers might play an important role in studies of beat - wave particle accelerators as well as in the problem of radio - frequency electron - cyclotron - resonance heating of plasmas where the driver , instead of being a laser , is a whistler wave . apm is grateful to the kempe foundations , sweden , for support through grant no . mm was supported by the european research council under contract no . 204059-qpqv and the swedish research council under contract no . 2007 -

{"article": "since its discovery , in 1980 , the quantum hall ( qh ) effect has been a very rich source of interesting problems related to topological and correlation effects in condensed matter systems . the qh effect is observed in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) exposed to a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the gas . at appropriate electron densities , the 2deg forms an incompressible liquid . the qh effect manifests itself in the precise and universal quantization of the hall conductance . this behavior originates from an interplay between the landau quantization of the orbital motion of electrons and interaction effects , which leads to the formation of a bulk energy gap . as a consequence an incompressible state is formed in the bulk of the 2deg . at the edge of a 2deg exhibiting the qh effect there exist , however , gapless chiral modes that are the quantum analogue of classical skipping orbits. in the presence of strong coulomb interactions , these modes can be viewed as collective edge plasmon modes . remarkably , it has been predicted that , at fractional fillings of the landau levels , besides the collective modes the edge states of the 2deg also describe quasi - particles with fractional charges and fractional statistics . for instance , in qh liquids with filling factor , where is an odd integer , laughlin quasi - particle excitations have an electric charge , where is the elementary electric charge . such excitations can be scattered between opposite edges at narrow constrictions forming quantum point contacts ( qpc ) , thus contributing to a backscattering current . the fractional charge of laughlin quasi - particles has been confirmed , experimentally , in measurements of the shot noise of weak backscattering currents. the quasi - particle charge in these experiments is inferred from the fano factor of noise , which is the ratio of the noise power to the average backscattering current . although , at present , there is a consensus on the interpretation of the experimental results , this type of measurement does not , in general , represent a direct test of the fractional charge of quasi - particles . indeed , the fano factor of noise is not universal and may be reduced or enhanced for various reasons. for instance , the so called `` charge fractionalization '' in nonchiral one - dimensional systems is a property of collective modes that has nothing to do with the existence of fractionally charged quasi - particles . nevertheless , this phenomenon reduces the fano factor of noise at relatively high frequencies. a direct measurement of the quasi - particle charge should rely on its definition as a coupling constant in the interaction hamiltonian coupling matter to the electromagnetic field and on the quantum nature of quasi - particles . the most appealing approach is to make use of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect, which relies on the fact that the interference of quasi - particles is affected by a magnetic flux . following a commonly used formulation of this effect , we consider a gedanken interference experiment shown in the upper panel of fig . . quasi - particles of charge traverse two beam splitters and follow paths that enclose a singular magnetic flux . the relative phase between the two amplitudes , for the upper and lower path , is shifted by an amount of , which leads to ab oscillations in the current from the source to the drain as a function of the flux with quasi - particle period . the quasi - particles can then be detected by differentiating their contribution to the ab effect from electron oscillations with period . ab oscillations with quasi - particle periods larger than the flux quantum have been observed in a number of recent experiments involving qh interferometers of the fabry - prot type . in these interferometers , chiral edge states of a qh system form a loop . the magnetic flux through the loop is varied either by changing the strength of the homogeneous magnetic field , or by deforming the edge of the qh system with the help of a modulation gate . the theoretical interpretation of the experimental results as demonstrating a quasi - particle ab effect appears obvious . nevertheless , it remains the subject of a theoretical debate for the following reasons . first of all , oscillations of the current through a fabry - prot interferometer as a function of the magnetic flux could originate from the coulomb blockade rather than from interference effects . second , the original gedanken formulation of the ab effect outlined above requires a singular magnetic flux threading through the region of the plane not accessible to quasi - particles . this is not the case in the experiments , see ref . , where quasi - particles are directly affected by the magnetic field . third , and more importantly , the gedanken formulation of the ab effect itself leads to a paradox : in any electronic system , including fractional qh systems , ab oscillations should have an electronic period , according to the byers - yang theorem. this is so , because , after adiabatic insertion of a flux quantum through a hole in the sample , an electronic system relaxes to its initial state , since the flux quantum can be removed by a single - valued gauge transformation . the first two problems can in principle be solved by using a qh interferometer of a different type , namely the electronic analog of an optical mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer. very recently , ab oscillations in these interferometers utilizing qh liquids at integer filling factors have become the subject of intensive experimental studies and theoretical discussions. a typical electronic mz interferometer is sketched , schematically , in the lower panel of fig . . in this interferometer the 2deg is confined to a region with a shape topologically equivalent to an annulus , i.e. , a so called corbino disk . chiral edge states are used in place of optical beams and two qpcs ( shown by dashed lines ) play the role of optical beam splitters . ohmic contacts are attached to the inner and outer edge of the corbino disk and serve as a source and drain for the current . although mz interferometers are more difficult to manufacture , they have an advantage over fabry - prot interferometers : first , modes in two edge channels of the interferometer propagate in the same direction and without backscattering , because they are interrupted by ohmic contacts . as a result , the coulomb blockade can be avoided in these systems by strongly coupling the edge states to ohmic contacts . second , a singular magnetic flux can , at least in principle , be inserted in the hole of the corbino disk , i.e. , in the region not accessible to electrons . therefore , electronic mz interferometers might be thought to be a solid - state implementations of the gedanken experiment shown in the upper panel of fig . . they may thus represent an ideal system for addressing the third problem mentioned above , namely the paradox associated with the byers - yang theorem . there have been several theoretical attempts to resolve this paradox . in early work , thouless and gefen have considered the energy spectrum of a qh liquid confined to a corbino disk and weakly coupled to ohmic contacts . they have found that as a result of weak quasi - particle tunneling between the inner and the outer edge of the corbino disk , the energy spectrum , and consequently , `` any truly thermodynamic quantity '' is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with the electronic period . although thouless and gefen have made an important first step towards understanding the ab effect in qh interferometers , their analysis is rather qualitative , and some of their statements concerning the tunneling rates and currents are not firmly justified. the results of their work are difficult to interpret at the level of effective theories . but , more importantly , they can not easily be generalized to the situation where the magnetic flux is varied with the help of a gate voltage . this situation has stimulated further interest in the fractional ab effect in mz interferometers . more recently , a number of authors ( see refs . ) have proposed that the correct description of the mz interferometers should take into account the presence of additional quantum numbers in a qh state . in the thermodynamic limit , averaging the quasi - particle current over these quantum numbers is claimed to restore the electronic ab periodicity . these quantum numbers are usually introduced ad hoc , with minimal justification . depending on the particular theoretical discussion , they are represented either in terms of so called klein factors in the tunneling operators, or as additional phase shifts induced by quasi - particles localized at the inner edge of the corbino disk . we are aware of only one attempt to theoretically justify the introduction of klein factors in mz interferometers : in their recent work , ponomarenko and averin implement a resummation of electron tunneling processes between the inner and outer edge and claim that there is a duality to weak quasi - particle tunneling , where the klein factors arise naturally . however , their analysis is done entirely at the level of an effective theory , where weak quasi - particle and weak electron tunneling are the two fixed points of a renormalization group flow . there is no guarantee that microscopic considerations will yield the same result . the results of the works can be summarized as follows : they resolve the byers - yang paradox by stating that ab oscillations with quasi - particle periods can not be observed in the steady - state current through an mz interferometer . in other words , these works do not discriminate between the effects of a singular flux , modulation gate , and a homogeneous magnetic field . our findings do not agree with this conclusion . in previous work, we have argued that quasi - particle ab oscillations should be observable if the magnetic flux is varied by deforming the edge of the qh system , or , alternatively , by changing the strength of the homogeneous magnetic field . we have proposed to use this effect as a spectroscopic tool for experimental investigations of scaling dimensions of quasi - particles at different filling factors . in the present paper we construct the theoretical basis for this effect . our predictions can be verified experimentally by pinching off the qpcs and comparing the regimes of weak electron tunneling and of weak quasi - particle tunneling , where the periods of ab oscillations should differ from each other by a factor of . our theoretical arguments are presented on three different levels : by considering a microscopic wave function for the ground state of an mz interferometer , deriving an effective theory from it , and describing the relaxation of the interferometer to a stationary state with a master equation . at the level of the microscopic theory we arrive at the rather surprising conclusion that the ab effect , in its original formulation, is not exhibited by qh interferometers . in order to clarify this important claim , we first remark that the original formulation of the effect relies on a single - particle picture , where a particle wave travels through the interferometer , as shown in the upper panel of fig . . while traveling through the upper and lower paths of the interferometer , the particle wave accumulates a phase difference containing three contributions : a dynamical and a kinematic one , and the ab phase differences . this picture is quite appealing and is therefore commonly used in the physics literature . however , for the description of the ab effect , this picture is redundant , because at low energies , the dynamical phase can be neglected . instead , it is more appropriate to consider the relative phase of the wave function overlaps at the two beam splitters . moreover , in correlated systems , such as qh interferometers , the single - particle description is , strictly speaking , not applicable . in particular , the naive ( gedanken ) formulation of the ab effect may lead to serious misconceptions and problems , one of them being the byers - yang paradox ; ( see also the discussion in sec . ) . thus , we propose to investigate many - particle wave function overlaps . to this end , we consider a microscopic model of an mz interferometer schematically shown in fig . a qh liquid at filing factor is confined to a region between two circles of radii and . by separating the centers of the two circles , we deliberately break the axial symmetry in order to avoid specific geometry effects and to exhibit the general character of our results . the inner and outer edges of the qh liquid are connected to ohmic contacts at points and via strong electronic tunneling . weak backscattering at two qpcs is modeled by quasi - particle tunneling between points , , and , , as indicated in fig . by dashed lines . the state of the qh liquid is described by a laughlin - type wave function , see eqs .  and  . we generalize the laughlin wave function , in order to take into account the deformation of the qh edge caused by the modulation gate , eq .  . exactly the same procedure can be applied in order to describe a qh liquid of arbitrary shape . this will allow us to choose and in order to describe realistic qpcs . finally , the effect of a singular flux threading through the hole in the interferometer is described by the wave function in eq .  . it turns out that the wave function overlap  at a point , i.e. , the matrix element of a quasi - particle tunneling operator  , is a single - valued function of , for any number , , of quasi - particles in the interferometer . this implies that the commonly used picture, according to which every quasi - particle carries a `` statistical phase tube '' seen by other quasi - particles as an additional phase shift , does not apply naively to mz interferometers . more importantly , in the presence of a singular magnetic flux , the laughlin wave function  contains a flux - dependent factor , which depends only on the distance between electrons and the flux tube . in other words , the ab phase from the gauge field is canceled , locally , by the phase induced by the physical deformation of the laughlin wave function in response to the singular flux . this fact is independent of the shape of the qh system and leads to an exact cancellation of the relative ab phase in the tunneling amplitudes  . thus , we arrive at the rather remarkable result that the ab effect , in its original formulation, does not exist in qh interferometers . however , in response to local edge deformations induced by a modulation gate , as described by eq .  , the wave function and , consequently , the tunneling amplitudes acquire a relative phase proportional to the total change in the homogeneous magnetic flux through the qh liquid enclosed by the interferometer . this effect leads to oscillations in the current with quasi - particle period . note that this phenomenon , which we propose to call a quasi - particle ab effect , does not violate the byers - yang theorem . in order to connect these findings to the low - energy effective theory of the qh effect, we consider small incompressible deformations of the ground state of an mz interferometer , as shown in fig . , below . the microscopic wave function resulting from such deformations , given by eqs .  and  , is parameterized by an infinite set of variables , . we invoke the classical plasma analogy and follow the steps of ref . in order to project the microscopic hamiltonian onto the subspace of these deformations . after the projection , the variables turn into oscillator operators , , with canonical commutation relations  . these operators describe gapless plasmon excitations at the edge of the qh liquid . the projected hamiltonian  contains the oscillator part with a linear spectrum and the coulomb charging energy , which depends on the number of quasi - particles , , and the number of electrons , , in the qh system . the projected tunneling operators take the form of vertex operators  . interestingly , we do not find any trace of klein factors in the tunneling amplitudes . moreover , contrary to earlier suggestions, the tunneling hamiltonians at different points in space do not commute with each other ( see appendix ) . we show that the low - energy theory so derived agrees well with the effective theory of wen and one of us, generalized so as to take into account the finite size of the qh system and the effects of a modulation gate and of a singular magnetic flux . at the level of the effective theory , the three contributions to the overall phase shift in the current oscillations , the dynamical , kinematic , and ab phase mentioned above , acquire the following interpretation. the dynamical phase has its origin in temporal fluctuations of the charge density at the edge described with the help of the oscillator operators , . these fluctuations suppress the ab effect at high temperatures but can be neglected at low energies . the kinematic phase can be viewed as a contribution of zero modes . in order to interpret the ab phase , we note that the effective theory in refs . and arises as a boundary contribution to a topological chern - simons theory describing the bulk of the 2deg in the presence of an external electromagnetic field . within this theory , the ab phase is picked up by a wilson loop ) ] along the interferometer contour . there are two contributions to this phase : one is proportional to the gauge field describing the singular magnetic flux ; the other one comes from the charge accumulated at the inner edge as a result of an adiabatic variation of the singular flux . it turns out that these two contributions cancel each other exactly , so that the total phase due to a singular magnetic flux vanishes . in the particular gauge we use , the cancellation is local in space and can be viewed as screening of the singular flux by the qh liquid . we propose to call this effect topological screening , in order to emphasize its independence of the particular sample geometry . having constructed the low - energy theory of an isolated qh system , we proceed to analyze the quasi - particle transport at qpcs and the electron transport at ohmic contacts . we apply the tunneling approximation to describe both processes as rare transitions that change the numbers , and , of electrons at the inner and outer edge of the corbino disk and the number , , of quasi - particles at the inner edge , where . the dynamics of the mz interferometer on a long time scale is described by a master equation for the probability to find the system in a state corresponding to given values of . in order to model ohmic contacts , we consider the limit of strong electron tunneling . as a result , the density matrix in the electronic sector approaches the product of two equilibrium distributions determined by the ohmic reservoirs  . then we sum over the electronic numbers and and obtain the master equation , see  and  , for the density matrix in the quasi - particle sector indexed by . finally , solving this master equation , we find the current through the mz interferometer as a function of the magnetic flux , thereby establishing the main results of our paper . namely , we find that the current oscillates as a function of the singular magnetic flux with the electronic period , and these oscillations are exponentially suppressed with temperature and system size . this implies that they can be viewed as a coulomb blockade effect . in contrast , as a function of the magnetic flux modulation due to a gate , the current oscillates with the quasi - particle period , and these oscillations survive in the thermodynamic limit . thereby , the byers - yang paradox is resolved . an important result of our analysis is to predict the screening of the magnetic flux through the hole in a corbino disk by the qh liquid . since this effect has a topological character , i.e. , does not depend on the distribution of the flux inside the hole and the sample geometry , our prediction also holds in a homogeneous magnetic field . thus , the effect of topological screening can be tested , in principle , in an experiment with an mz interferometer by changing the area of the hole with a modulation gate but preserving the area of the qh liquid inside the interferometer , as shown in fig . . we predict that , after the application of a gate voltage , the periodicity of the current as a function of the homogeneous magnetic field will not change , contrary to a naive expectation that the period depends on the total area of the interferometer . this is because the flux through the hole is screened and the ab phase is proportional to the area of the 2deg enclosed by the interferometer paths . the last fact leads also to another important prediction : in a strongly disordered system stuck on a qh plateau , the topological screening leads to a linear dependence of the ab period ( measured in ab oscillations , as a function of the homogeneous magnetic field ) on the filling factor . this is because by changing the filling factor we also change the area of the qh liquid inside the interferometer , even if the interfering paths are fixed . we stress that our predictions also apply to a qh system at the plateau , where the measurements can be done more easily ( see also the discussion in sec . ) . our paper is organized as follows . in sec . we construct the ground state wave function of an mz interferometer in the fractional qh effect regime and discuss the effects of a singular magnetic flux and of a modulation gate . in sec . , by projecting the microscopic hamiltonian and tunneling operators onto the subspace of states corresponding to small incompressible deformations of a qh liquid , we derive the low - energy theory of the mz interferometer . then , in sec . , we compare the description derived from our microscopic theory with the one provided by the effective chern - simons theory . in sec . we use the low - energy effective hamiltonian in order to find the density matrix of the mz interferometer strongly coupled to ohmic reservoirs and to evaluate the charge current in the presence of a singular magnetic flux and of a modulation gate . we then discuss physical consequences of topological screening and propose simple experiments to test our predictions in sec . . finally , in appendix , we discuss the commutation relations for the quasi - particle operators and for tunneling operators , which are important ingredients of our theory . in this section we construct the many - particle wave functions of the ground state and of gapless excited states of an mz interferometer . we do this step by step , starting from the laughlin wave function and manipulating it , in order to arrive at a realistic model of the interferometer . we first present the most important results before we prove them , in sec . , using the classical plasma analogy . the variational wave function , proposed by laughlin in ref . and later justified by haldane and rezayi in ref . , describes an approximate ground state , , of a qh system with electrons at filling factor : here denotes a set of complex coordinates describing the position of the electron , , and is the magnetic length . it is known that the wave function  describes a circular droplet of a qh liquid of constant density and of radius . in the next step , we add to the state  a macroscopic number , , of laughlin quasi - particles at the point : in sec . we explicitly show that the wave function  describes a qh state of constant electron density inside a corbino disk , as shown in fig . the inner hole of the disk is centered at and has a radius , while the outer radius of the disk is given by . we stress that the sample geometry so obtained is not symmetric under rotations around the axis through the origin perpendicular to the sample plane , for . we deliberately break the axial symmetry in order to avoid accidental effects of symmetry and to come closer to a realistic model of an interferometer ( see fig . , lower panel ) . additional small incompressible deformations of the qh liquid disk may be described as follows . we note that all states of the lowest landau level can be described by holomorphic functions of electron coordinates . we therefore look for a wave function of the form \\langle \\,|n , m\\rangle , \\ ] ] where the function \\ ] ] is analytic inside the corbino disk ( shown in fig . ) , and denotes a set of parameters , . in sec . we show that the shape of the deformed disk is given by the solution of a two - dimensional electrostatic problem , with playing the role of an external potential . we utilize the wave function  in two ways . first of all , small incompressible deformations are known to be the gapless excitations of the qh state. therefore , in order to describe the low - energy physics , we will use the wave functions  to project the microscopic hamiltonian of the mz interferometer onto the subspace corresponding to incompressible deformations . second , we investigate the effect a modulation gate located near one of the arms of the interferometer . if a negative potential is applied to such a gate , the 2deg is depleted locally . in sec . we show that the following choice of wave function \\langle \\,|n , m\\rangle , \\ ] ] with , describes the local deformation of a corbino disk near the point , on its outer edge . this deformation is parameterized by the total magnetic flux through the depleted region and the location , , of the gate . finally , after the adiabatic insertion of a singular magnetic flux through the hole in the corbino disk at the point , the wave function is multiplied by the phase factor ] , we obtain the commutation relations : = {m}\\delta {kk'}\\delta {ss'}. \\ ] ] similarly , one finds that = = 0 ] . thus , expanding the logarithms in power series on the outer edge , , and on the inner edge , , we arrive at the following expression for the matrix elements  : \\\\ \\times\\int \\prod id^2z i ( z^* i - z^* 0)\\exp\\left\\ { -\\sum {k>0}\\left \\right\\ } \\langle n , m,\\,|\\,\\rangle \\langle \\,|n , m',\\,\\rangle . \\ ] ] here we have assumed for simplicity that tunneling points are close to each other and have set . taking into account that and , we pull out of the integral the power series in . then we use the fact that to rewrite the expression  in the following form : \\\\ \\times\\exp\\left\\{-\\sum {k>0}\\left\\right\\}\\langle n , m+1,\\,|n , m',\\,\\rangle . \\ ] ] one can immediately see that the matrix element  vanishes unless . finally , using expression  for the logarithm of the norm and definition  , we can write the projection of the tunneling operator  in terms of the deformation operators as follows : , \\ ] ] where all the constant multiplicative factors are absorbed into a prefactor , and we have introduced the following notations : ,\\ ] ] .\\ ] ] to complete our description of the low - energy physics of the interferometer we must find the projection of the operators of electron tunneling from the quantum hall edges to the ohmic contacts . this can be done by applying the technique used above to the electron annihilation operator  . the result of the projection is given by \\\\ \\times\\exp\\big \\ ] ] for tunneling from the outer edge to the upper ohmic contact ( see fig . for notations ) , while the tunneling operator on the inner edge is given by \\\\ \\times\\exp\\big , \\ ] ] to conclude this section we note that one can find the projected charge density operators at the edges of a qh system , and , by rewriting the result  directly in terms of the operators  : here the homogeneous contributions describe the charge accumulation caused by the variation of quantum numbers and . expressions  lead to the following commutation relations = \\pm {mr s } \\delta(\\theta - \\theta s){\\cal a}(\\xi),\\ ] ] where the angles and parametrize the position of the tunneling point in coordinates of the inner and outer edge . these commutation relations show that the tunneling operator  creates a pair of point - like charges of magnitude . similarly , one can check that the operators  and  create a unit charge at the corresponding edge . expressions ( - ) complete the projection procedure ( see also appendix ) . the resulting low - energy theory agrees well with the effective theory of refs . and . having outlined a self - consistent procedure for the projection of observables onto low - energy states , we next consider the projection of the edge hamiltonian and of the tunneling operators in the situation where a magnetic flux is threading through the interferometer . first , we consider the situation where the flux is varied by application of a modulation gate voltage . the wave function of the interferometer in this situation is given by eq .  , and the edge density in this state is given by eq .  . similarly to eq .  , we define deformations of the ground state  as follows : \\langle \\,|n , m\\rangle , \\ ] ] where describes the local deformation of a corbino disk near the point , on its outer edge . the scalar products of these states can be deduced from eq .  . they are given by the following expression : , \\ ] ] where , for , and , for . using the result  , one concludes that the algebra of deformation operators  does not change after the application of a gate voltage . next , we find that the edge density in the state  coincides with the result  , but with replaced by . this does not affect the energy of small deformations , which is still bilinear in the coefficients . therefore , the only effect of the modulation gate on the edge hamiltonian , up to irrelevant constants , is given by : we can also find the projection of the tunneling operators by applying the shift to formula  , which yields \\\\\\times \\exp \\big . \\ ] ] thus , we note that , after an application of a gate voltage , the tunneling operators at the left qpc and at the right qpc acquire a relative phase ] is then given by hall s law : where is the hall conductivity . thus , we conclude that , for an infinitely extended liquid , the action  correctly describes the qh effect at . however , in the situation where a qh liquid is confined to a finite region , the effective action for the qh liquid in the presence of an external electromagnetic field , = {4\\pi m}\\int {d}d^3r\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\big\\partial \\nu b \\lambda , \\ ] ] is not gauge invariant. namely , one easily sees that , under a gauge transformation , , the action  transforms as \\to s+\\delta s ] of the bulk fields over the interference contour upon variation of the singular flux . the second one is proportional to the charge ] , , are the equilibrium correlation functions of the oscillator modes . we recall that is the total number of electrons in the corbino disk , and and are the 2d coordinates of the qpcs . note that the magnetic flux enters the tunneling rates  , in particular , via the energy difference . in the next two sections we use eqs .  and  for the energy in order to investigate the flux dependence of the tunneling rates in different situations . in the case where the flux through the interferometer is varied with the help of a modulation gate we use eq .  to evaluate the energy difference between the final and initial state : in this situation , an additional flux dependence is due to the tunneling operators and at the left and right qpcs , which acquire a relative phase given by eq .  , which , for convenience , we rewrite here : ] . we stress that the contribution of the commutator of zero modes is crucial in the above calculations . the zero modes in part related to the bulk chern - simons field ( see the discussion at the end of sec . ) and naturally take into account the topology of the interferometer . finally , we note that the results  and  provide a microscopic justification of the model of the mz interferometer that we proposed in ref . we have argued there that tunneling operators , derived from the effective theory of the qh edge states , do not need to commute , because the presence of a gap in the spectrum of bulk excitations of the incompressible qh liquid makes them nonlocal . importantly , we do not see any evidence of the klein factors in tunneling operators  , when expressed in terms of the quasi - particle operators  . very recently , unexpected values of quasi - particle charges , determined via shot noise measurements , have been reported in m. dolev , y. gross , y. c. chung , m. heiblum , v. umansky , and d. mahalu , arxiv:0911.3023 . these results may indicate that the fano factor of a weak backscattering current is not determined solely by the quasi - particle charge . the use of the term `` charge fractionalization '' in this context is somewhat unfortunate , because , in contrast to the quasi - particle fractionalization , the corresponding process is completely classical in nature . in fact , it is very similar to the displacement current in electrical circuits . j. a. simmons , h. p. wei , l. w. engel , d. c. tsui , and m. shayegan , phys . lett . * 63 * , 1731 ( 1989 ) ; j. a. simmons , s. w. hwang , d. c. tsui , h. p. wei , l. w. engel , and m. shayegan , phys . rev . b * 44 * , 12933 ( 1991 ) ; f. e. camino , w. zhou and v.j . goldman , phys . lett . * 95 * , 246802 ( 2005 ) ; f. e. camino , w. zhou and v.j . goldman , phys . b * 72 * , 075342 ( 2005 ) ; f. e. camino , w. zhou and v.j . goldman , phys . * 98 * , 076805 ( 2007 ) ; f. e. camino , w. zhou and v.j . goldman , phys . b * 74 * , 115301 ( 2006 ) ; r. l. willett , l. n. pfeiffer , k. w. west , pnas * 106 * , 8853 ( 2009 ) ; r. l. willett , l. n. pfeiffer , k. w. west , , arxiv:0911.0345 . i. neder , m. heiblum , y. levinson , d. mahalu , and v. umansky , phys . * 96 * , 016804 ( 2006 ) ; i. neder , f. marquardt , m. heiblum , d. mahalu , and v. umansky , nature physics * 3 * , 534 ( 2007 ) ; e. bieri , correlation and interference experiments with edge states , phd thesis , university of basel ( oct . 2007 ) ; e. bieri , m. weiss , o. goktas , m. hauser , c. schonenberger , and s. oberholzer , phys . rev . b 79 , 245324 ( 2009 ) ; p. roulleau , f. portier , d.c . glattli , p. roche , a. cavanna , g. faini , u. gennser , and d. mailly , phys . b * 76 * , 161309(r ) ( 2007 ) ; p. roulleau , f. portier , d.c . glattli , p. roche , a. cavanna , g. faini , u. gennser , and d. mailly , phys . * 100 * , 126802 ( 2008 ) ; l.v . litvin , h .- tranitz , w. wegscheider , and c. strunk , phys . b * 75 * , 033315 ( 2007 ) ; l.v . litvin , a. helzel , h .- tranitz , w. wegscheider , and c. strunk , phys . b * 78 * , 075303 ( 2008 ) . b. blok , x.g . wen , phys . b * 43 * , 8337 ( 1991 ) ; i. kogan , a.m. perelomov and g.w . semenoff , phys . rev . b * 45 * , 12084 ( 1992 ) ; v. gurarie , c. nayak , nucl . b * 506 * , 685 ( 1997 ) ; r. de gail , n. regnault , and m. o. goerbig , phys . b * 77 * , 165310 ( 2008 ) . to be precise , the operators  are not unitary if and are finite . however , in the thermodynamic limit  these operators become unitary and satisfy the commutation relations  . note that the states at the inner and outer edge have opposite chiralities . at the same time , we choose the coordinate to run counter - clockwise at the both edges . this leads to the opposite signs of the commutators  of fields and , and to different signs in the expressions for edge densities and in terms of these fields , as e.g. , in eqs .  . the zero modes ( , , and in our notations ) and the oscillator modes are usually treated separately in the literature on the qh edge theory ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . here we follow our previous works and combine them in a single - field operator , because this simplifies the commutation relations and the edge hamiltonian . the notion of the thermodynamic limit for a mz interferometer requires some clarification . indeed , this type of interferometers are typically considered to be open quantum systems , as illustrated in the upper panel of fig . . in reality , however , electronic mz interferometers based on a qh liquid are finite size systems . this is because they are connected to an ohmic contact , located inside the interferometer ( see the lower panel of fig . ) . nevertheless , it is reasonable to assume that the coupling of a mz interferometer to ohmic contacts is strong . therefore , unless specified otherwise , we model this situation by taking the limit , where , i.e. , assuming that the level spacing at the both edges is small compared to temperature .", "summary": "interference of fractionally charged quasi - particles is expected to lead to aharonov - bohm oscillations with periods larger than the flux quantum . however , according to the byers - yang theorem , observables of an electronic system are invariant under adiabatic insertion of a quantum of singular flux . we resolve this seeming paradox by considering a microscopic model of an electronic mach - zehnder interferometer made from a quantum hall liquid at filling factor . such interferometers have the shape of a corbino disk and utilize quantum hall edge states in place of optical beams and quantum point contacts as beam splitters connecting different edge channels . an approximate ground state of such an interferometer is described by a laughlin type wave function , and low - energy excitations are incompressible deformations of this state . we construct a low - energy effective theory by projecting the state space of the liquid onto the space of such incompressible deformations and show that the theory of the quantum hall edge so obtained is a generalization of a chiral conformal field theory . amplitudes of quasi - particle tunneling in this theory are found to be insensitive to the magnetic flux threading through the hole in the corbino disk . this behavior is a consequence of topological screening of the singular flux by the quantum hall liquid . we describe strong coupling of the edges of the liquid to ohmic contacts and the resulting quasi - particle current through the interferometer with the help of a master equation . as a function of the singular magnetic flux , the current oscillates with the electronic period , i.e. , our theory conforms to the byers - yang theorem . these oscillations , which originate from the coulomb blockade effect , are suppressed with increasing system size . in contrast , when the magnetic flux through the interferometer is varied with a modulation gate , current oscillations have the quasi - particle period and survive in the thermodynamic limit ."}
{"article": "the increasing ability of the direct -body method to provide reliable models of the dynamical evolution of star clusters has closely mirrored increases in computing power ( heggie 2011 ) . the community has progressed from small- models performed on workstations ( e.g. von hoerner 1963 ; mcmillan , hut & makino 1990 ; giersz & heggie 1997 ) to models of old open clusters and into the regime ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) by making use of special - purpose grape hardware ( makino 2002 ) . software advances over a similar timeframe have produced sophisticated codes ( aarseth 1999 ; portegies zwart et al . 2001 ) that increase the realism of the models by incorporating stellar and binary evolution , binary formation , three - body effects and external potentials . as a result , -body models have been used in numerous ways to understand the evolution of globular clusters ( gcs : vesperini & heggie 1997 ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ; zonoozi et al . 2011 ) , even though the best models still only touch the lower end of the gc mass - function ( see aarseth 2003 and heggie & hut 2003 for a more detailed review of previous work ) . at the other end of the spectrum , monte carlo ( mc ) models have proven effective at producing dynamical models of particles ( giersz & heggie 2011 ) . these models have shown that clusters previously defined as non - core - collapse can actually be in a fluctuating post - core - collapse phase ( heggie & giersz 2008 ) . in practice the two methods are complimentary with mc informing the more laborious -body approach ( such as refining initial conditions ) and -body calibrating aspects of mc . in this paper we present an -body simulation of star cluster evolution that begins with stars and binaries . this extends the parameter space covered by direct -body models and performs two important functions . firstly it provides a new calibration point for the mc method this statistical method is increasingly valid for increasing so calibrations at higher are more reliable . it also allows us to further develop our theoretical understanding of star cluster evolution and investigate how well inferences drawn from models of smaller scale to larger values . the latter is the focus of this current paper . a good example of the small- models that we wish to compare with is the comprehensive study of star cluster evolution presented by giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) using models that included a mass function , stellar evolution and the tidal field of a point - mass galaxy , albeit starting with stars instead of . more recent examples for comparison include baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) and kpper et al . we were also motivated to produce a model that exhibited core - collapse close to a hubble time without dissolving by that time . what we find when interpreting this model is that much of the behaviour reported previously for smaller -body models stands up well in comparison but that the actions of a binary comprised of two black holes ( bhs ) provides a late twist to the evolution of the cluster core . in section 2 we describe the setup of the model . this is followed by a presentation of the results in sections 3 to 7 focussing on general evolution ( cluster mass and structure ) , the impact of the bh - bh binary , mass segregation , velocity distributions and binaries ( binary fraction and binding energies ) . throughout these sections the results are discussed and compared to previous work where applicable . then in section 8 we specifically look at how the evolution timescale of the new model compares to findings presented in the past . for our simulation we used the nbody4 code ( aarseth 1999 ) on a grape-6 board ( makino 2002 ) located at the american museum of natural history . nbody4 uses the 4th - order hermite integration scheme and an individual timestep algorithm to follow the orbits of cluster members and invokes regularization schemes to deal with the internal evolution of small- subsystems ( see aarseth 2003 for details ) . stellar and binary evolution of the cluster stars are performed in concert with the dynamical integration as described in hurley et al . ( 2001 ) . the simulation started with single stars and binaries . we will refer to this as the k200 model . the binary fraction of 0.025 is guided by the findings of davis et al . ( 2008 ) which indicated a present day binary fraction of for the globular cluster ngc , measured near the half - light radius of the cluster . as shown in hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) and discussed in hurley et al . ( 2008 ) , this can be taken as representative of the initial binary fraction of the cluster . thus we adopted this value for our model . validation of the binary fraction approach will be provided in section 7 . masses for the single stars were drawn from the initial mass function ( imf ) of kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) between the mass limits of 0.1 and . each binary mass was chosen from the imf of kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1991 ) , as this had not been corrected for the effect of binaries , and the component masses were set by choosing a mass - ratio from a uniform distribution . in nbody4 we assume that all stars are on the zero - age main sequence when the simulation begins and that any residual gas from the star formation process has been removed . a metallicity of was set for all stars . the orbital separations of the primordial binaries were drawn from the log - normal distribution suggested by eggleton , fitchett & tout ( 1989 ) with a peak at au and a maximum of au . orbital eccentricities of the primordial binaries were assumed to follow a thermal distribution ( heggie 1975 ) . for the tidal field of the parent galaxy we have used the point - mass galaxy approach with the model cluster on a circular orbit at kpc with an orbital velocity of . in setting we have been primarily guided by a desire for the cluster to have its moment of core - collapse between gyr . previous experience suggested that kpc would provide this for a model starting with . we used a plummer density profile ( plummer 1911 ; aarseth , hnon & wielen 1974 ) and assumed the stars and binaries are in virial equilibrium when assigning the initial positions and velocities . the plummer profile formally extends to infinite radius so in practice a cut - off at a radius of is applied , where is the half - mass radius . this is to avoid rare cases of large distance in the initial distribution . the tidal field sets a tidal radius according to : where is the gravitational constant and is the cluster mass ( see giersz & heggie 1997 ) . we chose the -body length - scale of our model so that the outermost star of the initial model sits at . this reflects the expansion expected when gas leftover from star formation is removed from the potential well ( which we do not model ) , hence our initial model should be more radially extended than a compact protocluster . stars were removed from the simulation when their distance from the density centre exceeds twice that of the tidal radius of the cluster . with these choices the initial parameters of the k200 model were , pc and pc . the half - mass relaxation timescale of the initial model was myr . much of the behaviour of this model will be compared to that reported by hurley et al . ( 2008 ) for a model that started with single stars and binaries . this will be referred to as the k100 model . the k100 model was placed on a circular orbit about a point - mass galaxy at a radial distance of kpc . it had the same number of binaries as the k200 model but twice the binary fraction . the parameters of the stars and binaries were set up in the same manner as described above for the k200 model . model orbiting at kpc ( solid line ) , the hurley et al . ( 2008 ) ( k100 ) model orbiting at kpc ( dashed line ) and a model orbiting at kpc ( dotted line ) . ,width=317 ] in figure we look at the evolution of the total cluster mass with time for the k200 model . this simulation was stopped for analysis at gyr having satisfied the goal of providing a post - core - collapse model ( see below ) at the approximate age of a milky way globular cluster . at this point the model cluster has lost of its initial mass . in terms of stars remaining at gyr the k200 model has comprised of single stars and binaries . we include the evolution of the k100 model from hurley et al . ( 2008 ) in figure and see that at gyr the two model clusters have the same amount of mass remaining ( after starting with a factor of two difference ) . for comparison we also show in figure a model that started with stars on the same orbit as the k200 model . as expected this model does not last for a hubble time and is completely dissolved after about gyr . the slope in the mass - age plane is similar to that of the k200 model and distinct from that of the k100 model with kpc . an investigation of the mass - loss rates and dissolution times of star clusters as a function of orbit within the galaxy will be the subject of another paper ( madrid et al . 2012 ) . figure shows the behaviour of the core radius , the half - mass radius and the tidal radius as the k200 model evolves . both the half - mass and core radii show an initial increase corresponding to stellar evolution mass - loss from massive stars , which are mostly found in the inner regions of the cluster . the half - mass radius then plateaus before appearing to follow the decreasing trend of the tidal radius at later times . at gyr we have pc which is comparable to the average effective radius found for globular clusters ( e.g. jordn et al . 2005 ) . the core - radius shows a deep minimum at gyr which we identify as the moment that the initial core - collapse phase ends . this is based purely on inspection of figure , noting that the same method looking for the first deep minimum of the density- or mass - dependent central radius has been commonly employed in the past ( e.g. baumgardt & makino 2003 ; hurley et al . 2004 ; kpper et al . 2008 ) . at this point the core density is , increased from an initial value of . subsequently the core fluctuates markedly , corresponding to post - core - collapse oscillations highlighted by heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) . however , we note that the core exhibits fluctuating behaviour leading up to the moment of core - collapse as well . -body core radius ( + symbols ) , the half - mass radius ( lower solid line ) and tidal radius ( upper solid line ) for the model . all radii are three - dimensional . the vertical dotted line at gyr denotes the time we have identified with the end of the initial core - collapse phase . ,width=317 ] the core radius in figure is the density radius commonly used in -body simulations ( casertano & hut 1985 ) , calculated from the density weighted average of the distance of each star from the density centre ( aarseth 2003 ) . following heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) we have also looked at the dynamical core radius used in their monte carlo models , calculated as where is the mass - weighted central velocity dispersion and is the central density , both calculated from the innermost 20 stars . we find that and cover a similar range at all times . in particular , for the period gyr , i.e. gyr after core - collapse , both oscillate between 0.1 to pc for the majority of the time . for reference , the radius containing the inner 1% of the cluster mass is pc over this period and is thus a good proxy for the average core radius . also following heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) we have used the autocorrelation method to determine if there is any clear periodicity in the fluctuations of the -body core radius in the gyr subsequent to core - collapse . this showed a period of about myr : greater than the crossing time ( few myr ) and less than the relaxation time ( myr ) . in comparison , heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) reported an oscillation period of myr for their -body model - body model was evolved for gyr starting from a post - collapse monte carlo model at an age of gyr . ] , although this contained more than our post - collapse k200 model and correspondingly had a higher half - mass relaxation timescale of myr . it is of interest to examine how previous -body results reported for smaller models hold up in comparison to our new model . the k100 model of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) reached a similar core radius at the end of core - collapse as did our k200 model ( pc ) , albeit at a later time ( gyr compared to gyr ) . as noted above , the average value of near core - collapse is similar to the 1% lagrangian radius for the k200 model . for the k100 model evolves similarly to the 2% lagrangian radius ( although it does dip down to the 1% radius on occasion ) and for the models of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) is at the 5% lagrangian radius or greater . thus it seems that with increasing the depth of core - collapse increases relative to the cluster mass distribution . if we look instead at scaled quantities , particularly the evolution of the ratio as a function of age scaled by the half - mass relaxation timescale , we find that the k200 and k100 simulations track each other very well . the ratio starts at and steadily decreases to an average value of at the end of core - collapse . giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) find for their models at core - collapse , noting that they use rather than the casertano & hut ( 1985 ) definition and that latter is about twice as large in the post - collapse phase for their models ( we found that the two gave similar average values ) . mcmillan ( 1993 ) performed models with , primordial binaries and a tidal field . for these models stabilized at about 0.1 in good agreement with prior models of isolated clusters ( see mcmillan 1993 for details ) . it therefore seems that this can be taken as a reliable value for clusters at the end of core - collapse ( although see the next section for mention of some unusual cases ) . a remarkable feature in figure is the sharp change in the behaviour of the core at gyr , the last deep minimum , when the size of the core suddenly increases and evolves steadily from that point onwards . this change is related to an interaction within the core involving a binary comprised of two bhs . the binary in question is non - primordial . each bh formed from a massive single star within the first myr of evolution with masses of and , respectively . the two bhs formed a binary at myr in a four - body interaction , initially with a very high eccentricity and long orbital period of d . it resided in the core for the majority of its lifetime and suffered a series of perturbations and interactions that saw the eccentricity vary between 0.2 to 0.95 and the orbital period reduced to d at myr . at that time the bh - binary becomes embroiled in a strong interaction with a binary comprised of two main - sequence stars ( masses of and ) . the second binary is broken - up and the two main - sequence stars are ejected rapidly from the cluster ( velocities of and ) . this causes a recoil of the bh - binary which leaves the core and then the cluster entirely ( myr later with a velocity of ) . the domination of the central region of the cluster by this bh - binary and its subsequent ejection are similar to the processes described by aarseth ( 2012 ) . the sudden loss of mass from the core the average mass drops by 30% ( see next section ) combined with the rapid ejection of the two main - sequence stars causes the core to expand . we see that after this event the core radius does start to decrease once more but without fluctuations . thus , the influence of one strong interaction involving a massive binary has halted the core oscillation process . compared to the point that we identified as the end of the initial core - collapse phase the core radius has increased by a factor of about six . the structure of globular clusters is often quantified by the concentration parameter ( king 1966 ) . milky way gcs exhibit a range of values ( harris 1996 ) with the most obvious core collapse examples having but with generally taken as indicative of a high - density cluster or a possible core - collapse cluster ( mateo 1987 ) . at the end of the core - collapse phase our k200 model has and this decreases to after the bh - binary is ejected from the core . thus , the cluster would not be expected to appear as a core - collapse cluster if observed at this point . hurley ( 2007 ) showed that the presence of a long - lived bh - bh binary in the core , with both bhs being of stellar mass , could significantly increase the ratio of a model with stars . the bh - bh binary in our model has not produced a similar inflation of the ratio . mackey et al . ( 2007 ) performed -body simulations with in which they retained stellar mass bhs . they found that the bhs formed a dense core in which interactions were common and bhs could be ejected from the cluster , leading to a significantly inflated core radius . it is our intention in the near future to look at a wide range of -body simulations and document in detail the statistics and outcomes of bh - bh binaries in the cores of model clusters . this will include fitting king ( 1966 ) models to the density profiles of the model clusters so as to properly calculate the concentration parameter rather than using -body values as we have done here in our preliminary analysis . model . the vertical dotted line marks the end of the initial core - collapse phase as in figure . ,width=317 ] figure looks at how the average stellar mass behaves for the k200 model , focussing on four different lagrangian regions : a central volume that encompasses the inner 1% of the cluster mass , a central shell that lies between radii enclosing 1% and 10% of the cluster mass , an intermediate shell that lies between the 10% and 50% lagrangian radii , and an outer shell that includes all stars beyond the 50% lagrangian radius . note that binaries are included and are assumed to be unresolved . the average stellar mass throughout the entire cluster is at the start of the simulation there is no primordial mass segregation and drops initially in all regions owing to stellar evolution mass - loss of massive stars for the first myr . we then see that the effect of mass segregation driven by two - body encounters takes over , causing an increase in the average stellar mass in the inner regions and a corresponding decrease in the outer region . by the time that one half - mass relaxation timescale has elapsed ( myr ) there is a clear distinction between the average mass in each of the regions . in the central regions the average stellar mass continues to increase up to the end of core - collapse and then flattens post - collapse ( until the ejection of the bh - bh binary ) . the value in the very centre is noisy owing to a smaller number of objects and the cycling of these objects in and out of the region . we see a marked increase in this central value as the cluster gets closer to the end of core - collapse ( note the correlation with in figure ) . the decreasing average mass in the outer region is gradually arrested by the effect of the external tide which preferentially removes the lower - mass stars that have been pushed out to this region . we see that from myr onwards the average mass in the outer region is now increasing and that this effect is also felt in the intermediate region . but now showing the velocity dispersion . ,width=317 ] if we instead look at the behaviour in two - dimensional projected regions we find that the average mass is the same in the two outermost regions but drops by about 5% in the 1 - 10% region and 10 - 15% in the central region ( after the first gyr ) . giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) look at the evolution of average mass in different regions , as we have done in figure . they see very similar behaviour which can be summarised as : ( i ) a sharp increase of the average mass within the 1% lagrangian region towards core - collapse ; ( ii ) a decrease in the outer regions that flattens out with time and then increases at late times ; and ( iii ) similar trends in the intermediate regions . however , in their models they find that the timescale for the initial phase of mass segregation is about the same as the core - collapse timescale , whereas we find that mass segregation is fully established well before core - collapse . the models of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) agree with our k200 model in that respect and with the general behaviour , including the flattening of the average mass in the central regions post - collapse . but now showing the anisotropy parameter . ,width=317 ] in figure we show the velocity dispersion for the same lagrangian regions as in figure . all regions show a rapid initial decrease owing to an overall expansion of the cluster . this is followed by a more gradual decrease as the cluster evolves towards core - collapse , with all regions declining in an almost homologous manner . as the model cluster nears the end of core - collapse there is a pronounced upturn in the velocity dispersion within the 1% radius . this is also seen out to the 10% radius and even at the half - mass radius , although to a much smaller extent . note that the behaviour for two - dimensional velocities in projected lagrangian regions is the same but with values that are typically 20% less . the main features of our new model mirror those in the smaller- models of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) . these features are the following : the values within the 1% and 10% regions overlap ; the velocity dispersion in the outer regions is clearly lower than for these inner regions ; and the values for the 50% region are much closer to those of the inner regions than the outer regions . another aspect of velocity to consider is the anisotropy . we have chosen to define this as the ratio of the mean square transverse to radial velocity components , ( as in giersz & heggie 1997 ) and the result is shown in figure . in three dimensions this is equal to two for isotropy , greater than two for a tangentially anisotropic distribution and less than two for a radially anisotropic distribution . an alternative is to use the anisotropy parameter ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ; wilkinson et al . 2003 ) where is isotropic , is tangentially anisotropic and is radially anisotropic . we see from figure that the inner regions of the cluster remain close to isotropic throughout the evolution while the outer region develops an increasing tangential anisotropy over the first gyr and then flattens out to a constant value for the remainder of the evolution . this overall behaviour is similar to that observed by baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) in their models . it is also similar to the behaviour for the k100 model , although the degree of anisotropy in the outer region is about 30% less than in the k200 model . also , because the k100 model is evolved well past core - collapse it is possible to see that the anisotropy is reduced post - collapse and tends towards isotropy in the final stages of evolution ( as was noted by baumgardt & makino 2003 ) . the tangential anisotropy in the outer region is contrary to previous findings of radial anisotropy for smaller- models ( giersz & heggie 1997 ; wilkinson et al . tangential anisotropy can be explained by stars expelled from the central regions on radial orbits preferentially escaping from the cluster at the expense of stars on tangential orbits which find it harder to escape . in the very central region ( within the 1% lagrangian radius ) the anisotropy parameter is very noisy and fluctuates between radial and tangential anisotropy . however , the average behaviour is isotropy . model . shown are the binary fraction of the entire cluster ( dashed line ) , within the 10% lagrangian radius ( black dotted line ) and within the core ( red solid line ) . also shown is the binary fraction of main - sequence stars and binaries near the half - mass radius ( red dotted line : which closely follows the binary fraction of the entire cluster ) . compare with figure 3 of hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) . the vertical dotted line once again marks the end of the initial core - collapse phase as in figure . ,width=317 ] hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) documented the evolution of binary fraction with time for a range of -body models covering to and primordial binary fractions from 0.05 to 0.5 . in all cases they found that the binary fraction within the cluster core and the 10% lagrangian radius increases as the cluster evolves towards core - collapse while the overall binary fraction of the cluster stays close to the primordial value . figure shows the same evolution for the k200 model . similar results are seen in that the core binary fraction increases markedly as the cluster evolves , particularly towards core - collapse when it becomes a factor of six or more greater than the primordial value , while the overall binary fraction does stay close to the primordial value ( although the inclusion of a large proportion of initially wide binaries would lead to an initial decrease ) . this gives added confidence in the results of hurley , aarseth & shara ( 2007 ) although models of greater ( and density ) are still required before the situation for the majority of the milky way globular clusters can be firmly established . davis et al . ( 2008 ) measured the binary fraction amongst main - sequence stars near the half - mass radius of ngc and found it to be a few per cent . this was taken as representative of the primordial binary fraction of ngc by leaning on the result from hurley et al . ( 2008 ) showing that the binary fraction measured near the half - mass radius of a cluster can be taken as a good indication of the primordial binary fraction . this is reinforced in figure for our k200 model where we show that the binary fraction of main - sequence stars and binaries near the half - mass radius of the cluster stays at roughly the same value throughout the evolution . the vertical dotted line denotes the time identified with the end of the initial core - collapse phase for this model . ,width=317 ] but now for the k100 model . the vertical dotted line denotes the time identified with the end of the initial core - collapse phase for this model . ,width=317 ] next we look at the energy in binaries for the k200 simulation in figure and for the k100 simulation in figure . here we see that for the % lagrangian mass regions the values and behaviour for the two simulations are very similar . as expected the average energy per binary increases as we move inwards towards the cluster centre , although the values within the 1 - 10% and 10 - 50% regions are converging towards the end of the simulation . we note that the binary binding energy is calculated in arbitrary yet physical units of to enable direct comparison between the internal energies of the two binary populations . conversion to cluster units of t based on the average kinetic energy of the cluster stars ( e.g. mcmillan 1993 ) increases the k100 values by a factor of three compared to the k200 values , i.e. the binaries have relatively more internal energy in the simulation with less stars . sharp dips in the binding energy occur throughout the simulations when binaries escape ( as documented by kpper , kroupa & baumgardt 2008 ) although these are less evident in figure owing to less frequent sampling . the energy per binary in the inner 1% region by mass starts off similarly for both simulations , oscillating about the 1 - 10% values . however , the influence of the bh - binary in the k200 simulation from gyr onwards is clear to see , increasing the average energy by almost two orders of magnitude before a sharp drop when the binary is removed from the core . noticeable increases in binding energy are also evident at other times and arise from the creation of tight binaries by various means . for example , the spike in the 50 - 100% lagrangian region at myr in figure results from a primordial binary in which common - envelope evolution creates a short - period binary comprised of two white dwarfs which subsequently come into contact and merge . thus the binary dominates the energy in this region for a short time and then disappears . we see a more persistent increase in the average energy within the 1% region at myr in figure . this is caused when a main - sequence star and a black hole form a short - period binary via an exchange interaction . the binary survives for about myr in the cluster core before the main - sequence star is consumed by the black hole . it is worthwhile to ask if the signatures of these short - lived energetic binaries be observed ? the binary that resulted in the merger of two wds did not produce a wd with a mass in excess of the chandrasekhar limit so could not be a potential type ia supernova ( see shara & hurley 2002 ) . however , the resulting wd will be relatively massive , hot and young . thus it could be expected to remain one of the brightest wds in the cluster for several gyrs and would be easily observed . the other binary mentioned resulted in a main - sequence star being tidally disrupted and swallowed by a black - hole of . this could be expected to give rise to a burst of x - rays and perhaps gamma - rays , along the lines of burrows et al . ( 2011 : albeit for a supermassive black hole ) . . comparison of core - collapse , , and relaxation timescales , , for the k200 and k100 simulations . note that the averaged is calculated to gyr and gyr for the k200 and k100 simulations , respectively . also shown is the time for the cluster to lose half of the initial mass , . timescales for star cluster evolution are important to understand , with the time until core - collapse and the time until dissolution being quantities of interest ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . furthermore , the scaling of these with or related properties of clusters / models is necessary ( baumgardt 2001 ) , particularly while direct models of globular clusters remain out of reach . in table we summarize the significant timescales for the k200 and k100 simulations : the time for half of the initial mass to be lost , the time until the end of the core - collapse phase and the half - mass relaxation time at various key points . kpper et al . ( 2008 ) presented a range of open cluster models in a steady tidal field and found that the core - collapse time scaled by the initial half - mass relaxation time ranged from 17 for clusters starting well within their tidal radii ( smaller ) to 9 for clusters that fill their tidal radii from the start ( larger ) . our k200 model and the k100 model of hurley et al . ( 2008 ) start by filling their tidal radius and have which is in good agreement with kpper et al . ( 2008 ) . baumgardt ( 2001 ) looked at the scaling of -body models using simulations of up to equal - mass stars . in this work the time for a cluster to lose half of its mass , , was taken as an indication of the cluster lifetime with shown to be the appropriate scaling . baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) subsequently used their larger- models ( up to stars ) to once again show that scaling the dissolution time as is appropriate , this time for multi - mass models that included stellar evolution . however , we see from table that the half - mass relaxation time varies considerably across the lifetime of a cluster and it is not immediately clear which value to use when scaling timescales . for an observed cluster it will be the value at the current age of the cluster . a fairer comparison would be to use the average half - mass relaxation time across the lifetime of the cluster , of course this is not known for an observed cluster . for the k200 and k100 models we find that is the same for both simulations , so the agreement for this key timescale is in excellent agreement with the previous suggestion . we also find that scales quite well with . however , if we instead use then we do not find good agreement for either the core - collapse or half - life timescales . thus our agreement with the scalings found in previous works is dependent on which is used . we have presented an -body model that started with stars and binaries , evolves to the moment of core - collapse at gyr and has stars remaining at gyr . we have used our direct -body model to confirm the post - core - collapse fluctuations described in the monte carlo model of heggie & giersz ( 2008 ) and the hybrid -body / mc approach of heggie & giersz ( 2009 ) . we have also shown that these fluctuations can be halted by the ejection of a dominant bh - binary from the core . this produces a core that shows no sign that it has previously evolved through core - collapse . we have looked at how the results of previous works compare to a model of larger and find good agreement provided that appropriate scalings are used ( such as the core - radius to half - mass radius ratio at core - collapse ) . in terms of raw values some variations exist : the core radius at core - collapse reaches deeper in to the mass distribution for larger , for example . the behaviour of quantities such as average stellar mass and velocity dispersion have been documented and the general behaviour matches expectations from earlier models . looking at time scales such as the time to core - collapse and the dissolution time we also find agreement with scaling relations previously reported in the literature , however this is dependent on which value of the half - mass relaxation timescale is used . in particular , the scaling of dissolution time with reported by baumgardt ( 2001 ) could be reproduced provided that the average was used and not the initial . the simulation reported in this work took the best part of a year on a grape-6 board to complete . it continues the gradual increase of used in realistic -body models from the model of giersz & heggie ( 1997 ) to the model of baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) . however , with only remaining in our model at an age of gyr we are still only touching the lower end of the globular cluster mass - function . this is after considerable effort . in particular , we are still some way from the goal of a full million - body model of a globular cluster ( heggie & hut 2003 ) . how can we push forward to reach that goal ? the shift towards graphics processing units ( gpus ) as the central computing engine for -body codes , combined with sophisticated software development , offers hope ( nitadori & aarseth 2012 ) . simulations of stars can be performed comfortably on a single - gpu ( hurley & mackey 2010 ; zonoozi et al . 2011 ) and the introduction of multiple - gpu support will likely make simulations of the type presented here commonplace in the near future . further hardware advances and a revisiting of efforts to parallelize direct -body codes ( spurzem 1999 ) will also aid the push towards greater . in a follow - up paper we will conduct a full investigation of the stellar and binary populations of our model . it is also our intention to make model snapshots saved at frequent intervals across the lifetime of the simulation available for others to observe and analyse . these can be obtained by contacting the authors . at the beginning of this paper we indicated that an important function of a large- model would be to aid in the calibration of the monte carlo technique . this is currently underway ( giersz et al . 2012 ) and will include a direct comparison of -body and mc models starting from the same initial conditions . we acknowledge the generous support of the cordelia corporation and that of edward norton which has enabled amnh to purchase grape-6 boards and supporting hardware . we thank harvey richer for helping to provide the motivation for this model and ivan king for many helpful suggestions . aarseth s. j.,1999 , pasp , 111 , 1333 aarseth s.j . , 2003 , gravitational n -

energy reactions . recently , this topic is becoming important in heavy - ion collisions for investigating properties of quark - hadron matters and also in neutrino reactions for investigating neutrino - oscillation physics . determination of precise npdfs is valuable for studying various phenomena in heavy - ion reactions such as color glass condensate , suppression , and parton - energy loss . the npdf studies should be also important for heavy - ion collisions at lhc ( large hadron collider ) . in neutrino oscillation experiments , most data are taken at small ( gev ) . we could approach such a kinematical region from the high - energy deep inelastic one by using quark - hadron duality . however , there are still unresolved issues in neutrino deep inelastic scattering . for example , an anomalous value was reported in the neutrino - iron scattering by the nutev collaboration . it could be related to a nuclear modification difference between the parton distributions and because the iron target is used in the nutev measurements . there is also an issue that nuclear corrections are different from the ones expected from electron and muon scattering experiments according to recent nutev data . in these high - energy nuclear reactions , nucleonic pdfs rather than the nuclear ones are often used in calculating cross sections by neglecting nuclear modifications although it is well known that nuclear corrections could be as large as 20% in medium - size nuclei . these nuclear modifications have been experimentally investigated mainly by the measurements of structure - function ratios and drell - yan cross - section ratios . physical mechanisms of the nuclear corrections are , for example , summarized in ref . . in the small- region , the npdfs become smaller than the corresponding nucleonic ones , which is called shadowing . there are depletions at medium , which is related to the nuclear binding mechanism and possibly to a nucleonic modification inside a nuclear medium . at large , the nucleon s fermi motion gives rise to positive corrections . because the pdfs are related to the nonperturbative aspect of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , theoretical calculations have been done by lattice qcd or phenomenological models . however , such calculations are not accurate enough at this stage . one would like to have accurate npdfs , which are obtained in a model - independent way , for calculating precise nuclear cross sections . we should inevitably rely on experimental data for determining them . studies of nucleonic pdfs have a long history with abundant experimental data in a wide kinematical region . however , determination of npdfs is still at a premature stage with the following reasons . first , available experimental data are limited . the experiments of the hadron - electron ring accelerator ( hera ) provided data for structure functions at small in a wide range of ; however , such data do not exist for nuclei . because of final - state interactions , hadron - production data may not be suitable for the npdf determination , whereas they are used in the nucleonic analysis . second , the analysis technique is not established . parametrization studies for the npdfs started only recently . the npdfs are expressed in terms of a number of parameters which are then determined by a analysis of the nuclear data . however , it is not straightforward to find functional forms of mass - number  and bjorken- dependencies in the npdfs . furthermore , higher - twist effects could be important in the small- region . a useful parametrization was investigated in ref . by analyzing structure functions and drell - yan data ; however , the distributions were obtained by simply assigning appropriate parameter values by hand in the versions of 1998 and 1999 . the first analysis was reported in ref . , and then uncertainties of the npdfs were obtained . all of these analyses are done in the leading order ( lo ) of the running coupling constant . a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) analysis was recently reported . the lo analysis with the uncertainties was also investigated in the 2007 version of ref . there are related studies on the nuclear shadowing and a global analysis of structure functions . in this way , the parametrization studies have been developed recently for the npdfs , and they are not sufficient . here , we extend our studies in refs . by focusing on the following points : * nlo analysis with npdf uncertainties together with a lo one , * roles of nlo terms on the npdf determination by comparing lo and nlo results , * better determination of and dependence , * nuclear modifications in the deuteron by including data , * flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions . this article is organized as follows . in sec . , our analysis method is described for determining the npdfs . analysis results are explained in sec . . nuclear modifications in the deuteron are discussed in sec . . the results are summarized in sec . . the optimum npdfs are determined by analyzing experimental data of the structure functions and drell - yan cross sections for nuclear targets . details of our analysis method are described in refs . , so that only the outline is explained in the following . the parton distribution functions are expressed by two variables and . the variable is defined with the virtual photon momentum in the lepton scattering , and the scaling variable is given by with the nucleon mass and the energy transfer . the variables for the drell - yan process are momentum fractions , and for partons in the projectile and target , respectively , and defined by the dimuon mass as . in our analysis , the npdfs are expressed in terms of corresponding nucleonic pdfs multiplied by weight functions : the functions and indicate type- npdf and nucleonic pdf , respectively , and is a weight function which indicates a nuclear modification for the type- parton distribution . the function generally depends on not only and but also the atomic number . it should be noted that this expression sacrifices the large-  nuclear distributions . finite distributions exist even at in nuclei , whereas the distributions should vanish in the nucleon . flavor symmetric antiquark distributions are assumed for , , and in the previous analyses . from the violation of the gottfried sum rule and drell - yan measurements , it is now well known that these antiquark distributions are different . it is more natural to investigate modifications from the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions in the nucleon . in this work , flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions are used in nuclei , and the distribution type indicates , , , , , and : whereas the relation is assumed in refs . the number of flavor is three ( four ) at  . the bottom and top quark distributions are neglected . the strange - quark distributions are assumed to be symmetric  although there are recent studies on possible asymmetry . the charm - quark distributions are created by evolution effects . as for the nucleonic pdfs in the lo and nlo , the mrst ( martin , roberts , stirling , and thorne ) parametrization of 1998 is used in this analysis , where the charm - quark mass is =1.35 gev and scale parameters are =0.174 and 0.300 gev for the lo and nlo , respectively . in our previous analysis , the mrst-2001 version was employed . since the nlo gluon distribution is negative at and gev in the 2001 version , we use the 1998 parametrization in this work . negative gluon distributions in nuclei could affect our analysis inappropriately in the shadowing region . furthermore , other researchers may use our npdfs at small  with gev for calculating cross sections , for example , in lhc experiments . we tested various pdfs of the nucleon , but overall results are not significantly changed . since we are interested in obtaining the distributions at gev in comparison with other distributions and also our previous distributions , we decided to use the mrst distributions . in the analyses of the cteq ( coordinated theoretical / experimental project on qcd phenomenology and tests of the standard model ) collaboration , the initial scale =(1.3) gev is used . the nuclear modification is assumed to have the following functional form : where , , , , , and are parameters . the parameter controls the shadowing part , , , and determine a minute functional form , and is related to the fermi - motion part at large . the parameter is fixed at =0.1 because it can not be determined from a small number of data in the fermi - motion part . as it will be shown in the result section , the antiquark and gluon modifications can not be determined from the present data at . if a large , for example =1 , is taken , the antiquark and gluon distributions could become unrealistically large at large . in order to avoid such an issue , is used . the overall dependence in eq .  is taken simply by considering nuclear volume and surface contributions . there are three constraints for the parameters by the nuclear charge , baryon number , and momentum conservation : , \\nonumber \\\\ a & = \\int dx \\ , {3 } \\left , \\\\ a & = \\int dx \\ , a \\ , x \\big . \\nonumber\\ ] ] we selected three parameters , , , and , which are determined by these conditions . following improvements are made from the previous analysis . first , the parametrization of dependence is modified . the meaning of the parameters , , and is not obvious , so that it is difficult to limit the ranges of these parameters in the analysis . here , we take points ( , ) of extreme values for the function as the parameters instead of and . they are related with each other by then , the values of and become transparent at least for the valence - quark distributions . from the measurements of the ratios , where indicates the deuteron , we have a rough idea that the extreme values should be and . the drell - yan measurements indicate for the antiquark distributions . the value and the extreme values for the gluon distribution are not obvious . second , the dependence is too simple . from gross nuclear properties , the leading dependence could be described by . in order to describe more details , the parameters , , , and are taken to be dependent : because the extreme values and are almost independent of according to the data and also from the previous analyses , they are assumed to be independent of . in addition , the parameters and are fixed in the antiquark and gluon distributions as follows . because the gluon distributions can not be well determined from the present data , the parameter is taken as assumed in the previous analysis . it means that and are related by from eq .  . there are still six parameters for the antiquark distributions and they should be too many in comparison with four parameters for the valence - quark distributions . we decided to fix the parameter , which is sensitive to the gluon shadowing ratio to the antiquark one because of the momentum conservation . we found that the gluon shadowing can not be well determined even in the nlo analysis ; therefore , the value of is taken so that the gluon shadowing is similar to the antiquark shadowing . after all , the following twelve parameters are used for expressing the nuclear modifications : these parameters are determined by the following global analysis . most of used experimental data are explained in ref . first , the data for are from european muon collaboration ( emc ) , the slac ( stanford linear accelerator center)-e49 , e87 , e139 , and e140 collaborations , the bologna - cern - dubna - munich - saclay ( bcdms ) collaboration , the new muon collaboration ( nmc ) , the fermilab ( fermi national accelerator laboratory)-e665 collaboration , and the hermes . second , the ratios  are from the nmc . third , the drell - yan data are from the fermilab - e772 and e866/nusea collaborations . additional data to the hkn04 ( hirai , kumano , nagai in 2004 ) analysis are the ones for the deuteron - proton ratio . these deuteron data are added because precise nuclear modifications are needed for the deuteron which is , for example , used in heavy - ion experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . the data are taken from the measurements by the emc , the bcdms , the fermilab - e665 , and the nmc . these data are used for extracting information on the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions in the nucleon . therefore , the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions in eq .  are essential for a successful fit and for extracting information on modifications in the deuteron . because the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) evolution can be applied only in the perturbative qcd region , the data with small values can not be used in the analysis . however , the data in a relatively small- region ( =1 gev ) are valuable for determining antiquark distributions at small  . as a compromise of these conflicting conditions , only the data with gev are used in the analysis . however , one should note that the data in the range , =1 gev , may contain significant contributions of higher - twist effects which are not considered in our leading - twist analysis . the parameters are determined by fitting experimental data for the ratios of the structure functions and drell - yan cross sections . the total is minimized to obtain the optimum parameters . the ratio indicates experimental data for and , and is a theoretical ratio calculated by the parametrized npdfs . the initial scale is taken =1 gev , and the distributions in eq .  are evolved to experimental points to calculate the by the dglap evolution equations . all the calculations are done in the lo or nlo , and the modified minimal subtraction  scheme is used in the nlo analysis . the structure function is expressed in terms of the npdfs and coefficient functions : \\nonumber \\\\ & + c g(x,\\alpha s ) \\otimes g^a ( x , q^2 ) \\bigg\\ } , \\ ] ] where and are the coefficient functions , and is a quark charge . the symbol denotes the convolution integral : the proton - nucleus drell - yan cross section is given by the summation of annihilation and compton processes : they are expressed in terms of the pdfs and subprocess cross sections : \\nonumber \\\\ & \\ \\times , \\ ] ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\ \\ \\ + }{dq^2 dx f } g^a ( y 2,q^2 ) \\bigg ] . \\ ] ] the cross sections and indicate subprocess cross sections for annihilation processes in the lo and nlo , respectively . the indicates the cross section for and processes . the nlo expressions of these cross sections are , for example , found in ref . effects of possible parton - energy loss in the drell - yan process are neglected in this analysis . using these expressions for the structure functions and drell - yan cross sections , we calculate the theoretical ratios in eq .  . the total is minimized by the cern program library minuit . from this analysis , an error matrix which is the inverse of a hessian matrix , is obtained . npdf uncertainties are estimated by using the hessian matrix as ^ 2=\\delta \\chi^2 \\sum {i , j } \\left ( {\\partial \\xi i } \\right ) { \\xi= } h {ij}^{-1 } \\left ( {\\partial \\xi j } \\right ) { \\xi= } , \\ ] ] where is the hessian matrix , is a parameter , and indicates the optimum parameter set . the value determines the confidence region , and it is calculated so that the confidence level becomes the one--error range  for a given number of parameters  by assuming the normal distribution in the multiparameter space . in the analysis with the twelve parameters , it is . this hessian method has been used for estimating polarized pdfs and fragmentation functions as well as nuclear pdfs in our previous version . the details of the uncertainty analysis are discussed in refs . as well as in the nucleonic pdf articles . determined parameters are listed in table for both lo and nlo . three parameters are fixed by the constraints from baryon - number , charge , and momentum conservations in eq .  , and we chose , , and for these parameters . the values of the obtained parameters and their errors are similar in the lo and nlo . however , the errors indicate that there are slight nlo improvements in comparison with the lo results . c@c@c @c@c nucleus & reference & # of data & & + & & & ( lo ) & ( nlo ) + d / p & & 290 & 375.5 & 322.5 + he / d & & 35 & 60.9 & 51.8 + li / d & & 17 & 36.9 & 36.4 + be / d & & 17 & 39.3 & 53.0 + c / d & & 43 & 105.8 & 78.7 + n / d & & 162 & 136.3 & 121.7 + al / d & & 35 & 45.5 & 44.9 + ca / d & & 33 & 43.3 & 34.1 + fe / d & & 57 & 108.0 & 97.4 + cu / d & & 19 & 12.1 & 13.2 + kr / d & & 144 & 115.1 & 115.9 + ag / d & & 7 & 12.5 & 9.1 + sn / d & & 8 & 13.3 & 14.1 + xe / d & & 5 & 2.2 & 2.3 + au / d & & 19 & 55.6 & 32.3 + pb / d & & 5 & 5.7 & 4.5 + total & & 606 & 792.4 & 709.3 + be / c & & 15 & 12.6 & 11.9 + al / c & & 15 & 5.0 & 5.1 + ca / c & & 39 & 29.9 & 29.1 + fe / c & & 15 & 8.0 & 8.3 + sn / c & & 146 & 204.0 & 172.1 + pb / c & & 15 & 15.7 & 12.2 + c / li & & 24 & 67.4 & 64.9 + ca / li & & 24 & 69.0 & 65.3 + total & & 293 & 411.6 & 369.0 + c / d & & 9 & 9.3 & 8.1 + ca / d & & 9 & 5.8 & 13.8 + fe / d & & 9 & 12.6 & 17.9 + w / d & & 9 & 27.8 & 29.6 + fe / be & & 8 & 3.3 & 3.6 + w / be & & 8 & 14.9 & 12.1 + drell -

proton data are added in this analysis to the data set of the previous version , and they should provide a valuable constraint on pdf modifications in the deuteron . because the data are sensitive to asymmetry , flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions should be used in our analysis . if the flavor symmetric distributions are used as initial ones , the fit produces a significantly larger .

however , such deviations are not very significant in figs . , , and . there are general tendencies that medium- and large - size nuclei are well explained by our parametrization , whereas there are slight deviations for small nuclei . because any systematic deviations are not found from the experimental data , our analyses should be successful in determining the optimum nuclear pdfs . ratio and the drell - yan ratio . in the upper figures , the theoretical curves and uncertainties are calculated at =10 gev for the ratio and at =50 gev for the drell - yan ratio . the dashed and solid curves indicate lo and nlo results , and the lo and nlo uncertainties are shown by the dark- and light - shaded bands , respectively . the lower figures indicate the ratios where indicates or . here , the theoretical ratios are calculated at the experimental points . for comparison , the lo curves and their uncertainties are also shown by and .,title=\"fig:\",width=160 ] ratio and the drell - yan ratio . in the upper figures , the theoretical curves and uncertainties are calculated at =10 gev for the ratio and at =50 gev for the drell - yan ratio . the dashed and solid curves indicate lo and nlo results , and the lo and nlo uncertainties are shown by the dark- and light - shaded bands , respectively . the lower figures indicate the ratios where indicates or . here , the theoretical ratios are calculated at the experimental points . for comparison , the lo curves and their uncertainties are also shown by and .,title=\"fig:\",width=154 ] + next , actual data are compared with the lo and nlo theoretical ratios and their uncertainties for the calcium nucleus as an example in fig . . in the upper figures , the theoretical curves and the uncertainties are calculated at fixed points , =10 gev and 50 gev for the and the drell - yan , respectively , whereas the experimental data are taken at various values . the rational differences are shown together with the difference between the lo and nlo curves , , in the lower figures . the comparison suggests that both lo and nlo parametrizations should be successful in explaining the dependence of the calcium data . it is noteworthy that the nlo error band of the ratio becomes slightly smaller in comparison with the lo one at small ; however , magnitudes of both uncertainties are similar in the region , . the nlo improvement is not clearly seen in the drell - yan ratio in the range of . there are discrepancies between the theoretical curves and the data at ; however , they are simply due to differences . if the theoretical ratios are calculated at the same experimental points , they agree as shown in the part of fig . . these lo and nlo results indicate that the available data are taken in the limited range without small- data , and they are not much sensitive to nlo corrections . this fact leads to a difficulty in determining nuclear gluon distributions because the gluonic effects are typical nlo effects through the coefficient functions and in the evolution equations . one of possible methods for determining the gluon distribution in the nucleon is to investigate dependence of the structure function . because dependent data exist in the ratios , it may be possible to find nuclear modifications of the gluon distribution . -dependent data of by the hermes collaboration . the dashed and solid curves indicate lo and nlo results , and the nlo uncertainties are shown by the shaded bands.,scaledwidth=41.0% ] -dependent data of by the nmc . the notations are the same as fig . .,scaledwidth=41.0% ] the lo and nlo parametrization results are compared with dependent data for and measured by the hermes and nmc collaborations , respectively , in figs . and . the uncertainties are shown by the shaded bands in the nlo . because the lo and nlo uncertainties are similar except for the small- region , the lo ones are not shown in these figures . they are compared later in this subsection . the results indicate that overall dependencies are well explained by our parametrizations in both lo and nlo . the comparison suggests that the experimental data are not accurate enough to probe the details of the dependence . furthermore , dependencies of the hermes and nmc results are different . the hermes ratio tends to decrease with increasing at =0.035 , 0.045 , and 0.055 , whereas the nmc ratio increases with at the same points , although the nuclear species are different . this kind of difference together with inaccurate -dependent measurements makes it difficult to extract precise nuclear gluon distributions within the leading - twist dglap approach . it is reflected in large uncertainties in the gluon distributions as it becomes obvious in sec . . in our previous versions , the experimental shadowing in is underestimated at small  partly because of an assumption on a simple dependence . as shown in fig . , the shadowing is still slightly underestimated at ; however , the deviations are not as large as before . if the experimental errors and the npdf uncertainties are considered , our parametrization is consistent with the data . dependence of the ratio is compared in the lo and nlo at =0.001 , 0.01 , 0.01 , and 0.7 . the dashed and solid curves indicate lo and nlo results , and lo and nlo uncertainties are shown by the dark- and light - shaded bands , respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ] the nlo uncertainties are compared with the lo ones in fig . for the ratio . the lo and nlo ratios and their uncertainties are shown at =0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , and 0.7 . the differences between both uncertainties are conspicuous at small ( = 0.001 and 0.01 ) ; however , they are similar at larger . the lo and nlo slopes are also different at small . these results indicate that the nlo effects become important at small  , and the determination of the npdfs is improved especially in this small- region . because the nlo contributions are obvious only in the region , , it is very important to measure the dependence to pin down the nlo effects such as the gluon distributions . the possibilities are measurements at future electron facilities such as erhic and elic . nuclear modifications of the pdfs are shown for all the analyzed nuclei and at =1 gev in fig . . it should be noted that the modifications of are the same as the ones of in isoscalar nuclei , but they are different in other nuclei . the modifications increase as the nucleus becomes larger , and the dependence is controlled by the overall factor and the dependence in eq .  . the extreme values ( , ) are assumed to be independent of in our current analysis as explained in sec . , so that they are the same in fig . . although the oxygen data are not used in our global analysis , its pdfs are shown in the figure because they are useful for an application to neutrino oscillation experiments . our code is supplied at the web site in ref . for calculating the npdfs and their uncertainties at given and . ( , , , and ) are shown in the nlo for all the analyzed nuclei and at =1 gev . as the mass number becomes larger in the order of d , he , li , ... , and pb , the curves deviate from the line of unity .,width=302 ] = 1 gev . the dashed and solid curves indicate lo and nlo results , and lo and nlo uncertainties are shown by the dark- and light - shaded bands , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] = 1 gev . the dashed and solid curves indicate lo and nlo results , and lo and nlo uncertainties are shown by the dark- and light - shaded bands , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] as examples of medium and large nuclei , we take the calcium and lead and show their distributions and uncertainties at =1 gev in fig . . because the deuteron is a special nucleus and it needs detailed explanations , its results are separately discussed in sec . . the figure indicates that valence - quark distributions are determined well in the wide range , because the uncertainties are small . it is also interesting to find that the lo and nlo uncertainties are almost the same . there are following reasons for these results . the valence - quark modifications at are determined by the accurate measurements of modifications . the antishadowing part in the region , , is also determined by the data because there is almost no nuclear modification in the antiquark distributions according to the drell - yan data . if the valence - quark distributions are obtained at , the small- behavior is automatically constrained by the baryon - number and charge conservations in eq .  . because of these strong constraints , the lo and nlo results are not much different . in the near future , the jlab ( thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ) measurements will provide data which could constraint the nuclear valence - quark distribution especially at medium and large . furthermore , future neutrino measurements such as the minera experiment at fermilab and the one at a possible neutrino factory should provide important information at small  . the antiquark distributions are also well determined except for the large- region , , because there is no accurate drell - yan data and the structure functions are dominated by the valence - quark distributions . the lo and nlo uncertainties are similar except for the large- region . because of gluon contributions in the nlo , the antiquark shadowing modifications are slightly different between the lo and nlo . possible large- drell - yan measurements such as j - parc ( japan proton accelerator research complex ) and fermilab - e906 should be valuable for the nuclear antiquark distributions in the whole- range . in the similar energy region , there is also the gsi - fair ( gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung -facility for antiproton and ion research ) project . the gluon distributions contribute to the and drell - yan ratios as higher - order effects . therefore , they should be determined more accurately in the nlo analysis than the lo one . such tendencies are found in fig . because the nlo uncertainties are smaller than the lo ones in both carbon and lead . however , these nlo improvements are not as clear as the cases of polarized pdf and fragmentation functions . it is because the -dependent data are not accurate enough to probe such higher - order effects as discussed in sec . . in order to fix the gluon distributions , accurate measurements are needed for the scaling violation of . the gluon distributions should be also probed by production processes of such as charged hadrons , heavy flavor , , low - mass dilepton , and direct photon . there is a recent study on the gluon shadowing from the hera diffraction data . nuclear gluon distributions play an important role in discussing properties of quark - hadron matters in heavy - ion reactions , so that they need to be determined experimentally . = 100 gev.,width=302 ] we also show the nuclear modifications at =100 gev for the calcium in fig . . the nuclear modifications are not very different from those at =1 gev for the valence - quark distributions . however , the shadowing corrections become smaller in the antiquark and gluon distributions in comparison with the ones at =1 gev , and the modifications tend to increase at medium and large . the distribution functions themselves and their uncertainties are shown in figs . and for the calcium and lead , respectively . both lo and nlo distributions are shown . here , the uncertainties from the nucleonic pdfs are not included in the uncertainty bands . the calcium is an isoscalar nucleus , so that and are equal to and . however , they are different in the lead nucleus because of the neutron excess . in order to see nuclear modification effects , we show the distributions without the nuclear modifications . for example , the distribution is shown in the figure of by using the mrst distributions for and . although the uncertainties are large in the antiquark and gluon distributions at medium and large , they are not very conspicuous in figs . and because the distributions themselves are small . = 1 gev . no modification \" indicates , for example , the distribution in the figure of .,width=275 ] = 1 gev . no modification \" indicates , for example , the distribution in the figure of .,width=275 ] , is shown for the proton , lithium , aluminum , iron , and lead at =1 gev . in the isoscalar nuclei , the distributions vanish .,width=226 ] the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions are assumed in this analysis as they are defined in eq .  . from this definition , it is obvious that and are equal in isoscalar nuclei such as carbon and calcium . in fig . , the ratio is shown for the proton ( p ) , lithium ( li ) , aluminum ( al ) , iron ( fe ) , and lead ( pb ) at =1 gev . because the nuclear corrections are assumed to be equal for the antiquark distributions at in eq .  , they are almost independent of nuclear species except for the isoscalar nuclei . it is interesting to investigate possible nuclear modifications on the distribution at the future facilities . there are noticeable differences between our nlo analysis results and the ones in ref . especially in the strange - quark and gluon modifications . these differences come from various sources . first , the analyzed experimental data sets are slightly different . second , the strange - quark distributions are created by the dglap evolution by assuming at the initial scale , and the charm distributions are neglected in ref . these differences lead to the discrepancies of the gluon modifications . the determined npdfs and their uncertainties can be calculated by using our code , which is supplied on our web site . by providing a kinematical condition for and and also a nuclear species , one can calculate the npdfs . it is explained in appendix . if one needs analytical expressions of the npdfs at the initial scale , one may read instructions in appendix . nuclear densities are usually independent of the mass number , which indicates that the average nucleon separation is constant in nuclei . however , the deuteron is a special nucleus in the sense that its radius is about 4 fm , which is much larger than the average nucleon separation in ordinary nuclei ( fm ) . because it is a dilute system , nuclear modifications are often neglected . in fact , corrections to nucleonic structure functions and pdfs are small , namely within a few percentages according to theoretical estimates even if they are taken into account . c@c@c @c reference & ( gev ) & & modification ( % ) + & 4 & 0.015 & 1.1 + & 4 & 0.010 & 2.5 + & 4 & 0.010 & 2.0 + & 4 & 0.010 & 0.4.8 + & 4 & 0.010 & 1 ( 3.5 ) + theoretical modifications in the deuteron depend much on models . the shadowing of ref . , which was used in the mrst analysis , is 1.1% at =0.015 and =4 gev ; however , other model calculations are different , 0.5.5% at as shown in table . furthermore , the modifications at medium could be as large as or larger than the small- shadowing ( for example , 5% at according to ref . ) . such deuteron corrections are becoming important recently although the magnitude itself may not be large . for example , precise nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for investigating quark - hadron matters in heavy - ion collisions such as deuteron - gold reactions in comparison with deuteron - deuteron ones at rhic . they are also valuable for discussing gottfried - sum - rule violation and flavor - asymmetric antiquark distributions because deuteron targets are used . in our previous versions on the npdfs , the data of are not included in the used data set . obtained nuclear modifications tend to be large in comparison with the theoretical model estimations . for example , the hkn04 analysis indicates about 6 and 8% corrections in antiquark and gluon distributions , respectively , at small  with =1 gev and about 5% in valence - quark ones at medium  . they are possibly overestimations in the sense that typical theoretical models have corrections within the order of a few percentages . in order to obtain reasonable deuteron modifications from experimental data , we added measurements into the data set in our analysis . these deuteron data were already included in the analysis results in sec . . in addition to the analysis of sec . , two other analyses have been made by modifying eq .  : an additional factor is introduced . the analysis results in sec . correspond to the =1 case . the other analyses have been made by taking =0 and by taking it as a free parameter . we call them analyses 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively : * analysis 1 : =1 , * analysis 2 : =0 , * analysis 3 : =free parameter . the values of these analyses are listed in table . c@c@c @c@c nucleus & # of data &  &  & ( free ) + d / p & 290 & 322.5 & 282.6 & 284.9 + & 606 & 709.3 & 704.8 & 703.8 + & 293 & 369.0 & 381.6 & 375.3 + drell -

meson - dominance mechanism and the shadowing in the deuteron is about 1% at according to this model . if this shadowing is not a realistic correction , the nucleonic pdfs of the mrst should partially contain nuclear effects at small . the medium- and large- regions are not corrected , so that some deuteron effects could be also included in the nucleonic pdfs in these regions . however , the corrections are not experimentally obvious in such regions as we find in the actual data of fig . . in this way , the nucleonic pdfs could contain some deuteron modification effects . third , the nuclear effects could be absorbed into the asymmetry because it is determined partially by the data . these are the possible reasons why analysis 2 produces the smaller value . . the solid , dotted , and dashed curves indicate the nlo results of the analyses 1  , 2  , and 3 ( =free ) , respectively . the shaded bands indicate uncertainties of the analysis-3 curves.,width=302 ] in the third analysis , the additional parameter is determined from the global analysis . as mentioned , the internucleon separation is exceptionally large in the deuteron . it leads to small nuclear corrections , which are much smaller than a smooth -dependent functional form , as calculated in various models in table . these models could be used for estimating an appropriate value for . however , we try to determine the nuclear pdfs without relying on specific theoretical models . the modification parameter is determined from the experimental data , and our analysis 3 indicates . if the diffuse deuteron system is considered , the 70% reduction may make sense . nonetheless , it should be noted that this factor may not reflect a realistic modification because it is likely that the deuteron effects are contained in the nucleonic pdfs . we show actual comparisons with the experimental data for by the nmc in fig . . three global analysis results are shown , and the shaded areas indicate uncertainty bands in analysis 3 . the figure suggests that all the analyses are successful in explaining the data . however , as indicated in the reductions in the analyses 2 and 3 , it is clear that their curves are closer to the experimental data at small such as =0.005 and 0.008 . there is a tendency that deviations from the data become larger as the deuteron modifications are increased . all the analysis results are more or less similar in the medium- and large- regions . all the curves of the analysis 1  and 2  are within the uncertainty bands of the analysis 3 ( =free ) , although the analysis-1 curves are at the edges of the error bands at small . it means that all these analysis are consistent with each other and they explain the experimental data . = 1 gev . the solid and dashed curves are obtained by analyses 1 and 3 , respectively , and their uncertainties are shown by the shaded bands.,width=302 ] modifications of the pdfs are shown for the deuteron in fig . at =1 gev . the results of analyses 1 and 3 are shown with their uncertainty estimation . there is no deuteron modification in analysis 2 as obvious from the definition in eq .  . the uncertainty bands of analysis 3 shrink at the points , where the nuclear modifications vanish  , for example , in the figure of the valence - quark modification . this is caused by the error from the parameter . its contributions to the uncertainties are large and the derivative is proportional to , which vanishes at the same points as the function in eq .  . it leads to the gourd - shaped uncertainty band in because other terms are small . such an error shape does not appear in analysis 1 because the error term of does not exist . here , the derivative is also a cubic polynomial and vanishes at three points . however , and are quadratic functions , which do not vanish at the same points , and their contributions to the uncertainties are of the same order of the and terms . this is the reason why such a gourd - shaped function does not appear in the uncertainties of the analysis . the antiquark shadowing is about 2% at and the valence - quark modification is about 1% in the analysis 1 according to fig . . we should note that the antiquark shadowing is reduced about 30% at =4 gev as shown in fig . in comparing it with the theoretical values in table . in analysis 3 , the antiquark shadowing becomes 0.5% , which could be slightly smaller than the theoretical ones . both corrections ( 2% and 0.5% ) are slightly different from the assumed correction ( 1% at =0.01 and =4 gev ) in the mrst fit . the uncertainty bands depend on the initial functional form or assignment of the parameters in the analysis . the uncertainties are generally larger in analysis 3 , and the line of is within the bands . it suggests that precise deuteron modifications can not be determined at this stage . the modifications in fig . may not be seriously taken because the deuteron effects could be partially included in the nucleonic pdfs . it is difficult to judge what the realistic deuteron modifications are at this stage . actual modifications are possibly in between these analysis results . in order to obtain realistic modifications , the nucleonic pdfs should be determined by considering the deuteron modifications , for example , of our analysis results . then , using new nucleonic pdfs , we redetermine our nuclear pdfs including the ones in the deuteron . realistic deuteron modifications should be obtained by repeating this step . nuclear pdfs have been determined by the global analyses of experimental data for the ratios of the structure functions and drell - yan cross sections . the uncertainties of the determined npdfs are estimated by the hessian method . the first important point is that the uncertainties were obtained in both lo and nlo so that we can discuss the nlo improvement on the determination . we found slight nlo improvements for the antiquark and gluon distributions at small  ; however , they are not significant at larger . accurate experimental measurements , especially on the dependence at small , should be useful for determining higher - order effects such as the nuclear gluon distributions . the valence - quark distributions are well determined . the antiquark distributions are also determined at ; however , they have large uncertainties at . the gluon modifications are not precisely determined in the whole region . future measurements are needed to determine accurate nuclear distributions . nuclear modifications were discussed for the deuteron in comparison with the experimental data of . however , it is difficult to find accurate modifications at this stage because deuteron effects could be partially contained in the nucleonic pdfs . an appropriate nucleonic pdf analysis is needed in addition to accurate measurements on the ratio . our npdfs and their uncertainties can be calculated by using the codes in ref . . m.h . and s.k . were supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research from the japanese ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology . was supported by japan society for the promotion of science . the determined parameters are listed in table . there are other parameters , , , and , which are automatically calculated from the tabulated values by the conservation conditions of nuclear charge , baryon number , and momentum in eq .  . because they depend on nuclear species , namely on and , their calculation method is explained in the following . the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions in eq .  are used in this analysis , whereas the flavor symmetric ones are used in the previous versions in refs . , so that relations are slightly different from the ones in appendix of ref . one can obtain values of these parameters for any nuclei by calculating the following integrals : , \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! & \\nonumber \\\\ i 8 & = \\int dx {(1-x)^{\\beta g } } g(x ) , & \\ ] ] where and is here , the parameters , , , and depend on according to eq .  . it is noteworthy that the integrals , , and depend on . using these integrals , one obtains parameter values by the conservations in eq .  : . \\ ] ] from these values together with the parameters in table and the nucleonic pdfs at =1 gev of the mrst parametrization , one obtains the npdfs at =1 gev for a given nucleus . if distributions are needed at different , one needs to evolve the npdfs by using own evolution code . if one does not have such an evolution code , one had better use the code in appendix b. numerical values of the npdfs can be obtained for given , , and . in particular , if one is interested in estimating the uncertainties of the npdfs , this practical code needs to be used . codes for calculating nuclear pdfs and their uncertainties can be obtained from the web site . a general guideline for usage is explained in appendix b of ref . , and the conditions are the same in the current version , hkn07 ( hirai , kumano , nagai in 2007 ) . therefore , the details should be found in ref . the npdfs can be calculated for nuclei at given and , for which the kinematical ranges should be in and 1 gev gev . input parameters for running the code are explained in the beginning of the file npdf07.f . a sample program , sample.f , is supplied as an example for calculating the nuclear pdfs and uncertainties . the uncertainties of the npdfs are estimated by using the hessian matrix and grid data for derivatives with respect to the parameters . the usage is explained in the sample program . j. adams et al . lett . * 97 * , 152302 ( 2006 ) ; b. a. cole et al . , hep -

{"article": "let be an oriented surface of finite type , i.e. is a closed surface of genus from which points , so - called punctures , have been deleted . we assume that , i.e. that is not a sphere

of all hyperbolic metrics on under the action of the group of diffeomorphisms of which are isotopic to the identity . the smooth fibre bundle over of all holomorphic quadratic differentials of area one can naturally be viewed as the unit cotangent bundle of for the teichmller metric . the teichmller geodesic flow on commutes with the action of the mapping class group of all isotopy classes of

similarly , define the strong stable manifold to be the set of all quadratic differentials whose horizontal measured geodesic lamination coincides with the horizontal measured geodesic lamination of .

i.e. exponential decay of correlations for hlder observables holds . the proof of this result uses the fact , independently due to athreya , that the teichmller flow is exponentially recurrent to some fixed compact set , i.e. there is a compact set and a number such that for all \\}<e^{-ct}/c ] such that for all . we show . every -invariant compact subset of is a topological hyperbolic set for .

measures depend continuously on in the weak-topology . this means that for every bounded function the function is continuous . the curve graph is a hyperbolic geodesic metric space and hence it admits a gromov boundary . for there is a complete distance function on of uniformly bounded diameter and there is a number such that for all . for define a distance on by clearly depends continuously on , moreover the metrics are equivariant with respect to the action of on and . let be the set of all hyperbolic structures whose systole is at least . let be the canonical projection and denote by the collection of all quadratic differentials whose orbit under the teichmller flow projects to a teichmller geodesic entirely contained in . by theorem 2.1 of and lemma , there is a constant only depending on such that for every the curve is a -quasi - geodesic in , i.e. we have for define a distance function on as follows . recall that the gromov boundary of can be identified with the set of all ( unmeasured ) minimal geodesic laminations on which fill up , i.e. which decompose into topological discs and once punctured topological discs . if then the horizontal measured geodesic lamination of is uniquely ergodic , i.e. it admits a unique transverse measure up to scale , and its support is minimal and fills up . moreover , the -quasi - geodesic converges in to . in particular , for every there is a natural injection , and this map is continuous ( compare the discussion of the topology on in ) . its image is a locally compact subset of . for , a chain from to is a finite collection . for such a chain , write and let note that by the properties of the distance functions the function is a distance function on which does not depend on . locally near , the map is uniformly bilipschitz with respect to and the distance function on . the resulting family of metrics on the intersection with of strong unstable manifolds is invariant under the action of the mapping class group . moreover , it is continuous in the following sense . if and if then . similary we obtain a continuous -invariant family of distance functions on the intersections with of the strong stable manifolds . since for every the assignment is a -quasi - geodesic in where only depends on , we obtain from hyperbolicity of , the definition of the metrics , lemma 3.2 and inequality  above the existence of numbers only depending on such that the flow satisfies the following contraction property . 1 . for all . for all . now the assignment which associates to a quadratic differential its horizontal and its vertical measured foliation is continuous and therefore for every there is an open neighborhood of in , an open neighborhood of in , an open neighborhood of in , a number and a homeomorphism which associates to a quadratic differential the triple . here equals the quadratic differential in and is such that , and equals the quadratic differential in . the homeomorphism then defines a box metric on by let be the canonical projection ; the map is open . the projection of to is compact . choose a finite covering of by open sets which are images under of open subset of the above form . for every let be the box metric on and define a distance on by . let be a partition of unity for this covering and define a distance on by . the distance function has the properties required in the definition of a topological hyperbolic set . the proposition now follows from the fact that for and that contains every compact -invariant subset of . in this section we use train tracks to construct a subshift of finite type which we use in the following sections to study the teichmller geodesic flow . define a numbered complete train track to be a complete train track together with a numbering of the branches of . since a mapping class which preserves a train track as well as each of its branches is the identity ( compare the proof of lemma 3.3 of ) , the mapping class group acts freely on the set of all isotopy classes of numbered complete train tracks on . if a complete train track is obtained from by a single shift , then a numbering of the branches of induces a numbering of the branches of in such a way that the branch with number is large ( or mixed or small ) in if and only if this is the case for the branch with number in . define the numbered class of a numbered train track to consist of all numbered train tracks which can be obtained from by a sequence of numbered shifts . the mapping class group naturally acts on the set of all numbered classes . we have . the action of on the set of numbered classes is free . let be a numbered complete train track and let be such that is contained in the numbered class of . we have to show that is the identity . for this note that since can be obtained from by a sequence of numbered shifts , there is a natural bijection between the complementary components of and the complementary components of . these complementary components are trigons , i.e. topological discs with three sides of class which meet at the cusps of the component , and once punctured monogons , i.e. once punctured discs with a single side whose endpoints meet at the cusp of the component . thus if is not the identity then with respect to the natural identification of complementary components , induces a nontrivial permutation of the complementary components of . now for each fixed complementary component of , the train track can be modified with a sequence of shifts to a train track with the property that the boundary of the complementary component of corresponding to consists entirely of small and large branches . but this just means that the complementary component is determined by the small and large branches in its boundary . since is contained in the numbered class of , the map preserves the large and the small branches of and hence it maps to itself . this implies that is the identity and shows the lemma . define a numbered combinatorial type to be an orbit of a numbered class under the action of the mapping class group . thus by definition , the set of numbered combinatorial types equals the quotient of the set of numbered classes under the action of the mapping class group . let be the set of all numbered combinatorial types . if the numbered combinatorial type defined by a numbered train track is contained in a subset of , then we say that is contained in and we write . if the complete train track can be obtained from a complete train track by a single split , then a numbering of the branches of naturally induces a numbering of the branches of and therefore such a numbering defines a numbered split . in particular , we can define a split of a numbered class to be a numbered class with the property that there are representatives of such that can be obtained from by a single numbered split in this sense . if is obtained from by a single split at a large branch with number then a large branch in is large in as well . thus we can define a full split of a numbered class to be a numbered class with the property that there are representatives of such that can be obtained from by splitting at each large branch once . numbered splitting and shifting sequence is a sequence of numbered complete train tracks such that for each , the numbered train track can be obtained from a shift of by a single numbered split . similarly , a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence is a sequence of numbered complete train tracks such that for each , the numbered train track can be obtained from a shift of by a single full numbered split . we say that a numbered combinatorial type is splittable to a numbered combinatorial type if there is a numbered train track which can be connected to a numbered train track by a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence . recall from the definition of a train track in standard form for some framing ( or marking in the terminology of masur and minsky ) of our surface . each such train track is complete . twist connector in a train track to be an embedded closed trainpath of length consisting of a large branch and a small branch . we call a train track to be in special standard form if it satisfies the following properties . 1 . every large branch of is contained in a twist connector . the union of all twist connectors in is the pants decomposition of our framing . carries a complete geodesic lamination whose minimal components are the pants curves of and such that every pair of pants of our decomposition contain precisely three leaves of spiraling about mutually distinct pairs of boundary curves of the pair of pants . we have . there is a set of numbered combinatorial types with the following properties . 1 . for all , is splittable to . if is contained in and if is any full numbered splitting and shifting sequence issuing from then is contained in for all . 3 . for every train track in special standard form for some framing of there is a numbering of the branches of such that the resulting numbered train track is contained in . let be any numbered train track in special standard form for some framing of and let be the set of numbered combinatorial types of all complete train tracks which can be obtained from by a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence . by construction , the set has property ( 2 ) in the lemma . let be any numbered train track which contains a twist connector consisting of a large branch and a small branch . then the train track obtained from by a split at with as a winner is contained in the numbered class which is obtained from by exchanging the numbers of and . this means the following . let be the large branches of different from and assume that the numbered train track is obtained from by one split at each large branch . then there is a numbered combinatorial type obtained from the numbered combinatorial type of by a full numbered split and which is obtained from the type of by a permutation of the numbering . let and let be a numbered train track representing . it follows from the considerations in that there is a numbered splitting sequence connecting to a numbered train track which can be obtained from a point in the -orbit of by a sequence of shifts and by a permutation of the numbering . our above consideration shows that can also be connected with a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence to a numbered train track which can be obtained from a point in the -orbit of by a permutation of the numbering . since the collection of all permutations of the numbering of obtained in this way clearly forms a group , the train track can be connected to a train track of the same numbered combinatorial type as by a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence . thus has the first property stated in the lemma . the third property follows from in exactly the same way . let be the cardinality of a set as in lemma and number the elements of in an arbitrary order . we identify each element of with its number . define if the numbered combinatorial type can be split with a single full numbered split to the numbered combinatorial type and define otherwise . the matrix defines a subshift of finite type . the phase space of this shift is the set of biinfinite sequences with the property that if and only if for all . every biinfinite full numbered splitting and shifting sequence contained in defines a point in . vice versa , since by lemma the action of on the set of numbered classes of train tracks is free , a point in determines an -orbit of biinfinite full numbered splitting and shifting sequences which is unique up to replacing the train tracks in the sequence by shift equivalent train tracks . we say that such a numbered splitting and shifting sequence realizes . the shift map acts on . for write ; the shift is topologically transitive if for all there is some such that . namely , if we define a finite sequence of points to be admissible if for all then equals the number of all admissible sequences of length connecting to . the following observation is immediate from the definitions . the shift is topologically transitive . let be arbitrary . by lemma , there is a nontrivial finite full numbered splitting and shifting sequence connecting a train track of numbered combinatorial type to a train track of numbered combinatorial type . this splitting and shifting sequence then defines an admissible sequence connecting to . the subshift of finite type defined by the matrix is topologically mixing if there is some such that for all . the next simple lemma will imply that the shift defined by numbered splitting and shifting sequences as above is topologically mixing . let be a topologically transitive subshift of finite type for the finite alphabet and with transition matrix . if there are such that then is topologically mixing . let be a topologically transitive subshift of finite type as in the lemma with -transition matrix and such that for some we have . assume to the contrary that is not topologically mixing . following , there is then a number and there is a partition of the set into disjoint subsets such that for we have only if . let be as above and let be such that where indices are taken modulo . from our assumption we conclude that , on the other hand it follows from that also . in other words , mod and therefore which contradicts our assumption that the shift is not topologically mixing . this shows the lemma . the subshift of finite type defined by the set of numbered combinatorial types of complete numbered train tracks on is topologically mixing . by lemma , it is enough to find some numbered combinatorial types such that our transition matrix satisfies . however , such numbered combinatorial types of train tracks are shown in figure c below . namely , the train tracks and are numbered shift equivalent , and the same is true for the train tracks and . to complete the proof of the corollary , simply observe that any large branch in a complete train track incident on a switch with the property that at least one of the branches of which is incident on and small at is not a small branch defines a configuration as in figure c. in particular , every large branch of a train track in special standard form for some framing of is contained in such a configuration ( see , h06a ) . in this section we relate the subshift of finite type constructed in section 4 to the extended teichmller flow . as in section 2 , for denote by the convex cone of all transverse measures on . recall that coincides with the space of all measured geodesic laminations which are carried by . in particular , if is shift equivalent to then we have . the projectivization of can naturally be identified with the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations which are carried by . then is a compact subset of the compact space of all projective measured geodesic laminations on . if is any numbered splitting and shifting sequence then and hence is well defined and non - empty . thus by the considerations in section 4 , every sequence determines an orbit of the action of on the space of compact subsets of . we call the sequence uniquely ergodic if consists of a single uniquely ergodic point , whose support fills up and admits a unique transverse measure up to scale . let be the set of all uniquely ergodic sequences . we define a function as follows . for choose a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes . by the definition of a uniquely ergodic sequence there is a distinguished uniquely ergodic measured geodesic lamination which is carried by each of the train tracks and such that the maximal weight disposed by this measured geodesic lamination on a large branch of equals one . note that if is shift equivalent to then the maximal weight that disposes on a large branch of equals one as well , i.e. this normalization only depends on the numbered class of . define by the requirement that the maximal mass that the measured geodesic lamination disposes on a large branch of equals one . by equivariance under the action of the mapping class group , the number only depends on the sequence . in other words , is a function defined on . we have . the function is continuous . let and let . by the definition of the topology on our shift space it suffices to show that there is some such that whenever is such that for . for this let be a numbered full splitting and shifting sequence which realizes . then defines a measured geodesic lamination which is carried by and such that the maximal weight which is disposed by on any large branch of equals one . by definition , equals the logarithm of the maximal weight which is disposed by on a large branch of . now the space of all transverse measures for equipped with the topology as a family of weights on the branches of coincides with a closed subset of the set of all measured geodesic laminations equipped with the weak topology . thus there is a neighborhood of in the space of all measured geodesic laminations such that for every the logarithm of the maximal weight of a large branch of defined by is contained in the interval and that the logarithm of the maximal weight that disposes on a large branch of is contained in the interval . on the other hand , for every the set of all measured geodesic laminations which are carried by is a closed cone in containing and we have for and . as a consequence , there is some such that . this implies that the value of on the intersection with of the cylinder for is contained in which shows the lemma . the next lemma gives additional information on the function . 1 . the function is nonnegative and uniformly bounded from above . 2 . there is a number such that for every we have 3 . if the support of a measured geodesic lamination defined by is maximal then . we have to show that there is a number such that for every . to show the first inequality , choose a numbered full splitting and shifting sequence which realizes . we assume that is obtained from by a single split at each large branch of . using the above notations , let be the uniquely ergodic measured geodesic lamination defined by . then is carried by each of the train tracks , and the maximal weight of a large branch of for the transverse measure on defined by equals one . if is the transverse measure on defined by the measured geodesic lamination then for every large branch of we have where are the neighbors of the diagonal of our split in which are the images of the losing branches of the split under the natural identification of the branches of with the branches of . moreover , we have for every branch of and the corresponding branch of , and the measure is nonnegative . in particular , the -weight of any branch of does not exceed the -weight of the corresponding branch of . since for every transverse measure on a complete train track the maximum of the -weights of the branches of is assumed on a large branch we conclude that our function is non - negative . let be the large branches in with and let be the branches of which are incident on the endpoints of and which are winners of the split . let moreover be the losing branches of the split chosen in such a way that the branch is incident on the same endpoint of as . denote by the branches in corresponding to . if there is a large branch in of weight one with respect to the measure then necessarily this branch is among the branches , so assume that is such a branch . then the -weight of the branch vanishes and hence if the support of the measured geodesic lamination is maximal . this shows the third part of our lemma . if is any uniquely ergodic measured geodesic lamination which fills up then the subtrack of of all branches of positive -weight is large , i.e. its complementary components are all topological discs or once punctured topological discs . a branch of with is contained in the interior of a complementary component of which contains both branches in its boundary . by the considerations in , the number of consecutive splits of of this form at a large branch contained in the side of a complementary region of is bounded from above by the number of branches contained in this side . this just means that there is a universal number such that and complete the proof of the second part of our lemma . on the other hand , by the switch condition for transverse measures on a train track , the maximum of the -weights of the two winning branches of a split of at a large branch is not smaller than half the -weight of . since the maximum of the weight of a transverse measure on a complete train track is assumed on a large branch , our function is uniformly bounded . this completes the proof of the lemma . following we call a finite admissible sequence tight if for one ( and hence every ) numbered splitting and shifting sequence realizing the natural carrying map maps every branch of onto . by the definition of , by lemma and by the considerations in section 5 of , tight finite admissible sequences exist . call a biinfinite sequence normal if every finite admissible sequence occurs in infinitely often in forward and backward direction . the next lemma follows from the considerations in . for this we define a measured geodesic lamination on to be recurrent if for one ( and hence every ) teichmller geodesic defined by a quadratic differential with horizontal lamination there is a compact subset of moduli space with the property that the intersection of the projection of to moduli space with the compact is unbounded . by the results of masur , a recurrent lamination is uniquely ergodic and its support fills up . we have . let be normal and let be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes ; then consists of a single recurrent projective measured geodesic lamination . let be normal and let be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence defined by and the choice of a numbered train track of numbered combinatorial type . then for every there is a natural projective linear map . following , this map can be described as follows . let be the number of branches of a complete train track on . if the train track is obtained from by a single split at a large branch then every measured geodesic lamination which is carried by defines both a transverse measure on and a transverse measure on . if are the losers of the split connecting to and if is the diagonal branch of the split , then we have , i.e. the convex cone of transverse measures on is mapped to the convex cone of transverse measures on by the product of two elementary -matrices . for a column vector write . viewing a measure in the cone as a point in we denote by the intersection of with the sphere . the set can be identified with the projectivization of and is homeomorphic to a closed ball in . for all the projective linear map can naturally be identified with the map ( see ) . the jacobian of this map is bounded from above by one at every point of . following the reasoning in , it is enough to show that there is a number and there are infinitely many such that for each of the transformations which is given by products of elementary -matrices , every column vector is added to every other column vector at least once . namely , in this case the jacobians of the projectivizations of the maps are bounded from above by a number which is independent of . then the jacobians of the projectivized transformations tend to zero as uniformly on . moreover , the maps are uniformly quasiconformal and therefore their pointwise dilatations tend to zero as well ( see ) . in particular , the intersection consists of a single point . moreover , for every the point is contained in the interior of the convex polyhedron and hence the transverse measure defined by on is positive on every branch of ( compare the beautiful argument in ) . now for every tight admissible sequence and for every numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes , the transformation has the above property . as a consequence , if is normal and if is a splitting and shifting sequence which realizes then consists of a single point . since contains with every every projective measured geodesic lamination with the same support , the projective measured geodesic lamination is necessarily uniquely ergodic . we are left with showing that it also fills up . for this call a geodesic lamination complete if is maximal and if moreover can be approximated in the hausdorff topology by simple closed geodesics . the space of complete geodesic laminations carried by is a compact non - empty subset of the compact space of all complete geodesic laminations on ( compare ) and consequently is non - empty . every projective measured geodesic lamination whose support is contained in a lamination from the set is contained in . since the intersection consists of the unique point , the laminations from the set contain a single minimal component which is the support of . if does not fill up then there is a simple closed curve on which intersects a complete geodesic lamination in a finite number of points . by the considerations in we can find a sequence of simple closed curves on which approximate in the hausdorff topology such that the intersection numbers are bounded from above by a universal constant . moreover , for every there is some such that the train track carries the curve . as a consequence , there is a splitting and shifting sequence connecting to a train track which contains as a vertex cycle . this means that the transverse measure on defined by a carrying map spans an extreme ray in the convex cone of all transverse measures on . let be the curve graph of and let be any map which associates to a complete train track a vertex cycle of . it was shown in that there is a number such that the image under of every splitting and shifting sequence is an unparametrized -quasi - geodesic in . this means that there is an nondecreasing map such that the assignment is a uniform quasi - geodesic . since the curve graph is hyperbolic and since the distance in between the curves and is uniformly bounded , this implies that the diameter of the image under of the splitting and shifting sequence is finite . however , the sequence is normal by assumption and hence the sequence contains subsequences whose images under the map are unparametrized quasi - geodesics in with endpoints of arbitrarily large distance . this is a contradiction and implies that the support of fills up as claimed . in other words , the set of normal points in is contained in the set of uniquely ergodic points . since normal points are dense in , the same is true for uniquely ergodic points . recall from section 2 that for every the cone of all tangential measures on can be identified with the space of all measured geodesic laminations which hit efficiently . if is obtained from by a single split at a large branch and if is the matrix which describes the transformation then there is a natural transformation given by the transposed matrix . this transformation maps the tangential measure on determined by a measured geodesic lamination hitting efficiently to the tangential measure on defined by the same lamination ( which hits efficiently as well , compare ) . denote by the space of projective measured geodesic laminations which hit efficiently . as in the proof of lemma we observe . let be normal and let be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes ; then consists of a single uniquely ergodic projective measured geodesic lamination which fills up . we call the sequence doubly uniquely ergodic if is uniquely ergodic as defined above and if moreover for one ( and hence every ) numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes the intersection consists of a unique point . by lemma and lemma , every normal sequence is doubly uniquely ergodic and hence the borel set of all doubly uniquely ergodic sequences is dense . moreover , for each such sequence and every numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes there is a unique pair of uniquely ergodic measured geodesic laminations which fill up and which satisfy the following additional requirements . 1 . is carried by each of the train tracks and the total mass disposed by on the large branches of equals one . hits each of the train tracks efficiently . 3 . . in particular , by equivariance under the action of the mapping class group , every sequence determines a quadratic differential of total area one over a point in moduli space . let be the set of all area one quadratic differentials whose horizontal and vertical measure foliations are both uniquely ergodic and fill up . then is a -invariant borel subset of . a suspension for the shift on the subspace of all doubly uniquely ergodic sequences in the phase space with roof function is the space \\mid ( x i)\\in { { }{}}\\}/\\sim ] . recall that a point in teichmller space can be viewed as a ( marked ) hyperbolic metric on and that there is a number only depending on the topological type of our surface such that for every there is a pants decomposition for which consists of pants curves of hyperbolic length at most . rafi showed that for every quadratic differential of area one on the riemann surface corresponding to the -lengths of the pants curves of this short pants decomposition ( i.e. the lengths of the -geodesic representatives ) are bounded from above by a universal constant . for every there is a constant such that if is contained in the -thick part of all marked hyperbolic metrics without closed geodesics of length less than then the hyperbolic metric and the -metric are -bilipschitz equivalent ( compare e.g. for this well known fact ) . however , for points in the thin part of teichmller space there may be curves which are short in the -metric but which are long in the hyperbolic metric . the next lemma gives some information on the curves which become short for the quadratic differential metric along a teichmller geodesic defined by a quadratic differential . for its formulation , recall from the definition of a vertex cycle for a train track . such a vertex cycle is a simple closed curve which is carried by and such that the transverse measure defined by spans an extreme ray in the convex polygon of all transverse measures on . for simplicity , we identify with a subset of our suspension space . we have . let and let be a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes . let and let be a lift of defined by . then there is a vertex cycle on of uniformly bounded -length . let and let be a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes . let be the pair of transverse measured geodesic laminations which are defined by the lift of which is determined by . by construction , the maximal weight that is disposed by on a large branch of is one and hence the total weight of the transverse measure on defined by is uniformly bounded . thus by corollary 2.3 of , the intersection number between and any vertex cycle of is uniformly bounded . by the results of , the number of vertex cycles for a complete train track is uniformly bounded . since the space of transverse measures on is spanned by the vertex cycles , there is a decomposition where and are the vertex cycles of . now the number of vertex cycles is uniformly bounded and hence we have for a universal number and at least one . then the weight that the tangential measure disposes on any branch contained in the image of is bounded from above by . since a vertex cycle runs through every branch of at most twice , the intersection is bounded from above by twice the total weight of the measure on the branches of in the image of . now and hence by our choice of this total weight is uniformly bounded . but this means that is uniformly bounded and shows the lemma . now let be a periodic point for the teichmller geodesic flow . then as is well known and therefore there is some such that the orbit of the suspension flow through is mapped by the semi - conjugacy onto the -orbit of . since our semi - conjugacy is countable - to - one this orbit of the suspension flow need not be closed . however we have . let be a point which is mapped by to a periodic point of the teichmller flow . then the closure of the set is contained in . the lemma is a consequence of a general observation about the piecewise euclidean metric defined by a quadratic differential and its relation to the preimages of in . for this let and let . let be a numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes and let be the lift of defined by . let be the measured geodesic laminations defined by the quadratic differential . then the maximal weight that disposes on a large branch of equals one . by lemma we know that there is a number such that . we claim that there is a constant only depending on such that for a small number , assume that for large . let be the subgraph of of all branches whose weight with respect to the measure defined by is at least . it follows from the considerations in the proof of lemma that carries a simple closed curve . moreover , the -weight of every branch which is incident on a switch in and which is not contained in is close to zero . by the considerations in lemma 2.5 of , this implies that is very small ( depending on ) . now if is the tangential measure on defined by the vertical measured geodesic lamination of then and therefore is uniformly bounded . as a consequence , the -length of is uniformly bounded , and is very small . since the measured geodesic laminations fill up there is a unique point such that is balanced with respect to . this means that the intersection numbers conicide and are not smaller than half of the -length of . in other words , if is small then the minimum over all of the -lengths of is very small . on the other hand , if the orbit of under the teichmller geodesic flow is periodic then for sufficiently small it does not intersect the subset of teichmller space of hyperbolic metrics whose systole is smaller than . but then the -length of any simple closed curve on is uniformly bounded from below independent of . this shows our claim . let be a map which associates to a complete train track on one of its vertex cycles . by our above consideration and the results from , the assignment is an -quasi - geodesic for some depending only on . however , this means that there is a constant such that for each the sequence has the following property . let again be a full numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes . then for each , the distance between and in is at least three . now there are only finitely many full numbered splitting and shifting sequences of length with this property . in particular , by the considerations in the proof of lemma , there is a universal constant with the following property . let be any such sequence and let be any measured geodesic lamination which is carried by and such that the maximal weight disposed by on a large branch of equals one . then the maximal weight disposed by on a large branch of is at least . this then implies that the function is bounded from below on by a positive constant and that moreover the assignment is a uniform quasi - geodesic in . as a consequence , the sequence is contained in a compact subset of . this shows the lemma . masur and veech constructed a probability measure in the lebesgue measure class on the space of area one quadratic differentials over moduli space . this measure is invariant , ergodic and mixing under the teichmller flow , and it gives full measure to the space of quadratic differentials whose horizontal and vertical measured geodesic laminations are uniquely ergodic and fill up . moreover , the measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the strong stable and the unstable foliation . in this section we use the results from section 5 to construct an uncountable family of -invariant probability measures on including the lebesgue measure which give full measure to the set of quadratic differentials with uniquely ergodic horizontal and vertical measured geodesic laminations . these measures are ergodic and mixing , with exponential recurrence to a fixed compact set , and they are absolutely continuous with respect to the strong stable and the unstable foliation . this completes the proof of theorem 1 from the introduction . we begin with an easy observation on -invariant probability measures on . let be a -invariant borel probability measure on . then . since is a -invariant borel subset of it is enough to show that there is no -invariant borel probability measure on with . for this assume to the contrary that such a measure exists . note that can be represented as a countable union of compact sets and hence there is some compact subset of with . now by a result of masur , for every there is a number such that for every . the thus defined function on can be chosen to be measurable . then there is some such that . by invariance of under the teichmller flow we have and therefore which is a contradiction . the lemma follows . recall from section 5 the construction of the semi - conjugacy from our subshift of finite type with roof function onto the -invariant set . since the roof function on is uniformly bounded and essentially positive , every -invariant borel probability measure on which gives full mass to defines a finite invariant measure for the -suspension flow . the image of this measure under the semi - conjugacy is a finite -invariant borel measure on which we may normalize to have total mass one . this means that the map induces a map from the space of -invariant borel probability measures on which give full mass to into the space of -invariant probability measures on . we equip both spaces with the weak-topology . we have . the map is continuous . since is a compact metrizable space , the space of all probability measures on is compact . thus we only have to show that whenever in then . but this just means that for every continuous function on we have which is obvious since is continuous . we also have . the image of is dense . there is a one - to - one correspondence between the space of all locally finite -invariant borel measures on the product which give full measure to the pairs of distinct uniquely ergodic points and the space of all -invariant finite borel measures on . now every closed teichmller geodesic gives rise to such a measure which is a sum of dirac measures supported on the endpoints of all lifts of the teichmller geodesic to teichmller space . here the pair of endpoint is the pair in which consists of the horizontal and the vertical projective measured geodesic lamination of a quadratic differential defining a lift of the closed teichmller geodesic to teichmller space . since the pairs of endpoints of teichmller geodesics are known to be dense in the set of -invariant borel probability measures which can be approximated by weighted point masses on closed geodesics is dense in . as a consequence , it is enough to show that every measure which is supported on a single closed geodesic is contained in the image of . to see that this is indeed the case , let be a periodic point for the teichmller flow . up to replacing by its image under the time--map of the flow for some small , we may assume that there is some with . denote as before by the suspension flow defined by the roof function . for define where by abuse of notation we view as a point in . by lemma , the supports of these measures are all contained in a fixed compact subset of , viewed as a subset of . therefore there is a sequence going to infinity such that the measures converge as weakly to a -invariant measure . however , it follows immediately from the discussion in the proof of lemma that the support of is contained in the preimage of the closed orbit under the map . then is a borel probability measure on which is supported on the -orbit of . this shows the lemma . let be the cardinality of the set of numbered combinatorial types as in lemma and let be any -matrix with non - negative entries such that if and only if ( where the matrix is defined in the paragraph preceding lemma ) . we require that is stochastic , i.e. that for all . by corollary and the definitions , there is a number such that . thus by the perron frobenius theorem , there is a unique positive probability vector with and such that by our normalization . then the probability vector together with the stochastic matrix defines a markov probability measure for the subshift of finite type which is invariant under the shift and gives full measure to the set of normal points . the -mass of a cylinder equals , and the -mass of is . note that the identity for all is equivalent to invariance of under the shift . since by corollary our shift is topologically mixing , the shift is equivalent to a bernoulli shift ( see p.79 of ) . in particular , it is ergodic and strongly mixing , with exponential decay of correlations , and it gives full measure to the subset of normal points . we call a shift invariant probability measure on of this form a bernoulli measure . the support of every bernoulli measure on is all of , and is invariant and ergodic under the action of the shift . the flow on the borel suspension with roof function constructed in section 4 preserves the borel measure given by where is the lebesgue measure on the flow lines of our flow . since by lemma the roof function on is bounded , the measure is finite and moreover ergodic under the action of the flow . the push - forward of the measure by the semi - conjugacy defined in corollary is a finite -invariant ergodic measure on which gives full mass to the quadratic differentials with uniquely ergodic horizontal and vertical measured geodesic laminations which fill up . we call its normalization to a probability measure on a bernoulli measure for the teichmller geodesic flow . by construction , a bernoulli measure for is absolutely continuous with respect to the strong stable and the unstable foliation . a bernoulli measure for the teichmller geodesic flow is mixing . let be the borel set of all projective measured geodesic laminations on which are uniquely ergodic and whose support fills up and denote by the diagonal in . the set of quadratic differentials in with uniquely ergodic horizontal and vertical measured geodesic lamination which fill up is ( non - canonically ) homeomorphic to by choosing a borel map which associates to a pair of transverse projective measured geodesic laminations in a point on the teichmller geodesic determined by the pair and extending this map in such a way that it commutes with the natural -actions . with this identification , the teichmller geodesic flow acts on via . in particular , there is a natural orbit space projection which is equivariant with respect to the natural action of the mapping class group on and the diagonal action of on . let be a bernoulli measure for the teichmller geodesic flow . then lifts to a -invariant -invariant radon measure on , and this radon measure disintegrates to a radon measure on which is invariant under the diagonal action of and which gives full mass to the invariant subset . since is ergodic under the teichmller geodesic flow , the measure is ergodic under the action of . assume to the contrary that the measure is not mixing . then there is a continuous function on with compact support and so that does not converge weakly to zero as . we follow and conclude that there is a non - constant function which is the almost sure limit of cesaro averages of of the form , i.e. for positive and negative times . replacing by the function for sufficiently small guarantees that there is a subset of full -measure so that the lift to of the resulting function is well defined and continuous on the lines in . the periods of the function define a measurable -invariant map of into the set of closed subgroups of which is constant by ergodicity . since by assumption , the set where this group is of the form for some has full measure . the radon measure on is absolutely continuous with respect to the product foliation of . this means that is locally of the form where is a measure on the space of projective measured geodesic laminations whose measure class is invariant under the action of and where is a positive measurable function . since the action of on is minimal , the measures are of full support . now the horizontal measured geodesic lamination of a typical point for the measure on is uniquely ergodic and fills up and hence if are typical points for on the same strong stable manifold in then for a suitable choice of a distance function on . from continuity of the function and absolute continuity of with respect to the strong stable and the unstable manifolds we deduce that . similarly we argue for the strong unstable manifolds ( see the nice exposition of this argument in ) . as a consequence , there is an -invariant subset of full -mass such that for every and every the function is constant almost everywhere along the strong stable manifold and along the strong unstable manifold . as in we define by absolute continuity , the set has full measure with respect to . choose a density point for and let be small disjoint neighborhoods of in with the property that for every and every the projective measured geodesic laminations together fill up . such neighborhoods are well known to exist . then every pair determines a unique teichmller geodesic . cross ratio function as follows . choose a quadratic differential whose horizontal measured geodesic lamination is in the class and whose vertical measured geodesic lamination is in the class . for , the pair defines a teichmller geodesic whose corresponding one - parameter family of quadratic differentials intersects in a unique point . similarly , the family of quadratic differentials defined by the pair intersects in a unique point , the family of quadratic differentials defined by the pair intersects in a unique point , and finally the family of quadratic differentials defined by intersect in a unique point . the value does not depend on the choice of the quadratic differential defining the pair the resulting function is continuous and satisfies . recall that there is a natural action of the group on where the diagonal subgroup of acts as the teichmller geodesic flow . each -orbit can naturally and equivariantly be identified with the unit tangent bundle of the hyperbolic plane together with its usual action by isometries . in particular , for every the orbit through of the unipotent subgroup of of all upper triangular matrices of trace two is an embedded line in , and the orbit through of the unipotent subgroup of all lower triangular matrices of trace two is contained in . thus the -orbit through the above quadratic differential defines two embedded line segments containing in their interior so that the restriction of the function to coincides with the restriction of the usual dynamical cross ratio on the space of oriented geodesics in the hyperbolic plane . in particular , the restriction of the function to is not constant in no neighborhood of . on the other hand , if we write then are dense in . since our function is continuous and not constant in any neighborhood of we conclude that for every there are points such that . however , by our choice of , the function is constant along the manifolds and and therefore . in other words , the function has arbitrarily small periods which is a contradiction to our assumption that the set of periods of equals for some . this completes the proof of our proposition . we also obtain a control of the return time to a suitably chosen compact subset of for a flow line of the teichmller geodesic flow on which is typical for a bernoulli measure on . the following observation is a version of theorem 2.15 of for all bernoulli measures ( see also ) . there is a compact subset of and for every bernoulli measure for the teichmller geodesic flow there is a number and a constant such that ,\\phi^sq\\not\\in k\\}\\leq ce^{-\\epsilon t}.\\ ] ] let be an admissible sequence with the additional property that there is some such that the sequences and are both tight . by lemma 5.2 of there is a compact subset of such that for every numbered splitting and shifting sequence which realizes the following holds . let be a measured geodesic lamination which is carried by and which defines a transverse measure on for which the sum of the masses of the large branches of equals one . let be a measured geodesic lamination which hits efficiently and such that . then the quadratic differential with horizontal measured geodesic lamination and vertical measured geodesic lamination is contained in the lift of to . let be any bernoulli measure on the shift space . then is exponentially mixing and hence there are constants such that . the corollary now follows from this observation and the fact that the roof function on which defines our borel suspension which is semi - conjugate to the teichmller flow is uniformly bounded . we conclude this section with a description of the -invariant -invariant measure in the lebesgue measure class on the unit cotangent bundle of teichmller space which is invariant under the natural action of the group and which projects to a probability measure on . this measure induces a -invariant radon measure on . using the notations from section 4 , let be the collection of all numbered combinatorial types as in lemma 4.2 . for every choose a numbered train track of combinatorial type . let be the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations which are carried by and let be the space of all projective measured geodesic laminations which hit efficiently . note that are closed disjoint subsets of with dense interior . define a full split of to be a complete train track which can be obtained from by splitting at each large branch precisely once . since splits at different large branches of commute , the numbering of the branches of induces a numbering of the branches of . thus the train tracks obtained from by a full split are numbered . we obtain a decomposition into borel sets where consists of the set of all projective measured geodesic laminations which are carried by  . for the intersection is contained in a hyperplane of ( with respect to the natural piecewise linear structure which defines the lebesgue measure class ) and hence it has vanishing lebesgue measure . if is the combinatorial type of the numbered train track then define and define for . note that we have for all and . by invariance of the measure under the action of the mapping class group , the probabilities only depend on the combinatorial type and the choice of a representative in the shift equivalence class of . consider the random walk on the space of all numbered classes defined by the -invariant transition probabilities . it follows from our above consideration that the exit boundary of this random walk can be viewed as a probability measure on in the lebesgue measure class . by invariance under the action of the mapping class group , the shift invariant measure on the subshift of finite type with alphabet and transition matrix defined by the above full splits is contained in the lebesgue measure class . therefore the measure on defined by the biinfinite random walk with the above transition probabilities coincides with up to scale . we use this observation to obtain a new ( and simpler ) proof of theorem 2.15 of and of the main theorem of . let be the -invariant probability measure on in the lebesgue measure class . there is a

then the length of the curve with respect to the hyperbolic structure is smaller than for . by our choice of , for every there are at most distinct simple closed geodesics of length at most for the hyperbolic metric . however , since for each the length of on the hyperbolic surface equals , the length of on does not exceed . as a consequence , there is some such that the curves and coincide . this contradicts the fact that is pseudo - anosov . the lemma follows . for let be the set of all hyperbolic metrics on up to isometry whose systole is at least , i.e. is the projection of the subset defined in section 3 . by proposition , there is a number such that for every closed geodesic in moduli space of length at most there is a point whose distance to is not bigger than . namely , every can be connected to with a geodesic of length at most where is a universal constant ( see ) . let be the diameter of . for there is a lift of to which passes through a point of distance at most to . let be the pseudo - anosov map preserving which defines . we then have and hence our corollary follows from lemma and proposition . to conclude , we reduce the counting problem for closed geodesics in moduli space to a counting problem for pseudo - anosov elements with small translation length in the curve graph . for this we fix again a point . for every there is a number with the following property . let and let be a closed geodesic in moduli space of length . let be the conjugacy class in defined by . if is such that then . let and let be a closed geodesic in moduli space of length . let be sufficiently small that no two simple closed geodesics with respect to a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume on of length at most can intersect . let be the compact subset of moduli

{"article": "general relativity in spacetime dimension larger than four supports black brane solutions that , unlike in lower dimensions , are not uniquely characterized by their asymptotic charges ( mass , spin , gauge charges ) . an example of this situation is the kaluza - klein black hole , a solution of the einstein equations consisting of a black hole embedded in a compactified spacetime , for instance . because of the lack of uniqueness in , this system exhibits a range of phases , characterized by the horizon topology , as the period of the is varied . for much larger than the horizon length scale , the horizon topology is corresponding to an isolated black hole . as becomes of order one finds uniform and non - uniform black string phases with horizon topology . there is evidence to support the conjecture that uniform string decays proceed via a topology changing phase transition into a black hole final state ( see for reviews ) . other proposals for the final state of the unstable black string can be found in . understanding the dynamics of the black hole / black string phase transition is important for a variety of reasons . apart from being a toy model for studying the physics of topology change in higher dimensional general relativity , it is also relevant for its connection to gauge / gravity duality in string theory . also , the kaluza - klein black hole plays a role in the phenomenology of scenarios where gravity is strong at the tev scale , and production of higher dimensional black holes at the lhc becomes a possibility . there does not exist an analytic solution of the einstein equations describing a black hole in the background with ( however , see ; for , a closed form metric can be found in ref . ) . for generic values of the ratio one must resort to numerical simulations in order to find solutions . these have been carried out in . here , we will consider the asymptotic region of the phase diagram in which the parameter is much less than unity , and analytic solutions can be found perturbatively . although this region of parameter space is likely to be far from where the black hole / black string transition is expected to take place , it is a region that can be mapped out analytically . these perturbative calculations provide a useful test of the numerical simulations , and by extrapolation , may give qualitative information on the full phase diagram of solutions . the corrections to the thermodynamics of a small black hole in the background have been calculated in ref . to leading order for arbitrary , and in ref . to order for . in ref . , the order corrections were calculated by employing a specialized coordinate system for the entire spacetime . alternatively , the approach taken in is to split the spacetime into a region near the black hole where the solution is the -schwarzschild metric , weakly perturbed by compactification , and a far region in which the metric can be parametrized in terms of asymptotic multipole moments ( see ref . for a systematic discussion of this procedure ) . these two solutions are then patched together in an overlap region , yielding a relation between the short distance parameters ( the scale of the -dimensional schwarzschild metric ) and the mass and tension as measured by an observer far from the black hole . this behavior can be traced to the short distance singularities of the -dimensional flat space green s function . a prescription for handling such divergences at leading order in can be found in . ] . as discussed in , all thermodynamic quantities relevant to the phase diagram can be calculated given the asymptotic charges \" . here , we propose a different method for calculating the phase diagram in the perturbative region , based on the effective field theory approach applied to extended gravitational systems developed in . since in the limit there is a large hierarchy between the short distance scale and the compactification size , it is natural to integrate out ultraviolet modes at distances shorter than to obtain an effective lagrangian describing the dynamics of the relevant degrees of freedom at the scale . in the resulting eft , the scale only appears in the wilson coefficients of operators in the action constructed from the relevant modes . ignoring horizon absorption and spin , these long wavelength modes are simply the metric tensor coupled to the black hole worldline coordinate . the couplings of the particle worldline to the metric can be obtained by a fairly straightforward matching calculation , although one expects that all operators consistent with symmetries ( diffeomorphism invariance , worldline reparametrizations ) are present . although clearly there are some similarities between the eft approach and the matched asymptotics of , there are several advantages to formulating the expansion in the language of an eft : * in the eft , it is possible to disentangle the terms in the perturbative expansion that arise from the finite extent of the black hole , which scale like integer powers of , versus post - newtonian \" corrections due to the non - linear terms in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian that scale like integer powers of and are therefore also equivalent to powers of . * the eft has manifest power counting in . this means that it is possible to determine at what order in the expansion effects from the finite size of the black hole horizon first arise . as we will show in the next section , the first finite size correction , which in the eft manifests itself through a non - minimal coupling of the black hole worldline to the riemann tensor arises at order . for a fixed the finite size effects , for example the tidal distortion of the black hole horizon , will contribute to the thermodynamic variables at order relative to the leading order result . thus the finite horizon effects become as large as as . this also indicates that the results of refs . are not sensitive to the specific structure of the kaluza - klein black hole , but rather reflect the thermodynamics of structureless point particles . * in the eft , calculations can be carried out using the standard tools of field theoretic perturbation theory . in particular , the perturbative expansion has a diagrammatic interpretation in terms of standard feynman diagrams . ultraviolet divergences that arise in feynman integrals can be dealt with using a standard regulator ( e.g , dimensional regularization ) and absorbed into the coefficients of local operators . there is no impediment to renormalizing the theory to all orders in . as an example of this procedure we calculate in sec . the corrections to the asymptotic mass and tension of the kaluza - klein black hole . our results are organized as follows . in sec . we formulate the eft and derive the power counting rules for . using this power counting we analyze the relative contribution of an arbitrary finite size worldline operator . in sec . we use the eft to calculate the corrections to the asymptotic charges and for arbitrary and use these results in sec . to work out the corresponding corrections to the thermodynamic relations . in this section we also compare our analytic formulas to the results of numerical simulations for and . we consider an isolated black hole in a background spacetime of the form . coordinates on are denoted by and labels circumference along . coordinates on -dimensional spacetime are denoted . the period of the factor as measured by an observer at is . in order to determine the phase diagram of this system , it is sufficient to calculate the moments of the kaluza - klein black hole that appear in the first non - trivial corrections to the asymptotic metric . by the symmetries of the background , the non - vanishing terms are , to leading order as , the coefficients and are related to the asymptotic mass and tension by the relations , the constant is defined such that the newton potential between two masses in uncompactified -dimensional space is . in the limit , these quantities can be calculated in perturbation theory . one method is to solve the einstein equations perturbatively , using the matched asymptotic techniques of . another possibility is to first integrate out the black hole , replacing the spacetime in the vicinity of the horizon with an effective lagrangian for the black hole worldline coupled to gravity . including all terms with up to two derivatives ( we will be more specific about the expansion parameter in this expansion below ) this lagrangian takes the form -m 0\\int ds + c e\\int ds e {\\alpha\\beta } e^{\\alpha\\beta } + c b\\int ds b {\\alpha 1\\cdots\\alpha {d-2 } } b^{\\alpha 1\\cdots\\alpha {d-2 } } + \\cdots.\\ ] ] here , as in any other eft , we have simply written down all terms compatible with diffeomorphism invariance and worldline reparametrization invariance . in this equation , and the tensors , and are the electric and magnetic components of the riemann tensor . note that if the black hole is in a ricci flat background then operators involving the ricci tensor can be removed by field redefinitions of the metric . in this case the components of are sufficient to specify the riemann tensor . all coefficients of operators in eq .  scale like powers of and , given by in a way that we can be fixed by matching to the full schwarzschild solution ( see below ) . starting from eq .  , we use the background field method to calculate and . we decompose the metric tensor into a long wavelength non - dynamical background field and a short wavelength graviton field and do the path integral over , holding the black hole worldline to some fixed value , = \\int { \\cal d } h {\\alpha\\beta } \\exp i \\left(s + s {gf}\\right),\\ ] ] where is a suitable gauge fixing term . it is convenient to choose to be compatible with background field diffeomorphisms , for example with . to calculate eq .  it is sufficient to linearize about flat space , and to take . the relation between and can be read off the linear terms in ] , and is the kaluza - klein representation of the propagator on flat . the solid lines denote the black hole worldline . there are no propagators associated with such lines . an external line denotes an insertion of a factor of . finally , the vertices are constructed from the -graviton terms in the expansion of eq .  about flat space . diagrams that become disconnected by the removal of the particle worldline do not contribute to the terms in ] that scales like ( denotes a time ordered vev in the free graviton theory ) , so that by eq .  it gives a contribution to that is suppressed by a single power of relative to the leading order result . likewise , the vertex in the gravitational action is so that fig . (a ) scales like . in general , a given diagram scales as , where and , the latter bound saturated by diagrams containing no internal graviton loops . in order to power count the worldline operators with more derivatives , we first need to fix the dependence of the coefficients on and . this is done by matching the effective lagrangian of eq .  to the full black hole theory , described by the schwarzschild metric of eq .  . as in any other eft , the matching procedure consists of adjusting the couplings in the effective lagrangian so that observables calculated in the eft agree with those of the full theory . a convenient observable to match to is the -matrix element for low energy elastic graviton scattering off the black hole geometry . in the full theory , this is obtained by solving the linearized wave equation for the graviton field in the schwarzschild metric . after separation of variables this boils down to solving a radial equation that generalizes the regge - wheeler equation describing perturbations of four - dimensional schwarzschild black holes to -dimensions . the explicit form of this equation can be found in ( see also ) . since the only scale in the full theory is we expect the amplitude to take the form where is the energy of the incident graviton , are spin labels , is the scattering angle and is a calculable function . in the eft , the scattering cross section receives contributions from insertions of all the couplings in eq .  . in particular , the two - derivative operators give rise to terms in the amplitude that go like ,\\ ] ] where are functions whose specific form is not important for our purposes here . thus are non - zero only if has a term in the low energy limit that scales like . if this is the case then we find that . after expanding about flat space , we have for , , the first contribution to the tadpoles in $ ] due to an insertion of is from the diagram in fig . . according to our power counting rules implying that the thermodynamics is not sensitive to the structure of the black hole until order , which for is one order beyond the second order results of and becomes as . more generally , a worldline operator with derivatives and factors of the graviton scales like and it gives a contribution to the charges and that is order  . as an application of the eft method , we now compute the corrections to the quantities that govern the thermodynamics of the kaluza - klein black hole . according to the power counting rules established in the previous section , the relevant diagrams are those of fig . and fig . finite size effects do not come in at this order . the first corrections to the mass and tension of the system arise from the two diagrams in fig . the diagram in fig .

(a ) , fig . (c ) , and fig . (e ) do not contribute . it is straightforward to derive the feynman rules necessary to calculate the diagrams of fig . we will simply write down the results of evaluating each diagram . for the tadpoles in the effective action , one finds that evaluating the diagrams at zero external momentum gives rise to no new integrals : the integration over the internal momenta factorizes into the square of the integrals of the previous section . the results are for the tadpole terms , we find from fig . (b ) the contribution of graphs fig . (d ) , fig .

{"article": "the mauritius radio telescope ( mrt ) is a fourier synthesis , t - shaped non - coplanar array operating at 151.5 mhz . the telescope was built to fill the gap in the availability of deep sky surveys at low radio frequencies in the southern hemisphere . the aim of the survey with mrt is to contribute to the database of southern sky sources in the declination  range to , covering the entire right ascension  , with a synthesised beam of and an expected point source sensitivity ( 1- ) of mjy beam . the zenith angle is given by , where , is the latitude of mrt . mrt has been designed to be the southern - sky equivalent of the cambridge 6c survey at 151.5 mhz . the next generation radio telescopes , like the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , that are being built are low frequency arrays ; clearly indicating a renewed interest in metre - wavelength astronomy . the key astrophysical science drivers include acceleration , turbulence and propagation in the galactic interstellar medium , exploring the high redshift universe and transient phenomenon , as well as searching for the redshifted signature of neutral hydrogen from the cosmologically important epoch of reionisation ( eor ) . the surveys made using such arrays will provide critical information about foregrounds which will also provide a useful database for both extragalactic and galactic sources . mrt survey at 151.5 mhz is a step in that direction and , in addition , will provide the crucial sky model for calibration . imaging at mrt is presently done only on the meridian to minimise the problems of non - coplanarity . a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) image in - coordinates is formed by stacking one - dimensional ( 1-d ) images on the meridian at different sidereal times . images of a steradian of the southern sky , with an rms noise in images of mjy beam ( 1- ) , were produced by . a suite of programs developed in - house was used to reduce hours of the survey data ( a quarter of the total hours observed over a span of years ) . the deconvolved images and a source catalogue of sources were published by . systematics in positional errors were found when the positions of sources common to mrt catalogue and the molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ) were compared . treated the systematics in errors in and independently . by estimating two separate 1-d least - squares fits for errors in and the systematics were corrected only in the source catalogue . however , errors remained in the images which impede usefulness of mrt images for multi - wavelength analysis of sources . in addition , the source of errors was not investigated . at mrt , the visibility data is processed through several complex stages of data reduction specific to the array , especially , arising due to its non - coplanarity . it was therefore decided to correct for errors in the image domain and avoid re - processing the visibility data . this paper describes the application of 2-d homography , a technique ubiquitous in the computer vision and graphics community , to correct the errors in the image domain . homography is used to estimate a transformation matrix ( which includes rotation , translation and non - isotropic scaling ) that accounts for positional errors in the linearly gridded 2-d images . in our view , this technique will be of relevance to the new generation radio telescopes where , owing to huge data rates , only images after a certain integration would be recorded as opposed to raw visibilities . this paper also describes our investigations tracing the positional errors to errors in the array geometry used for imaging . our hypothesis on the array geometry , its subsequent confirmation endorsed by re - estimation of the array geometry and its effect on the images are also described . the rest of the paper is organised as follows . section compares positions of sources common to mrt catalogue and mrc . the 2-d homography estimation is briefly described in section . section presents the correction scheme and typical results . the re - estimation of mrt array geometry is described in section . finally , we summarise and present our conclusions in section . the positions of sources common to mrt catalogue and mrc were compared . we used mrc because of its overlap with mrt survey , its proximity in frequency compared to other reliable catalogues available and , comparable resolution . moreover , for sources of listed flux density jy ( at 408 mhz ) the catalogue is reported to be substantially complete and , the reliability is reported to be 99.9% . for our further discussions , errors in mrc source positions are considered random , without any systematics . about 400 bright sources common to the two catalogues and with flux density at 151.5 mhz greater than 5 jy ( - ) were identified and their positions were compared . the sources were labelled as common if they lie within of each other . since mrc has a source density of source deg , the chances of considering two unrelated sources as common are extremely low . a flux threshold of 15- ensures a source population abundant to reliably estimate homography ( explained in next section ) . the positional errors in and show no systematics as a function of ( refer first rows of fig . a and b ) . for visualisation , the errors are shown in percentages of mrt beamwidths . the errors in and show a linear gradient as a function of . the errors in , plotted against , reach of the mrt beamwidth ( refer second row of fig . a ) . whereas , the errors in , plotted against , are significant and reach of mrt beamwidth . ( refer second row of fig . b ) . histograms in fig . c and fig . d show the distribution of errors in and , respectively . the histogram of errors in shows a broader spread compared to errors in . re - imaging , to correct for errors in the images , would involve re - reducing the hours of observed data . owing to the complexity involved it was decided to correct for the positional errors in the images , thus avoiding re - processing . the 2-d homography estimation technique was employed for correcting positional errors in images and is discussed in detail in the following section . the 2-d planar homography is a non - singular linear relationship between points on planes . given two sets of corresponding image points in projective coordinates , , homography maps to the corresponding . where , . the homography sought here is a non - singular matrix such that : = \\left \\left . \\ ] ] where , and represent of corresponding mrt and mrc sources , respectively . in equation , and are referred to as the homogeneous coordinates and are always represented one dimension higher than the dimension of the problem space . this is a commonly used representation in computer graphics . the simple reason is that with a matrix one can only rotate a set of 2-d points around the origin and scale them towards or away from the origin . a matrix is incapable of translating a set of 2-d points . the homogeneous coordinates allow one to express a translation as a multiplication . a single matrix , with homogeneous coordinates , can account for rotation , scaling and translation of 2-d coordinates . for example , from equation , . notice , ( representing translation in -dimension ) is simply being added to the normal dot product that together represents rotation and scaling . in homogeneous coordinates , the 2-d problem space is a plane hovering in the third dimension at a unit distance . a general homography matrix , for projective transformation , has 8 degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) . for our system , both errors in and have only -dependency . therefore , a less general , 2-d affine transformation is sufficient . a 2-d affine transformation ( two rotations , two translations and two scalings ) requires 6-dof , therefore in , and are zero . since each 2-d point provides two independent equations , a minimum of 3 point correspondences are necessary to constrain in the affine space . a set of such equation pairs , contributed by point correspondences , form an over - determined linear system : \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] ^{t} \\ ] ] ^{t}.\\ ] ] in equation , represents transpose of a matrix . this system can be solved by least squares - based estimators . at this stage it is useful to consider the effect of using -coordinates to represent the brightness distribution on the celestial sphere . ideally , it is the directional cosines , with respect to the coordinates of the array , which represent the spherical coordinates in the sky . therefore , the image coordinates in which homography should in principle be estimated are . however , at mrt , for 1-d imaging on the meridian : therefore , is a natural choice for one of the coordinates and is indeed used in the present case . on the meridian , the directional cosine is zero . for small errors , , in , i.e. close to the meridian : here , is the error in . equation shows that an error in will lead to an error in with a -dependence . the 2-d images of mrt are 1-d images on the meridian made at different sidereal times and stacked . therefore , positional errors both in and do not show systematics as a function of ( first rows of figs . a and b ) . we preferred -representation because all mrt images were already generated in this coordinate system . this choice compelled us to seek solutions for errors in as a function of rather than . we plotted errors in against both and and obtained separate linear least - squares fits . the rms of residuals in both fits is of the beamwidth in . however , the rms of difference between the fitting functions and in the range of mrt is only of the beamwidth in . therefore , the random errors in the source positions are larger than the errors introduced by the preferred -coordinates for and . in and , the ranges from 18 hours to 24 hours and the ranges from to ( corresponding to the declination range of to ) . moreover , in matrix ( refer equation ) there are entries of 1 s & 0 s . such a matrix is ill - conditioned and in the presence of noise in the source positions , the solution for an over - determined system may diverge from the correct estimate . the effect of an ill - conditioned matrix is that it amplifies the divergence . a normalisation ( or pre - conditioning ) is therefore required . to obtain a good estimate of the transformation matrix we adopted the normalisation scheme proposed by . the normalisation ensures freedom on arbitrary choices of scale and coordinate origin , leading to algebraic minimisation in a fixed canonical frame . the homography matrix is estimated from normalised coordinates by the least - squares method using singular value decomposition ( svd ) . the matrix is then denormalised to obtain . the scheme is briefly described below : 1 . * normalisation of : * compute a transformation matrix , consisting of a translation and scaling , that takes points to a new set of points such that the centroid of the points is the coordinate origin , and their average distance from the origin is . * normalisation of : * compute a similar transformation matrix , transforming points to . * estimate homography : * estimate the homography matrix from the normalised correspondences using the algorithm described earlier in the main section . * denormalisation : * the final homography matrix is given by : shows the block schematic of the correction scheme . at mrt , the full declination range for each sidereal hour range is divided into 4 zones ( refer second row in fig . a or b ) . each zone is imaged with different delay settings to keep the bandwidth decorrelation to . therefore , the 6 sidereal hours of images under consideration , have 24 images  . using the population of common sources , there are four possible alternatives to correct mrt images by computing : 1 . 24 homography matrices - one for each image . 2 . 6 matrices - one for each sidereal hour . 3 . 4 matrices - one for each declination zone . 4 . a single homography matrix for the entire steradian . in principle , bright sources in each image  can be used to independently estimate a homography matrix . our earlier experiments to correct each image independently showed that the homography matrices were similar . the plots of errors in and plotted against and ( refer to fig . a and b ) indicate that the errors are independent of the four delay zones and the range of . this implies that estimating a single homography matrix for the entire source population should suffice in representing the errors . the homography matrix estimated using common sources ( described in section ) is : . \\ ] ] in the estimated homography matrix , indicates there is no correction required in as a function of . indicates mrt images should be corrected in with a dependence . the estimated correction is up to of the beam in , at the extreme ends of the range . similarly , indicates that there is no correction required in , as a function of . however , indicates that mrt images should be compressed in by a factor of 0.9990 ( which is part in 1000 ) . the values of and indicate that the zero cross - overs of errors in both and plotted against are close to the of the calibration source ( mrc1932 - 464 ) used for imaging . using equation , the homography matrix is used to project each pixel from the images to a new position , effectively correcting for positional errors in images . shows positional errors in after homography - based correction . a comparison of these plots with fig . demonstrate that homography has removed the systematics and the residual errors are within 10% of the beamwidth for sources above 15- , as expected . a and fig . b show scatter plots of errors in against errors in before and after correction , respectively . for visualisation , the errors are represented in percentages of respective mrt beamwidths . notice , after correction ( refer fig . b ) the scatter is almost circular as opposed to elliptical before correction ( refer fig . a ) . the rms before correction is of the beamwidth . after correction , the rms is reduced to of the beamwidth and , the systematic errors have been removed . a and b show mrt contours before and after correction , respectively , overlaid on sumss ( sydney university molonglo sky survey ) image , for a source around . the corrected mrt image contours in fig . b overlap with the source in sumss image . c and d show similar comparison for a source around . notice fig . d , since the errors around are within 10% of the beamwidth , the contours in both figs . c and d show a good overlap as expected and homography has not applied perceivable correction to images at this declination . we have overlaid mrt contours on a number of extended sources at 843 mhz reported by . shows a typical overlay of mrt contours on sumss image of a region around the cluster abell 3667 . the overlay is perceivably satisfactory . the 2-d homography corrected the positional errors in the image domain . for imaging the remaining steradians of mrt survey , hours of data has to be reduced . ideally , for imaging the new regions , one would like to trace the source of these errors and correct them in the visibilities . in the following section we discuss how we traced the source of errors and corrected them in the visibility domain . this section describes our expansion - compression hypothesis for the source of errors in our images . the subsequent corrections we estimated and applied to eliminate the errors are also described . for meridian transit imaging , . the brightness distribution in the sky as a function of and the complex visibilities measured for different values of the north - south ( ns ) baseline vector component form a fourier pair . a scaling error of in will result in a scaling factor of in the -component of the baseline vector . by positional error analysis it is clear that mrt images are stretched ( expanded ) in declination , i.e. , note , for images the 2-d homography estimated a correction ( compression ) factor , , of 0.9990 . this cued to the hypothesis that we have compressed the north - south baseline vectors . equation b means , a baseline distance of m in the ns arm was wrongly measured as m ( 1 part in 1000 ) . similarly , a -dependent correction in cued to possible -component in the east - west ( ew ) baseline vectors . next , we describe the re - estimation of array geometry . we begin with a brief description of the mode of observations with mrt . mrt has 32 fixed antennas in the ew arm and 15 movable antenna trolleys in the ns arm . for measuring visibilities , the 15 ns trolleys are configured by spreading them over 84 m with an inter - trolley spacing of 6 m ( to avoid shadowing of one trolley by another ) . mrt measures different fourier components of the brightness distribution of the sky in 63 different configurations ( referred to as allocations ) to sample ns baselines every 1 m . therefore , effectively , there are 945 antenna positions ( 63 allocations * 15 antennas / allocation ) in the ns arm and a total of 30,240 ( 945 * 32 ) visibilities are used for imaging . a small error in a measuring scale of relatively shorter length is likely to build up systematically while establishing the geometry of longer baselines . this effect would be observed in the instrumental phases estimated using different calibrators . in principle , the instrumental phases estimated using two calibrators at different declinations , for a given baseline , should be the same , allowing for temporal variations in the instrumental gains . a non - zero difference in these estimates may be due to positional errors of the baseline or positions of calibrators . as mentioned earlier , our analysis of positional error in sources and the homography matrix cued to positional errors in baselines ( or antenna positions ) . the simple principle of astrometry was used to estimate errors in antenna positions and is discussed below . the observed visibility phase , , in a baseline with components , due to calibrator with direction cosines , is given by : where , represents true instrumental phases , represents ew antennas and represents ns antennas . for meridian transit imaging equation becomes : the instrumental phases , , estimated using the measured geometry are given by : here , and are errors in the assumed baseline vectors . are phases of complex baseline gains obtained in the process of calibration . equation has three unknowns . to reduce the number of unknowns , one can eliminate the true instrumental phases by taking a difference between the instrumental phases estimated using two calibrators . this difference gives : } \\nonumber \\\\ + \\delta w^{} {ij } \\left . } \\ ] ] note , the -components of the baseline vectors are short and non - cumulative measurements . therefore , in principle , one can consider as zero - mean random errors with no systematics . equation in that case can be written as : . \\ ] ] describing the system in terms of errors in antenna positions , as opposed to errors in baseline positions , equation becomes : . \\ ] ] this equation is also not sufficient to solve for errors in the antenna positions as we have two unknowns and one equation . we set up another equation using a third calibrator source , , spaced away in declination from and : . \\ ] ] the equations and are a linear set of equations for one baseline . for the measurements in 63 allocations , the set of equations can be formulated in a matrix form and solved by svd - based least - squares estimator : where , the measurement vector is to be determined . here , . the measurement vector gives and estimates for 32 ew and 945 ns antenna locations , respectively . observation vector consists of two sub - matrices , and , formed using the left - hand - side of equations and , respectively . here , , i.e. , the total number of visibilities measured for imaging . therefore , . the data matrix . each row in the data matrix has only two non - zero elements , corresponding to a baseline formed by one ew and one ns antenna , making it very sparse . the observation vector is constructed from the gain tables of the array obtained using calibrators mrc0407 - 658  , mrc0915 - 118  and mrc1932 - 464  . the sensitivity per baseline at mrt is jy for a 1 mhz bandwidth and an integration time of one second . it takes minutes of time for sources at to transit a 2 primary beamwidth of elements in the east - west array . this leads to a sensitivity per baseline ( including the non - uniform weighting due to primary beam ) of jy . the flux density of these three calibrators as seen by mrt is jy ; strong to get reliable calibration . further , the calibrators are unresolved and isolated from confusing sources and have well known measured positions . a plot of typical phase differences obtained using the pair of calibrators is shown in fig . . fig . a shows the estimated errors in 945 ns antenna positions . the errors show a gradient of 1 part in 1000 along the ns arm . this matches with the linear gradients in the phase differences estimated from the calibrators . the estimates in fig . b show alignment errors of the 32 antennas in the ew arm along the ns - direction . the fit shows a gradient of about 2 part in 10,000 . this indicates that the ew arm is mis - aligned from the true ew - direction . at one extreme end ( 1 km from the centre of the array ) of the ew arm the error is m , equivalent to an angular distance of from the centre of the array . this is the source of a small -dependent error in that was observed in both positional error analysis and the homography matrix . further , our simulation of the synthesised beam in with old ew antenna positions and the corrected ew antenna positions indeed confirm this -dependent error in . using the new antenna positions we have re - imaged one hour from the steradian and have also imaged a completely new steradian . we find no systematics in positional errors thus endorsing our re - estimated array geometry . the homography - based correction was able to correct for systematics in positional errors in the image domain and the errors are within 10% of the beamwidth for sources above 15- . the corrected images of one steradian are available for download at http://www.rri.res.in / surveys / mrt . positional error analysis showed that uncorrected mrt images are stretched in declination by part in 1000 . this translates to a compression of the ns baseline vector , in the visibility domain . the analysis also showed a -dependent error in . this cued towards possible errors in our estimation of the array geometry . by formulating a linear system , using instrumental phases estimated from three well separated calibrators whose positions are well known , the array geometry was re - estimated . the estimated error in the -component of the ns baseline vectors is about 1 mm / m . in other words , the error is about half a wavelength at 150 mhz ( 1 m ) for a 1 km baseline . the estimates also show a small ( 2 part in 10,000 ) -component in the purely ew baseline vectors . this indicates that the ew arm is mis - aligned and inclined at an angle of , to the true ew direction . these estimates match with the observed stretching of mrt images shown by both the positional error analysis and the homography matrix . using the new antenna positions we have re - imaged one hour from the steradian and have also imaged a completely new steradian . we find no systematics in positional errors . this endorses our re - estimated array geometry . re - imaging one steradian starting from visibilities would have been a very time consuming exercise . development of 2-d homography - based correction enabled us to correct for the positional errors in the image domain . in our view , this new technique will be of relevance to the new generation radio telescopes where , owing to huge data rates , only images after a certain integration would be recorded as opposed to raw visibilities . soobash daiboo acknowledges a phd bursary from the south african square kilometer array project . the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for the constructive comments and suggestions", "summary": "a steradian of the southern sky has been imaged at 151.5 mhz using the mauritius radio telescope ( mrt ) . these images show systematics in positional errors of sources when compared to source positions in the molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ) . we have applied two - dimensional homography to correct for systematic positional errors in the image domain and thereby avoid re - processing the visibility data . positions of bright ( above 15- ) point sources , common to mrt catalogue and mrc , are used to set up an over - determined system to solve for the homography matrix . after correction the errors are found to be within 10% of the beamwidth for these bright sources and the systematics are eliminated from the images . this technique will be of relevance to the new generation radio telescopes where , owing to huge data rates , only images after a certain integration would be recorded as opposed to raw visibilities . it is also interesting to note how our investigations cued to possible errors in the array geometry . the analysis of positional errors of sources showed that mrt images are stretched in declination by part in 1000 . this translates to a compression of the baseline scale in the visibility domain . the array geometry was re -

{"article": "the properties of the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model of the nucleus have inspired the idea of superscaling . in the rfg model , the responses of the system to an external perturbation are related to a universal function of a properly defined scaling variable which depends upon the energy and the momentum transferred to the system . the adjective universal means that the scaling function is independent on the momentum transfer , this is called scaling of first kind , and it is also independent on the number of nucleons , and this is indicated as scaling of second kind . the scaling function can be defined in such a way to result independent also on the specific type of external one - body operator . this feature is usually called scaling of zeroth - kind . one has superscaling when the three kinds of scaling are verified . this happens in the rfg model . the theoretical hypothesis of superscaling can be empirically tested by extracting response functions from the experimental cross sections and by studying their scaling behaviors . inclusive electron scattering data in the quasi - elastic region have been analyzed in this way . the main result of these studies is that the longitudinal responses show superscaling behavior . the situation for the transverse responses is much more complicated . the presence of superscaling features in the data is relevant not only by itself , but also because this property can be used to make predictions . in effect , from a specific set of longitudinal response data , an empirical scaling function has been extracted , and has been used to obtain neutrino - nucleus cross sections in the quasi - elastic region . we observe that the empirical scaling function is quite different from that predicted by the rfg model . this indicates the presence of physics effects not included in the rfg model , but still conserving the scaling properties . we have investigated the superscaling behavior of some of these effects . they are : the finite size of the system , its collective excitations , the meson exchange currents ( mec ) and the final state interactions ( fsi ) . the inclusion of these effects produce scaling functions rather similar to the empirical one . our theoretical universal scaling functions , , and the empirical one , have been used to predict electron and neutrino cross sections . the definitions of the scaling variables and functions , have been presented in a number of papers therefore we do not repeat them here . the basic quantities calculated in our work are the electromagnetic , and the weak , nuclear response functions . we have studied their scaling properties by direct numerical comparison ( for a detailed analysis see ref . ) . we present in fig . the experimental longitudinal and transverse scaling function data for the c , ca and fe nuclei given in ref . for three values of the momentum transfer . we observe that the functions scale better than the ones . the scaling functions of c , especially for the lower values , are remarkably different from those of ca and fe . the observation of the figure , indicates that the scaling of first kind , independence on the momentum transfer , and of zeroth kind , independence on the external probe , are not so well fulfilled by the experimental functions . these observations are in agreement with those of refs . . , and transverse , , scaling functions obtained from the experimental electromagnetic responses of ref . . the numbers in the panels indicate the values of the momentum transfer in mev / c . the full circles refer to c , the white squares to ca , and the white triangles to fe . the thin black line in the panel at 570 mev / c , is the empirical scaling function obtained from a fit to the data . the thick lines show the results of our calculations when all the effects beyond the rfg model have been considered . the full lines have been calculated for c , the dotted lines for o , and the dashed lines for ca . the dashed thin lines show the rfg scaling functions.,height=604 ] to quantify the quality of the scaling between a set of scaling functions , each of them known on a grid of values of the scaling variable , we define the two indexes : \\ , -

exchange currents . we have studied the effects of the nuclear finite size , by calculating scaling functions within a continuum shell model . at q=700 mev / c , these scaling functions are very similar to those of the rfg model . at lower values of the momentum transfer , the shell model scaling functions show sharp peaks , produced by the shell structure , not present in the rfg model . we found that shell model scaling functions fulfill the scaling of first kind , the most likely violated , down to 400 mev / c . we have estimated the effects of the collective excitations by doing continuum rpa calculations with two different residual interactions . the rpa effects become smaller the larger is the value of the momentum transfer . at 600 mev / c , the rpa effects are negligible if calculated with a finite - range interaction . collective excitations breaks scaling properties , but we found that scaling of first kind is satisfied down to about 500 mev / c . the presence of the mec violates the scaling of the transverse responses . we included the mec by using the model of ref . . in our calculations only one - pion exchange diagrams are considered , including those with virtual excitation of the . in our model mec effects start to be relevant for 600 mev / c . we found that mec do not destroy scaling in the kinematic range of our interest . the main modification of the shell model scaling functions , are produced by the fsi , we have considered by using the model developed in ref . we obtained scaling functions very different from those predicted by the rfg model , and rather similar to the empirical ones . in any case , the fsi do not heavily break the scaling properties . we found that the scaling of first kind is conserved down to =450 mev / c . the same type of scaling analysis applied to reaction leads to very similar results . to investigate the prediction power of the superscaling hypothesis , we compared responses , and cross sections , calculated by using rpa , fsi and eventually mec , with those obtained by using and . we show in fig . double differential electron scattering cross sections calculated with complete model ( full ) and those obtained with ( dashed lines ) and ( dotted lines ) . these results are compared with the data of refs . . c data have been measured at a scattering angle of =37.5 , the o data at =32.0 and the ca data at =45.5 . the full lines show the results of our complete calculations . the cross sections obtained by using are shown by the dashed lines , and those obtained with by the dotted lines.,height=566 ] the excellent agreement between the results of the full calculations and those obtained by using , indicates the validity of the scaling approach in this kinematic region where the values are larger than 500 mev / c . the differences with the cross sections obtained by using the empirical scaling functions , reflect the differences between the various scaling functions shown in fig . . the disagreement with the experimental data is probably due to the fact that our models do not consider the excitation of the real resonance , and the pion production mechanism . o . in all the panels the full lines show the result of our complete calculation , the dashed ( dotted ) lines the result obtained with our universal ( empirical ) scaling function . the results shown in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) have been obtained for neutrino energy of 300 mev . panel ( a ) : double differential cross sections calculated for the scattering angle of 30 as a function of the nuclear excitation energy . panel ( b ) : cross sections integrated on the scattering angle , always as a function of the nuclear excitation energy . panel ( c ) : cross sections integrated on the nuclear excitation energy , as a function of the scattering angle . panel ( d ) : total cross sections , as a function of the neutrino energy.,height=566 ] the situation for the double differential cross sections is well controlled , since all the kinematic variables , beam energy , scattering angle , energy of the detected lepton , are precisely defined , and consequently also energy and momentum transferred to the target nucleus . this situation changes for the total cross sections which are of major interest for the neutrino physics . the total cross sections are only function of the energy of the incoming lepton , therefore they consider all the scattering angles and of the possible values of the energy and momentum transferred to the nucleus , with the only limitation of the global energy , and momentum , conservations . this means that , in the total cross sections , kinematic situations where the scaling is valid and also where it is not valid are both present . we show in the first three panels of fig . various differential charge - exchange cross sections obtained for 300 mev neutrinos on o target . in the panel ( a ) we show the double differential cross sections calculated for a scattering angle of 30 , as a function of the nuclear excitation energy . the values of the momentum transfer vary from about 150 to 200 mev / c . this is not the quasi - elastic regime where the scaling is supposed to hold , and this explains the large differences between the various cross sections . the cross sections integrated on the scattering angle are shown as a function of the nuclear excitation energy in the panel ( b ) of the figure , while the cross sections integrated on the excitation energy as a function of the scattering angle are shown in the panel ( c ) . the first three panels of the figure illustrate in different manner the same physics issue . the calculation with the scaling functions fails in reproducing the results of the full calculation in the region of low energy and momentum transfer , where surface and collective effects are important . this is shown in panel ( b ) by the bad agreement between the three curves in the lower energy region , and in panel ( c ) at low values of the scattering angle , where the valued are minimal . total charge - exchange neutrino cross sections are shown in panel ( d ) as a function of the neutrino energy . the scaling predictions for neutrino energies up to 200 mev are unreliable . these total cross sections are dominated by the giant resonances , and more generally by collective nuclear excitation . we have seen that these effects strongly violate the scaling . at = 200 mev the cross section obtained with our universal function is still about 20% larger than those obtained with the full calculation . this difference becomes smaller with increasing energy and is about the 7% at = 300 mev . this is an indication that the relative weight of the non scaling kinematic regions becomes smaller with the increasing neutrino energy .", "summary": "superscaling analysis of electroweak nuclear response functions is done for momentum transfer values from 300 to 700 mev / c . some effects , absent in the relativistic fermi gas model , where the superscaling holds by construction , are considered . from the responses calculated for the c , o and ca nuclei , we have extracted a theoretical universal superscaling function similar to that obtained from the experimental responses . theoretical and empirical universal scaling functions have been used to calculate electron and neutrino cross sections . these cross sections have been compared with those obtained with a complete calculation and , for the electron scattering case , with the experimental data ."}
{"article": "one of the oldest problems of algebra is the equation solvability problem over a given algebraic structure . nowadays , many such classical problems arise in a new perspective , namely to consider their computational complexity . in this paper we investigate the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite groups and rings . the equation solvability problem over a finite group asks whether or not two group expressions ( i.e. products of variables and elements of ) can attain the same value for some substitution over . in other words , for the equation solvability problem , one needs to find if there exists at least one substitution satisfying the equation . another interesting problem is whether or not all substitutions satisfy the equation . the equivalence problem over a finite group asks whether or not two group expressions and are equivalent over ( denoted by ) , that is whether or not and determine the same function over . first burris and lawrence investigated the complexity of the equivalence problem over finite groups . they proved that if a group is nilpotent or , the dihedral group for odd , then the equivalence problem for has polynomial time complexity . they conjectured that the equivalence problem for is in polynomial time if is solvable , and conp - complete otherwise . horvth and szab confirmed the conjecture for , where and are abelian groups such that the exponent of is squarefree and . later horvth generalized this result to semidirect products , where and are abelian groups ( here denotes the centralizer of in ) . horvth , lawrence , mrai and szab proved the conp - complete part of the conjecture . but the complexity of the equivalence problem over many solvable , not nilpotent groups is not determined , yet . three of the smallest groups , for which this complexity is not known , are , and a non - commutative group of order . see for a more comprehensive list . even less is known about the equation solvability problem . goldmann and russel proved that if is nilpotent then the equation solvability problem over is solvable in polynomial time , while if is not solvable , then the equation solvability problem is np - complete . little is known for solvable , not nilpotent groups . horvth proved in ( * ? ? ? * corollary 2 ) that the equation solvability problem over is solvable in polynomial time for certain groups , where or or and is commutative . note that all results for both the equivalence and the equation solvability problem over solvable , not nilpotent groups are about groups , where is abelian . one of the groups of small order , for which the equation solvability problem is unknown , is the group . here , denotes the noncommutative group of upper unitriangular matrices over . horvth explicitly asks in ( * ? ? ? * problem 4 ) the complexity of the equivalence and equation solvability problems over this group . the group is isomorphic to a special subgroup of the upper triangular matrices over . motivated by the definition of pattern groups from , we call a group a semipattern group , if is a subgroup of the group of upper unitriangular matrices , and is a subgroup of the diagonal matrices . we give the precise definition of semipattern groups in section . the main result of the paper is the following . the equation solvability problem over semipattern groups is solvable in polynomial time . the group defined in ( * ? ? ? * problem 4 ) is in fact a semipattern group , thus theorem answers horvth s question completely . further , from theorem the equivalence problem over semipattern groups is solvable in polynomial time , as well . indeed , it is known that for a group if the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time , then the equivalence problem is solvable in polynomial time , as well . in the proof of theorem we reduce the solvability of the input equation over a matrix group over a finite field to the solvability of a system of equations over the same field . then we apply some results over finite rings . therefore , we summarize the known results over rings . the equation solvability problem over a finite ring asks whether or not two polynomials can attain the same value for some substitution over . the equivalence problem over a finite ring asks whether or not two polynomials are equivalent over i.e. if they determine the same function over . the complexity of these questions was completely characterized in the past two decades . hunt and stearnes investigated the equivalence problem for finite commutative rings . later burris and lawrence generalized their result to non - commutative rings . they proved that the equivalence problem for is solvable in polynomial time if is nilpotent , and is conp - complete otherwise . the proof of burris and lawrence reduces the satisfiability ( sat ) problem to the equivalence problem by using long products of sums of variables . nevertheless , if we expand this polynomial into a sum of monomials then the length of the new polynomial may become exponential in the length of the original polynomial . such a change in the length suggests that the complexity of the equivalence problem might be different if the input polynomials are restricted to be written as sums of monomials . this motivated lawrence and willard to introduce the sigma equivalence and sigma equation solvability problems , where the input polynomials are given as sums of monomials . lawrence and willard conjectured that if the factor by the jacobson radical is commutative then the sigma equivalence problem is solvable in polynomial time , and is conp - complete otherwise . szab and vrtesi proved the conp - complete part of the conjecture in . horvth confirmed the conjecture for commutative rings in . the polynomial part of this conjecture is completely proved in the manuscript . most of the results for the equation solvability problem follow from the corresponding result for the equivalence problem . in particular , from the argument of szab and vrtesi follows that if the factor by the jacobson radical is not commutative then the sigma equation solvability problem is np - complete . horvth , lawrence and willard proved that if this factor is commutative then the sigma equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time . thus , the sigma equation solvability problem is completely characterized . for the general equation solvability , arguments of burris and lawrence from yield that if the ring is not nilpotent then the problem is np - complete . horvth in proved that the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time otherwise . if is a finite , nilpotent ring then the equation solvability problem over is solvable in polynomial time . horvth uses ramsey s theorem in the proof of theorem . he defines a number that depends only on the ring . then he proves that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting into all but -many variables . thus one can decide whether or not is solvable over in time . however , this number is huge in the size of the ring . in fact , is greater than , where the height of the tower in the exponent is the nilpotency class of . horvth specifically asks in ( * ? ? * problem 3 ) whether or not this number can be decreased . in the second half of the paper we give a new proof of theorem . our algorithm is much more efficient than horvth s . wilson characterizes nilpotent rings with the help of special kind of nilpotent matrix rings . we can decide the equation solvability problem over these special matrix rings similarly as we do over semipattern groups in theorem . in particular , we show that over a nilpotent ring we can decide in time whether or not is solvable , thus providing a partial answer to problem 3 in , as well . we mention that in a completely independent way , krolyi and szab also found a way to decrease the exponent in . in section we summarize the notations , definitions and theorems , that we use in the paper . in particular , in section we review the definition of pattern groups , then we define semipattern groups . in section we discuss the generalization of the equation solvability problem over rings for systems of equations . we are going to apply these results in order to prove theorems and . in section we lay the groundwork for the proof of theorem . in section we prove theorem . we use ideas of this proof in section , where we prove theorem . let denote the finite field of elements . let us consider the group of upper triangular matrices , that is those matrices whose elements under the diagonal are zero and the elements in the diagonal are non - zero : here the group operation is the matrix multiplication . let the identity matrix denoted by . let denote the matrix whose elements are all zero except for the element in the row , which is 1 . let . let thus , contains all those upper triangular matrices , where every element in the diagonal is , and every element whose position is not occurring in p has to be . if is a subgroup of , then we call a pattern group . for more details on pattern groups , see e.g. . let be subgroups of and let be the set of matrices over whose element in the diagonal is from : if is a pattern group then is a subgroup of . then we call a semipattern group and we denote such a group by . further , we note that and . the group defined in ( * ? ? ? * problem 4 ) is in fact a semipattern group : let be a commutative , unital ring , be subsets of . for nonnegative integers , let , , , be pairwise disjoint sets of variables . we say that is solvable over for substitutions from ( and write is solvable over ) if there exist , , , such that the two polynomials attain the same value on this substitution : for proving theorem , we will directly apply the following result of horvth . let be a finite field . let be subgroups of . let ] be polynomials , written as sums of monomials . then it can be decided whether the system of equations is solvable over in time . the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite nilpotent rings is known . horvth proved that the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time . we give a new algorithm in section that is much more efficient than horvth s . in this part we show that we can characterize the complexity of the equation solvability problem over nilpotent rings using the sigma equation solvability problem over special kind of nilpotent matrix rings . hence we can apply the same ideas that we used in the proof of theorem . horvth proved theorem using ramsey s theory . he defined a number that depends only on the ring . then he proved that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting into all but -many variables . thus one can decide whether or not is solvable over in time . but the number is huge in the size of the ring . let be the characteristic of and be the nilpotency class of . let furthermore . then is greater than , where the height of the tower in the exponent is . we give a new proof of theorem in section . our algorithm is much more efficient than horvth s . we prove that time is enough . first , we show that we can handle the equation solvability problem over nilpotent rings using the sigma equation solvability problem over special kind of nilpotent matrix rings . if is a nilpotent ring then the complexity of the general equation solvability problem over is the same as the complexity of the sigma equation solvability over . indeed , we can rewrite every polynomial over as a sum of monomials in time , where is the nilpotency class of . now , . hence , at the cost of an extra factor in the exponent , we may assume that every input polynomial is given as a sum of monomials . furthermore it is enough to consider the equation solvability problem over nilpotent rings with prime power characteristic , because every ring is a direct sum of rings of prime power characteristic , and the equation solvability problem can be handled componentwise . wilson characterizes finite nilpotent rings with prime power characteristic . let be a finite nilpotent ring with characteristic , and let have an independent generating set consisting of generators over . then is a homomorphic image of a ring of matrices over where every entry on or below the main diagonal is a multiple of . in fact for nilpotent rings it is enough to consider the equation solvability problem over such a matrix ring , since if the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time for , then it is solvable in polynomial time for a factor , as well . indeed , let be a polynomial over and be any polynomial over whose factor by is . then is solvable over if and only if is solvable over for some . this gives an extra factor to the running time . however , , and we have , . thus , , which only depends on , and thus can be forgotten about . thus it is enough to consider the sigma equation solvability problem over such a matrix ring of matrices over where every entry on or below the main diagonal of each matrix is a multiple of . we can handle such matrix rings similarly as we do with the semmipattern groups . hence we can use ideas of the proof described in section . we give a new , efficient algorithm that decides the equation solvability problem over nilpotent matrix rings in section . in this section we consider the equation solvability problem over semmipattern groups . first we characterize the multiplication of matrices from in lemma . we use this formula in our algorithm . let n be a natural number . for every let let then * for every we have * for every we have + the length of is , and in particular is polynomial in . the lemma can be proved by induction on . however , instead of giving the technical induction proof , we explain how one can arrive at this formula . let us consider the element of the row of the matrix . we can express this element with a sum of some appropriate products . in every such product we multiply one element from each matrix . ( in the notation the index appears as the last index . ) furthermore the index of the column of a term must equal with the index of the row of the following term in every such product . ( therefore a term of the form or follows the term of the form or . ) the row index of the first term is , the column index of the last term is . the matrices are upper triangular matrices , hence the row index of every term of every product is less than or equal to the column index . ( thus for every term of the form , that are above the diagonal , we have . ) thus the element of the row of the matrix is a sum of products of terms such that * the row index of the first term is , the column index of the last term is ; * the column index of every term equals to the row index of the next term ; * the row index of a term is at most the row index of the next term . notice , that every -term product is uniquely determined by those terms where the row index differs from the column index . let two such consecutive terms of the product be and . ( here and . ) the product of the terms between these two terms have row and column index and their last index is more than and less than . thus between the terms and can only be the product . thus formula is proved . now , we calculate the length of formula . formula is a sum of products . the length of every product is , thus we need to calculate the number of products . notice , that every product is uniquely determined by the column indices of the terms . more exactly we need to know the column indices of the first terms , because the column index of the last term is . we can choose these indices from the set . the order of the selected elements does not matter . we only need to determine how many indices are equal to or to , etc , or to . thus we need to choose element from a set of elements such that repetitions are allowed . hence the number of products is since every product has length , the length of is thus the length of is at most for every index . let be a semipattern group . let be a polynomial over . thus can indicate a constant or a variable over . of course and can indicate the same constant or variable . let if indicates constant then is a constant in and is a constant in . if is a variable , then is a variable , that we can substitute from , and is a variable that we can substitute from . furthermore if and only if ( for every ) and for every . we can rewrite the polynomial with this notation as after multiplying these matrices using lemma we obtain where the polynomial can attain the unit matrix for a substitution if and only if attains  and attains for the same substitution  . thus is solvable over if and only if the system of equations is solvable over . this is a system of equations over where the polynomials are given as sums of monomials . hence we can decide the solvability of this system of equations in polynomial time by theorem . the rewriting of over into the system of equations over can be done in time by lemma , and the length of each equation is . the number of equations is , which does not depend on , only on the group . by theorem one can decide whether this system has a solution in time . let be a ring of matrices over where every entry on or below the main diagonal of each matrix in is a multiple of . let be a polynomial over given as a sum of monomials . let denote a monomial in the sum . let if indicates constant then are constants in . if is a variable , then are variables , that we can substitute from . furthermore , if and only if and for every . first is a polynomial given as a sum of monomials over . in every such monomial we multiply one term from each matrix . hence the length of every monomial is . there are at most monomials in every polynomial according to the usual multiplication of matrices . however , every nonzero monomial contains at most terms from on or below the main diagonal , since the characteristic of is . therefore every nonzero monomial is of the form where and . notice that holds as well . indeed , every term is from above the main diagonal , hence . therefore and thus . similarly . hence the length of every nonzero monomial is at most . in particular , if then every monomial in equals . therefore there are at most monomials in every polynomial and thus . the input polynomial is a sum of at most monomials . let then is the sum of at most -many polynomials for every . thus , as and depend only on the ring . the polynomial can attain the zero matrix for a substitution if and only if attains zero for the same substitution for every . thus is solvable over if and only if the system of equations is solvable over . this is a system of equations over where the polynomials are given as sums of monomials . hence we can decide the solvability of this system of equations in polynomial time by theorem . the rewriting of over into the system of equations can be done in time , and . the number of equations is , which does not depend on , only on the ring . by theorem one can decide whether this system has a solution in time . finally , we explain how this result can be applied to determine if an equation is solvable over an arbitrary nilpotent ring of characteristic . let be the matrix ring as in theorem , and let . further , let denote the polynomial in corresponding to . notice , that was the characteristic of in theorem , hence . furthermore and . therefore . hence , one can decide if is solvable over in time . thus , one can decide if the equation is solvable over in time . now , , which only depends on . therefore , if is given as a sum of monomials , then , and one can decide over an arbitrary nilpotent ring in time , as well . if , however , is an arbitrary polynomial over , then after rewriting it as a sum of monomials we have , giving an extra factor in the exponent . thus , one can decide over an arbitrary nilpotent ring in time . mikael goldmann and alexander russell . the complexity of

{"article": "gliese 229b is not only the first brown dwarf recognized as genuine , but it is also the brightest and best - studied t dwarf known . with an effective temperature of k , it lies squarely between the latest l dwarfs ( k , ) and the giant planets of the solar system ( k ) . indeed , its near infrared spectrum shows the strong ho absorption bands characteristic of very - low mass stars and the strong ch bands seen in the spectra of jupiter , saturn and titan . the transitional nature of the spectrum of gl 229b is remarkable and hints at the spectral appearance of extrasolar giant planets which have effective temperatures in the range 200 1600k . a wealth of data on gl 229b has accumulated since its discovery five years ago . broad band photometry from through and an accurate parallax allow an accurate determination of its bolometric luminosity . spectroscopic observations covering the range from 0.8 to 5.0 m have revealed a very rapidly declining flux shortward of 1 m , the unmistakable presence of ch , ho , and cs , and demonstrated the absence of the crh , feh , vo and tio features characteristic of late m and early l dwarfs . finally , noll , geballe & marley ( 1997 ) and have detected co with an abundance well above the value predicted by chemical equilibrium , a phenomenon also seen in the atmosphere of jupiter . model spectra for gl 229b reproduce the overall energy distribution fairly well and all agree that 1 ) k , 2 ) compared to gaseous molecular opacity , the dust opacity is small if not negligible in the infrared , 3 ) the gravity of gl 229b is poorly constrained at present . the rapid decline of the flux at wavelengths shortward of 1 m is interpreted as caused by an absorbing haze of complex hydrocarbons ( griffith , yelle & marley 1998 ) or alternatively by the pressure - broadened red wing of the k i resonance doublet at 0.77 m ( tsuji , ohnaka & aoki 1999 ; burrows , marley & sharp 1999 ) . in this paper , we present new high - resolution spectra in the , , and bands . with the inclusion of the `` red '' spectrum of , we analyze each part of the spectrum separately to obtain independent measures of the ho abundance of gl 229b broadly interpreted as the metallicity index to detect for the first time the presence of nh in its spectrum , and to estimate the nh abundance at two different depths in the atmosphere . our results are expressed in terms of the surface gravity which can not be determined from the data presented here . nevertheless , we identify a reduced set of acceptable combinations of and gravity , using the observed bolometric luminosity of gl 229b . the observations and the near infrared spectra are presented in 2 . section 3 shows how an accurate parallax , a well - sampled spectral energy distribution and evolutionary models greatly reduce the possible range of combinations of and gravity without having to resort to spectrum fitting . the synthetic spectrum calculation and our method of analysis are described in 4 . the results concerning several molecules of interest which are at least potentially detectable are presented in 5 , followed by a discussion in 6 . finally , a summary of the results and directions for future study are given in 7 . spectra of gl 229b in selected narrow intervals in the , , and windows were obtained at the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in 1998 january , using the facility spectrometer cgs4 and its 150 l / mm grating . details of the observations are provided in table 1 . these are among the highest resolution spectra obtained of any t dwarf . the spectra were obtained in the standard stare / nod mode with the wide slit of the spectrometer oriented at a position angle of , nearly perpendicular to the line connecting gl 229a and gl 229b . the southward - going diffraction spike of gl 229a together with scattered light from that star , which is 10 magnitudes brighter than gl 229b , contaminated the array rows near and to the southwest of those containing the spectrum of gl 229b . the contamination on the gl 229b rows was determined by interpolation and was subtracted ; typically it was comparable or somewhat smaller than the signal from gl 229b . in order to remove telluric absorption features , spectra of the a0v star bs 1849 were measured just prior to gl 229b . in all cases the match in airmasses was better than five percent and hence in the ratioed spectra residual telluric features are small compared to the noise level . wavelength calibration was achieved by observations of arc lamps and is in all cases better than one part in  . the spectra shown in this paper have been slightly smoothed , so that the resolving powers are lower than those in table 1 by approximately 25 percent . they also have been rebinned to facilitate coadding like spectra and joining adjacent spectral regions . the error bars can be judged by the point - to - point variations in featureless portions of the spectra , the signal - to - noise ratios at the continuum peaks are approximately 40 in the band , 25 in the band , and 30 in the band . the flux calibration of each spectrum is approximate as no attempt was made to match the photometry of gl 229b . while we identify the spectra by their corresponding standard photometric infrared bandpass , their wavelength coverages are much narrower than the filters and typically corresponds to the peak flux of gl 229b in each bandpass . in the band spectrum ( fig . 1 ) , nearly all features are caused by ho . the short wavelength end of the spectrum shows the red side of a ch band , which is responsible for the features seen shortward of m . two lines of neutral potassium are easily detected near m . no other lines of alkali metals fall within the wavelength coverage of our observations . the band spectrum ( fig . 2 ) is relatively rich in molecular opacity sources . all the features seen in the spectrum are either due to ho ( m ) or part of a very strong ch absorption band ( m ) . features seen between 1.59 and 1.6 m can not presently be ascribed with certainty and are due to either ho or ch . while the opacities of nh and hs are not negligible in this part of the spectrum , neither molecule forms distinctive spectral features . their presence can not be directly ascertained from these data , mainly because their opacity is weaker than that of ho and ch and because of significant pressure broadening ( see 5.3 ) . the band flux emerges in an opacity window between a strong ho band and a strong ch band ( fig . spectral features are caused by ho at shorter wavelengths ( m ) and by ch at longer wavelengths ( m ) . several distinctive features of nh are expected at the blue end of this spectrum and models predict a single absorption feature of hs at m . all features seen in figures 1 3 are unresolved blends of numerous molecular transitions . a spectral resolution at least 10 times higher would be required to resolve the intrinsic structure of the spectrum of gl 229b . while synthetic spectra have been fairly successful at reproducing the unusual spectrum of gl 229b , the entire spectral energy distribution has not yet been modeled satisfactorily . limitations in the opacity databases are partly responsible for the remaining discrepancies between synthetic spectra and the data ( see 4.2 ) . these shortcomings have impeded the determination of and of the gravity in particular . on the other hand , the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b is now well determined . combining spectroscopic and photometric data from 0.82 to 10 m with the parallax , found . with new photometry , found . a recalibration using the hst photometry of gives . evolutionary models allow us to find a family of models with a given . figure 4 shows the cooling tracks of solar metallicity brown dwarfs in terms of the surface parameters and . models with the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b fall within the band running through the center of the figure . using a very conservative lower limit for the age of gl 229a of 0.2gyr , we find k . on the other hand , the gravity remains poorly determined with , corresponding to a mass range of 0.015 0.07 . while the upper range is very close to the lower main sequence mass limit , gl 229b s status as a brown dwarf is secure . a star at the edge of the main sequence would be much hotter with k ; well outside of fig . 4 . in the remainder of this paper , the discussion focuses on three atmosphere models which span the range of allowed solutions ( table 2 and fig . 4 ) : ( 870 , 4.5 ) , ( 940 , 5.0 ) and ( 1030 , 5.5 ) , which we label models a , b , and c , respectively . these constraints on and from cooling sequences are quite firm . we find the same result , within the error bar on , from several cooling sequences which predate . the latter were computed with different input physics such as the equation of state and surface boundary conditions derived from grey and non - grey atmosphere models using several opacity tabulations . in section 5 , we show that these three models can fit the spectra only if they have different metallicities , ranging from to . the evolution of brown dwarfs is sensitive to the metallicity through the atmospheric opacity which controls the rate of cooling . we find that for the range of interest here , the effect of a reduced metallicity on our determination of , , and the cooling age is smaller but comparable to that of the uncertainty on the value of . we choose to ignore it for simplicity . our analysis is based on the atmosphere models of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets described in . briefly , the atmospheres are in radiative / convective equilibrium and the equation of radiative transfer is solved with the k - coefficient method . the chemical equilibrium is treated as in . gas phase opacities include rayleigh scattering , the collision - induced opacity of h and the molecular opacities of ho , ch , nh , hs , ph , and co , as well as the continuum opacities of h and h . the molecular line opacity database is described in more detail in 4.2 . atomic line opacity is not included . because of the relatively large gravity of gl 229b , pressure broadening of the molecular lines plays an important role in determining the profile of the atmosphere and in shaping the spectrum . the line - by - line broadening theory we use is described in . the strong continuum opacity source responsible for the rapid decrease of the flux of gl 229b shortward of 1.1 m is included following the haze model of . details of the haze model and of our fitting procedure are given in 5.1 . the structures of these atmosphere models are shown in fig . the profiles intersect each other because both and the gravity vary between the models . the inflexion point at signals the top of the convection zone . using the same monochromatic opacities used to compute the k - coefficients , high - resolution synthetic spectra are generated from the atmospheric structures by solving the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier method on a frequency grid with . spectra with resolution lower than can then be generated for comparison with data . an unusual aspect of t dwarf atmospheres is the great variation of the opacity with wavelength . these atmospheres are strongly non - grey and the near infrared spectrum is sculpted by strong absorption bands of ho and ch . most of the flux emerges in a small number of relatively transparent opacity windows . the concept of photosphere becomes rather useless since the level at which the spectrum is formed depends strongly on the wavelength . figure 6 shows the depth of the `` photosphere '' in both temperature and pressure as a function of wavelength for model b ( k , ) . in the , , and bands , and , to a lesser extent , in the and bands , the atmosphere is very transparent and can be probed to great depths . for m , the spectral energy distribution approaches a planck function with k . figure 6 reveals that spectroscopy between 0.8 and 12 m can probe the atmosphere from k down to a depth where k , corresponding to a range of 6 pressure scale heights ! this provides an exceptional opportunity to study the physics of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf over an extended vertical range . the top of the convection zone for model b ( located at k ) is below the `` photosphere '' at all wavelengths and is not directly observable , however . given the range of acceptable values of and ( 3 ) , we can determine the metallicity of gl 229b and the abundance of several key molecules by fitting synthetic spectra to the observations , for each of the three models . the precision of our results is determined by the reliability of the models , the noise level in the data and , most significantly , by the limitations of the molecular line lists used to compute their opacities . the latter point requires a detailed discussion . the opacities of ch and nh are computed from line lists obtained by combining the hitran and geisa databases , which are complemented with recent laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations . further details are provided in . the resulting line lists for these two molecules are very nearly complete for k , and their degree of completeness decreases rapidly at higher temperatures where absorption from excited level become important . furthermore , the line list of ch is limited to m . we extend the ch opacity to shorter wavelengths with the laboratory measurements of which provide the absorption coefficient averaged over intervals of 5 between 1 and 5 m at k . we use opacities for m and the line list for m . this puts the transition from one tabulation to the other in a strong ho absorption band and obliterates any discontinuity in ch opacity at the transition . for m , the tabulation of gives the absorption coefficient of ch determined from spectroscopic observations of the giant planets at 0.0004 m intervals . because of the low temperatures found in the atmospheres of giant planets , the karkoschka ch opacities are appropriate for k . to our knowledge , this compilation of nh and ch opacity is the most complete presently available . as can be seen in figure 6 , the temperature in the atmosphere of gl 229b is everywhere greater than 300k . for ch , we compute temperature - dependent line opacity ( which is incomplete above 300k ) from the population of excited levels determined by the boltzmann formula for m , and use temperature independent opacity at shorter wavelengths . while the synthetic spectra computed reproduce the fundamental band of ch very well ( centered at m ) , the match with the 1.6 and 2.3 m bands is rather poor . even though ch is a very prominent molecule in the spectrum of gl 229b , the current knowledge of its opacity is not adequate for a quantitative analysis of its spectral signature . for this reason , we have essentially ignored the regions in our spectra where ch is prominent . unfortunately , this prevents us from estimating the abundance of ch and therefore of carbon in gl 229b . ammonia shows significant absorption in both the and band spectra . the line list for nh starts at m . because the line list does not include transitions from highly excited levels which occur at k , the nh opacity we compute at a given wavelength is strictly a lower limit to the actual opacity . except for the collision - induced absorption by h , the most important molecular absorber in gl 229b is ho , for which the opacity is now relatively well understood . we use the most recent and most extensive ab initio line list ( , transitions ) . this line list is essentially complete for k . as a demonstration of the equality of this database , we find that the ho features computed with this line list correspond extremely well in frequency with the observed features of gl 229b ( e.g. figs . 7 to 9 ) . however , we find noticeable discrepancies in the relative strengths of ho features which we attribute to the calculated oscillator strength of the transitions ( 5.1 ) . this effect can also be seen in fig . 1c of . at high resolution , the distribution of molecular transitions in frequency and strength is nearly random , and the inaccuracies in oscillator strengths we have found limit the accuracy of model fitting in a fashion similar to noise . this `` opacity noise '' is at least as significant as the noise intrinsic to our data . we have constructed a grid of synthetic spectra for the three models shown in fig . 4 with metallicity } \\le 0.1 $ ] in steps of 0.1 . we use these modeled spectra to fit four distinct spectral regions ( the `` red '' , , , and spectra ) separately to determine the metallicity as a function of gravity with an internal precision of dex . for the purpose of fitting the data , the synthetic spectra were renormalized to the observed flux at a selected wavelength in each spectral region . the model spectra show some distortions in the overall shape of the spectrum which are probably due to remaining uncertainties in the profile of the atmosphere , the inadequate ch opacities , and possible effects of dust opacity . considering the additional problems with the strength of the ho features , we elected to do all fits `` by eye , '' except where otherwise noted . we discuss the fitting of each spectral interval below . in the interest of brevity , we present a detailed discussion of fits obtained only with the model of intermediate gravity ( model b ) . the best fits obtained with models a and c are very nearly identical to those with model b. the results are summarized in table 2 . the `` red '' spectrum extends from 0.83 to m and is formed deep in the atmosphere where k . the spectra of and reveal two lines of cs i ( at 0.852 and 0.894 m ) and a strong ho band but not the bands of tio and vo common to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs ( fig . 7 ) . refractory elements , such as ti , fe , v , ca , and cr , are expected to be bound in condensed compounds in a low - temperature atmosphere such as that of gl 229b and therefore are not available to form molecular bands . with the exception of the strong , unidentified feature at 0.9874 m , all features between 0.89 and 1.0 m can be attributed to ho . an overlap of a weak band of ho and a weaker ch band causes the small depression at 0.894 m which was tentatively tentatively attributed to ch by and . features below 0.89 m can not be identified at present . the two cs i lines are not included in our model . the flux from gl 229b is also observed to decrease very rapidly toward shorter wavelengths , which , in the absence of the strong tio and vo bands , is evidently caused by the presence of a missing source of opacity in the atmosphere . spectra computed with molecular opacities only ( but excluding tio , vo , feh , etc ) predict visible fluxes which are grossly overestimated but the detailed sequence of absorption features of the spectrum are well reproduced , indicating that the short wavelength flux is suppressed by a opacity source . we fit the red spectrum of gl 229b between 0.82 and 1.15 m to obtain the metallicity . we have recalibrated the published spectrum using the hst photometry of . we model the continuum opacity with a layer of condensates following the approach of . condensates are expected in the atmosphere of gl 229b on the basis of chemical equilibrium calculations and can provide the required opacity . alternatively , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ( 1999 ) and burrows , marley , & sharp ( 1999 ) attribute this rapid decline to the pressure broadened red wing of the 0.77 m k i resonance doublet . the first optical spectrum of a t dwarf ( sdss 1624 + 0029 ) shows that the latter explanation is correct . the nature of this opacity source is not very important for the determination of the metallicity , however , as long as the proper continuum opacity background is present in the calculation . the dust opacity is computed with the mie theory of scattering by spherical particles and is determined by the vertical distribution of the particles , their grain size distribution , and the complex index of refraction of the condensate . the cloud model of is described by 1 ) the vertical density profile of the condensate , taken as : where is the number density of condensed particles , is the ambient gas pressure , and the cloud layer is bound by 2 ) the size distribution of the particles ^ 2,\\ ] ] where is the diameter of the particles ; and 3 ) the complex index of refraction of the condensate the parameters , , , , the function , and the metallicity of the atmosphere are free parameters . such a multi - parameter fit of the observed spectrum is not unique . furthermore , arbitrarily good fits of the `` continuum '' flux level can be obtained by adjusting the imaginary part of the index of refraction since its wavelength dependence is weakly constrained a priori . our results for the three models are qualitatively similar to those of . typical values of the fitted dust parameters are bar , bar , m , and , with the imaginary part of the index of refraction decreasing from at 0.8 m to 0.01 at 1.10 m . these parameters applied to model b with a metallicity of = result in the fit shown in figure 7 . the metallicity of the atmosphere is largely independent of the dust parameters , however , as it is constrained by the amplitude of the features in the ho band which we fit between 0.925 and 0.98 m . a larger metallicity results in a larger amplitude of the features inside the band . we obtain the same value of as long as a good fit of the `` continuum '' flux level is obtained , regardless of the particular values of dust parameters . the lower panel of fig . 7 clearly shows differences in the relative strengths of the absorption features in the ho band between the synthetic and observed spectra . similar differences also occur in the , , and bands . the same differences are found for all three atmospheric profiles and point to inaccuracies in the oscillator strength of the ab initio line list of ho . the metallicity is fitted to give the best overall fit of these features with a precision of dex . strictly speaking , this procedure gives the ho abundance , or rather than . for solar metallicity , the condensation of silicates deep in the atmosphere of gl 229b will reduce the amount of oxygen available to form ho by % which implies that } = { \\rm } + 0.07.\\ ] ] the correction , which decreases for subsolar metallicities , is smaller than our fitting uncertainty and will be ignored hereafter . the band spectrum probes the most transparent window of the spectrum of gl 229b and is formed at great depth where k and bar ( fig . 6 ) . our spectrum contains almost exclusively ho features , with the exception of ch absorption for m and of two prominent k i lines ( fig . since we have elected to ignore ch bands and our synthetic spectra do not include alkali metal lines , we fit the spectrum between 1.215 and 1.298 m to determine the metallicity from the depth of the ho absorption features . figure 8 shows the effect of the metallicity on the spectrum ( top panel ) and our best fit ( bottom panel ) for model b. the flux level in the spectrum varies by a factor of 3 and our best fit shows distortions in the general shape of the spectrum . the distortions may be caused by a combination of uncertainties in the profile of the atmosphere , problems with the ho opacities or a small amount of dust opacity in the infrared spectrum of gl 229b ( not modeled ) . since the fit is based on the depth of the features , we ignore these distortions and fit the logarithm of the flux rather than the flux , as shown in fig . 8 . as in the red spectrum ( 5.1 ) , we find a remarkable correspondence of spectral features between the observed and modeled spectra although the model spectrum is somewhat less successful at reproducing the relative strengths of the ho features . while the band spectrum falls between the red side of a strong ho band ( for m ) and the blue side of a prominent ch band ( for m ) , nh and hs have non - negligible opacity in this wavelength interval which also includes a band of co. the strong ch band is responsible for the turnover of the flux at 1.59 m . in this wavelength range , the ch opacity is described in our calculation by the laboratory measurements which are restricted to k . as a consequence , the ch band comes in at 1.61 m in the synthetic spectra , which results in strong departures of the mean flux level between data and models for m . this limits our analysis of the band spectrum to wavelengths shorter than 1.58 m . in this wavelength range , the spectrum is formed deep in the atmosphere , where k and bar ( fig . 6 ) . within this spectral region , we determine the abundance of nh as a function of the metallicity , but can not untangle the two . we also comment on the presence of hs and co. while nh absorption can significantly affect the slope of the spectrum shortward of 1.56 m ( fig . 9 ) , there is no distinctive feature at this spectral resolution  to provide an unambiguous detection of this molecule . the detection of co at 4.7 m well above the equilibrium abundance suggests the possibility that nh may also depart from its chemical equilibrium abundance . we therefore vary the abundance of nh by reducing its chemical equilibrium abundance as computed for a given metallicity uniformly throughout the atmosphere by constant factor . we found that reduction factors of 1 , 0.5 , 0.25 , and 0 provide an adequate grid of nh abundances given the s / n ratio of the data and the residual problems with the ho opacity . the effect of varying the metallicity on the band spectrum is shown in fig . 10 for model b. all spectra in figure 10 were computed with the equilibrium abundance of nh . in this case , we find a best fitting metallicity of . figures 9 and 10 show that varying the abundance of nh and varying the metallicity have very similar effects on the synthetic spectrum . in the absence of any distinctive feature of nh , it is not possible to determine both the metallicity and the nh abundance separately . for each value of , we can adjust the nh abundance to obtain a good fit , higher metallicities requiring lower nh abundances . the best fitting solutions are given in table 2 . these fits are nearly indistinguishable from each other although the higher metallicity fits are marginally better . it is in the band that we find the poorest match in the detailed features of the data and the models . while the fit is determined by matching the relative amplitudes of the features , the two - parameter fit ( metallicity and nh abundance ) we have performed amounts to little more than fitting the slope of the spectrum . as an internal check on our fitting procedure and precision , we have have verified that our fits indeed have the same slope as the data by plotting data and models at a very low spectral resolution which eliminates all absorption features . hydrogen sulfide ( hs ) has non - negligible opacity over most of the wavelength range of our fit to the band . figure 11 shows two spectra computed with and without hs opacity . its opacity is weaker than that of nh however , and there are no distinctive features which would allow a positive identification . since the hs features are fairly uniformly distributed in strength and wavelength , fitting the spectrum with either the chemical equilibrium abundance of hs or with no hs at all only has a small - to - negligible effect on the determination of the nh abundance for a given metallicity ( table 2 ) . for the low gravity model a , the nh abundance determined from spectra without hs is about half of the value found with the chemical equilibrium abundance of hs . the difference decreases at higher gravities and is negligible for model c. chemical equilibrium calculations indicate that hs is present in gl 229b with an abundance essentially equal to the elemental abundance of sulfur in the atmosphere ( see 6.3 for further discussion ) . unfortunately , we are unable to ascertain the presence of hs in the atmosphere of gl 229b at present . the discovery of co in the 4.7 m spectrum of gl 229b with an abundance about 3 orders of magnitude higher than predicted by chemical equilibrium revealed the importance of dynamical processes in its atmosphere . the 4.7 m spectrum probes the atmosphere at the 2 3 bar level where k ( fig . 6 ) . at this level , chemical equilibrium calculations predict a co abundance of while found . the second overtone band of co falls within the band and , in principle , could provide a determination of at a deeper level of the atmosphere , where bar and k ( fig . 6 ) . figure 12 shows a comparison of the data with synthetic spectra computed with various amounts of co for model b with solar metallicity . the first two spectra are computed with the chemical equilibrium abundance of co ( at 14bar ) and without co  . these two spectra are very nearly identical . a third spectrum is computed in the unrealistic limit where all the carbon in the atmosphere is in the form of co  , which represents the maximum possible co enhancement . as we found for nh and hs , there is no distinctive spectral signature of co at this resolution  . our extreme case represents a flux reduction of at best . we are unable to constrain the co abundance with our data . since the band of co is times weaker than the fundamental band at 4.7 m , obtaining a useful co abundance from band spectroscopy will be a difficult undertaking . of our three near infrared spectra , the band spectrum is formed highest in the atmosphere : 1020k and bar ( fig . this is the same level as is probed with 4.7 m spectroscopy . as in the band , the spectrum contains mainly ho features on the blue side ( m ) and a strong ch band appears at longer wavelengths . there are also several nh features for m and the models predict an isolated feature of hs ( fig . 3 ) . figure 13 compares a spectrum computed for model b with with the entire band spectrum . there is an excellent agreement in the structure of the spectrum even though the overall shape is not very well reproduced . for m , the model predicts strong features of nh which we discuss in the next section . beyond 2.12 m is a ch band which is too weak in the model . the structure within the modeled band is remarkably similar to the observed spectrum , however . this much better agreement of the ch band than we obtained in the band is due to two factors . first , in this band the ch opacity is computed from a line list , and can therefore be computed as a function of temperature rather than at a fixed value of 300k . second , the lower temperature where the band is formed ( fig . 6 ) reduces the effect of the incompleteness of the ch line list above 300k . nevertheless , we do not consider the ch features here and limit our analysis to m . the band spectrum provides a unique opportunity : once the metallicity is determined by matching the depth of the ho features between 2.05 and 2.10 m , the abundance of nh can be obtained by fitting its features below 2.05 m . the fit of the metallicity is shown in fig . 14 for model b , which shows =0 and ( top panel ) and our best fit , = ( bottom panel ) . values for models a and c are given in table 2 . all features in this region are due to ho and , as we found in the red spectrum and in the and bands , the oscillator strengths of the ho line list do not reproduce the relative strength of the observed features very well . in the wavelength range shown in fig . 15 , the spectrum consists of a few nh features on a background of ho absorption . synthetic spectra predict seven strong nh features in this spectrum , three of which are clearly present ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046 m ) , one is absent ( 2.041 m ) and three appear to be missing ( 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031 m ) . this constitutes an ambiguous detection of nh in gl 229b . the determination of the abundance of nh from the band spectrum is hampered by the limited accuracy of the oscillator strengths of the ho line list and by the incompleteness of our nh line list for temperatures above 300k . the effect of the former can be seen in the trio of features at 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031 m , which overlap ho absorption features . even after removing all nh opacity , these features are still too strong in the calculated spectrum ( top panel of fig . the top panel of fig . 15 as well as fig . 13 show that for model b , the abundance of nh derived from the chemical equilibrium for the adopted metallicity of is too high . we therefore consider a depletion in nh in the atmosphere of gl 229b at the level probed by the band spectrum . following the approach used in fitting the band spectrum , we express this depletion as a fraction of the chemical equilibrium abundance of nh for the metallicity obtained independently from the amplitude of the ho features in the band . this fraction is applied uniformly throughout the atmosphere for the computation of the synthetic spectrum . given the ambiguous presence of nh in the band , we have determined the optimal nh abundance by minimizing the of the spectral fit for m . this gives a depletion factor of with no nh present being an acceptable fit . restricting the fit to the region where nh features are clearly observed  gives a similar result but favors a finite value for the nh depletion of . the results are summarized in table 2 . the lower panel of figure 15 shows the model b fit obtained by reducing the nh abundance throughout the atmosphere to % of its chemical equilibrium value for the adopted metallicity . with this significant degree of depletion , the model reproduces the three detected features ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046 m ) extremely well and makes the 2.041 m feature consistent with the observations . because our nh line list is incomplete at high temperatures , the opacity which we compute is strictly a lower limit to the actual nh opacity at any wavelength . if the incompleteness is significant for the features found in the band spectrum , then the nh abundance is actually lower still . it appears extremely unlikely that the errors in the oscillator strength of the ho transitions would conspire to mimic the depletion of nh which we find . for example , if we imagine that there is no nh depletion ( dotted curve in the top panel of fig . 14 ) , the residuals between the data and the fitted spectrum for m would be much larger than the typical mismatch which we find in ho features in all four spectra presented here . we consider the depletion of nh in the band spectrum to be firmly established . we are not able to establish the presence of hs from our band spectrum ( 5.3.2 ) . throughout the band , the hs opacity is generally overwhelmed by ho and ch absorption . however , there is a peak in the opacity of hs which is about one order of magnitude higher than all other opacity maxima ( fig . our synthetic spectra indicate that this feature is strong enough to become visible in the midst of the background of ho and ch features . figure 17 shows the relevant portion of the band spectrum with synthetic spectra for all three models ( a , b , and c ) using the fitted metallicity ( table 2 ) . all three panels are remarkably similar . the strength of the predicted feature is well above the noise level of the data , and taken at face value , figure 17 indicates a probable depletion of hs by more than a factor of 2 . on the other hand , chemical equilibrium calculations indicate that the hs abundance should be very near the elemental abundance of sulfur , even in the presence of vertical transport and condensation . since there is no reason to expect a significant depletion of hs , the discrepancy is probably due to remaining uncertainties in the opacities . our hs line list is based on an ab initio calculation ( r. wattson , priv . which hasnt been compared to laboratory data in this part of the spectrum . the strong feature centered at 2.1084 m is a blend of three strong lines from three different bands of hs . possible errors in the position or strength of these lines could significantly reduce the amplitude of the feature in our synthetic spectra . the limitations of the background opacity of ho and ch may also be responsible for the observed mismatch . nevertheless , it is desirable to look for this feature at a higher resolution and a higher s / n ratio as an absence of sulfur in gl 229b would be a most intriguing result . given our determination of and in terms of the surface gravity , we can obtain the abundance of co from the 45 m spectra of and which is consistent with our results . for each model a , b , and c and using the metallicity given in table 2 , we computed synthetic spectra with various co abundances . the latter is varied freely without imposing stoichiometric constraints . the synthetic spectra are binned to the wavelength grid of the data and fitted to the data by a normalization factor adjusted to minimize the . the of the fitted spectra shows a well - defined minimum as a function of the co abundance , ( table 3 ) . the uncertainty on the co abundance is obtained by generating synthetic data sets by adding a gaussian distribution of the observed noise to the best fitting model spectrum . after doing the same analysis on 1000 synthetic data sets , we obtain a ( non - gaussian ) distribution of values of . the uncertainties given in table 3 correspond to the 68% confidence level . the spectrum gives co abundances which are 0.1 dex higher than those obtained from the spectrum ; which is well within the fitting uncertainty . found a co mole fraction of 50 to 200 ppm  by assuming a ho abundance of 300 ppm ( effectively , ) , which agrees well with our result for model a which has . our results are also consistent with those of who find co abundances of and ppm ( and ) for = and 0 , respectively , using the data of . since this part of the spectrum contains only ho and co features , our fitting procedure is sensitive only to the co to ho abundance ratio . chemical equilibrium calculations show that the ho abundance scales linearly with the metallicity at the level probed with 45 m spectroscopy ( i.e. all the gas phase oxygen is in ho ) . accordingly , the co abundance we find scales with the metallicity of the model . as shown in figure 18 , the co abundance determined from the 4.7 m band corresponds approximately to the co / ch transition in chemical equilibrium . the observations definitely exclude the very - low chemical equilibrium abundance of co. the fact that the extreme case where all carbon is co provides an acceptable fit to the data ( while we know that a good fraction of the carbon is in ch ) is due to the rather noisy spectra . it is highly desirable to restrict the surface gravity of gl 229b to an astrophysically useful range . since is known , a determination of fixes , the radius , the mass , and the age of gl 229b ( fig . 4 ) , as well as the metallicity and the abundances of important molecules such as co and nh . the large uncertainty on results in a large uncertainty in the mass of gl 229b and on the age of the system determined from cooling tracks . while a dynamical determination of the mass may be possible in a decade or so , a spectroscopic determination might be obtained much sooner . unfortunately , it is not possible to constrain the gravity better than with the data and models presently available . our high resolution spectroscopy does not allow us to choose between models a , b and c ( table 2 ) as an increase in gravity can be compensated by an increase in metallicity to lead to an identical fit . the gravity sensitivity of the band synthetic spectrum models reported by occurs for a fixed metallicity only . similarly , and report that the spectral energy distribution of gl 229b models is fairly sensitive to the gravity . but this is true only for a fixed metallicity . for the three models indicated in fig . 4 , and using the metallicity we have determined for each ( table 2 ) the gravity dependence of the infrared colors is and and ( table 4 ) . this dependence is very weak in the light of the uncertainty in the photometry of gl 229b . more problematic is the fact that the synthetic disagrees with the photometry . furthermore , the incomplete ch opacities used in the spectrum calculation almost certainly result in an inaccurate redistribution of the flux in the near infrared opacity windows which determines the broad band colors . an example of this effect on the band flux can be seen in fig . we conclude that a photometric determination of the gravity is not possible at present . an alternative approach to determining the gravity of gl 229b is through a study of the pressure - broadened molecular lines of its spectrum . the spectrum of gl 229b is formed of a forest of unresolved molecular lines maily due to ho , ch , and nh . because of the limitations of the ch and nh opacity data bases , a detailed study of molecular features is best performed in spectral domains where these two molecules do not contribute significantly to the opacity . spectroscopic observations with a resolution of can reveal the shape of individual ho lines in regions where they are relatively sparse , e.g. from 2.08 to 2.105 m . our determination of the metallicity of gl 229b , with an uncertainty of , is given in table 2 for the three gravities considered . we find an excellent agreement between our three independent determinations of for each gravity and conclude that gl 229b is likely to be depleted in heavy elements , e.g. oxygen . the metallicity is near solar at high gravity and decreases significantly for lower gravities . in their analysis of the `` red '' spectrum , found a ho abundance between 0.3 and 0.45 of the solar value for a k , model and they adopt a value of 0.25 in . metal depletion in gl 229b is consistent with the analysis of the 0.985 1.02 m feh band in the spectrum of the primary star gl 229a by schiavon , barbuy & singh ( 1997 ) who find . the infrared colors of gl 229a imply that it is slightly metal - rich , however . the relative metallicity of the components of this binary system may have been affected by their formation process . if the pair formed from the fragmentation of a collapsing cloud ( like a binary star system ) , the two objects should share the same composition . if the brown dwarf formed like a planet , from accretion within a dissipative keplerian disk around the primary , the selective accretion of solid phase material could lead to an enrichment in heavy elements compared to the primary star , as is observed in the gaseous planets of the solar system . the low mass of the primary  and the large semi - major axis and eccentricity ( au and , ) suggests that the binary formation process , and therefore equal metallicities , are more plausible . a more detailed study of the metallicity of gl 229a is desirable to better understand the history of this system . the results of our analysis of the metallicity and abundances of several molecules in the atmosphere of gl 229b are summarized in fig each panel corresponds to a different model ( see table 2 ) and shows the abundances of important molecules as a function of depth in the atmosphere based on chemical equilibrium calculations including condensation cloud formation . the chemistry of these abundant molecules is fairly simple . the abundance of ho is uniformly reduced by % by silicate condensation . except for a small depletion for due to the condensation of nas , all sulfur is found in hs . the other molecules shown are not affected by condensation . nitrogen is partitioned between n and nh , with the latter being favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures . nh dominates near the surface and rapidly transforms into n at the higher temperatures found deeper in the atmosphere . deep in the atmosphere , the higher pressures cause a partial recombination of nh and the ratio of the nh to n abundances increases slowly with depth . in a similar fashion , all elemental carbon is found in ch at the surface but co starts to form at higher temperatures and rapidly becomes the most abundant carbon - bearing molecule . the formation of co consumes ho , as can be seen in fig . 18 . in each panel , a dotted box indicates the co abundance we have determined from the 4.7 m spectrum , the location of the box along the ordinate shows the level probed at this wavelength ( fig . 6 ) . as originally discussed by and , the co abundance is orders of magnitude larger than the chemical equilibrium value . stochiometric constraints imply that this also results in a significant reduction of the ch abundance at the 870 950k level in gl 229b . in model b , the equilibrium abundance of ch at 900k is , which corresponds to the abundance of elemental carbon . the co abundance determined from the 4.7 m band is ( with a large error bar ) . conservation of the total number of carbon atoms then requires that the ch abundance be , a full factor of 2 below the equilibrium abundance . if we use the lowest co abundance allowed by our analysis , a 25% reduction of ch relative to its equilibrium abundance at 900k results . depletion of ch at this depth is readily accessible spectroscopically in the 1.6 and 3.3 m bands , and may also affect the 2.3 m band if the non - equilibrium co abundance persists at higher levels ( fig . after ho , ch is the most important near infrared molecular absorber in gl 229b . accurate modeling of the spectrum demands a careful treatment of the non - equilibrium ch abundance . similarly , solid boxes show the nh abundance determined from our and band spectra . while the band abundance is in excellent agreement with the equilibrium value , there is a clear depletion of nh in the band . the and band abundances are marginally consistent with each other but it appears that the nh abundance decreases upwards through the atmosphere . processes which take place faster than the time scale of key chemical reactions can drive the composition of the mixture away from equilibrium . the case of co / ch chemistry has been well - studied in the atmosphere of jupiter where an overabundance of co is also observed . carbon monoxyde is a strongly bound molecule and the conversion of co to ch through the ( schematic ) reaction proceeds relatively slowly , while the reverse reaction is much faster . vertical transport , if vigorous enough , can carry co - rich gas from deeper levels upwards faster than the co to ch reaction can take place . the co / ch ratio at any level is fixed ( `` quenched '' ) by the condition where is the chemical reaction time scale and the dynamical transport time scale . wherever in the presence of a vertical gradient in the equilibrium abundance , non - equilibrium abundances will result . as discussed by , , ( and references therein ) , this naturally explains the very high co abundance observed at the 900k level . in this picture , co - rich gas would be carried upward from k . convection is the most obvious form of vertical transport in a stellar atmosphere but in gl 229b the convection zone remains about 3 pressure scale heights below the level where co is observed ( shaded area in fig . perhaps convective overshooting can transport co to the observed level . propose `` eddy diffusion '' as a slower , yet adequate transport mechanism . the eddy diffusion ( or mixing ) time scale is constrained by the poorly known co abundance and the somewhat uncertain chemical pathway between co and ch . from , we infer that to 10 years and could be much smaller . in analogy to the co / ch equilibrium , a low nh abundance can be explained by vertical transport which can quench the nh/n ratio at a value found in deeper layers in the atmosphere . as it is carried upward , n is converted to nh by the reaction the n molecule is very strongly bound , however , and this reaction proceeds extremely slowly at low temperatures , much more slowly than reaction ( 2 ) . thermochemical kinetic calculations of the chemical lifetime for conversion of n to nh were performed as described in . the time scale for reaction ( 4 ) along the profiles of models a , b , and c and for bar is given by where is in year , is the temperature in k , and is the surface gravity in cm / s . this time scale assumes that the n conversion occurs in the gas phase although it could possibly be shortened by catalysis on the surface of grains . the time scale increases very steeply with decreasing temperature . at the level probed in the band , and and in the band , and ! at some intermediate level ( which depends on ) , the time scale for the conversion of n into nh becomes longer than the age of gl 229b . in view of the relatively very short mixing time scale inferred from the co abundance , it follows that the nh abundance in the and bands is entirely determined by non - equilibrium processes , not by reaction ( 4 ) . at depths where ( which corresponds to the top of the convection zone ) , yr and the reaction proceeds fast enough to establish chemical equilibrium between nh and n . we therefore expect that the n/nh ratio will be quenched at its value at , throughout the remainder of the atmosphere . while the time scale for eddy diffusion increases in the upper levels of the atmosphere , the extremely long ensures that the nh/n ratio remains unchanged , regardless of how slowly the vertical mixing proceeds . for model b , this corresponds to , in perfect agreement with the abundance found in the band ( fig . 18b ) . while the abundance of nh determined from the band spectrum is not very precise , it is marginally consistent with vertical mixing figure 18 shows that it is more likely that the band abundance is smaller than found in the band , however . on the other hand , the abundances shown in fig . 18 and table 2 are depletion factors which were applied uniformly to the chemical equilibrium abundance profile of nh , which has a large vertical gradient . for consistency with the mixed atmosphere picture , we have therefore redetermined nh abundances using a constant abundance throughout the atmosphere and found and from the and band spectra , respectively ( model b ) . the former is in good agreement with our simple prediction while the band value is now rather high . the discrepancy between the and band results thus persists in this new analysis . changes in within the uncertainty have little effect either . we consider the possibility that this vertical gradient in the nh abundance may be caused by a different non - equilibrium process such as the photolysis of nh by the uv flux from the primary star . ammonia is a relatively fragile molecule which is easily dissociated by uv photons : with a photodissociation cross section of cm per molecule , optical depth unity for the photodissociation of nh is reached at pressures of a few millibars in gl 229b . photodissociation of the much more abundant h molecules does not effectively shield nh from incoming uv photons since the two molecules absorb over different wavelength ranges . photodissociation of nh therefore represents a net sink of nh which occurs at the very top of the atmosphere . we can estimate a lower limit to the time scale of photodissociation of nh by assuming that each photodissociating photon results in the destruction of a nh molecule . the incident photon flux is where photons causing dissociation of nh are between and , is the flux at the surface of the primary star , the radius of the primary star and the separation of the binary system . for nh , we have and ( moses , priv . comm . ) . the primary star has a dm1 spectral type , with ergs and cm . the binary separation is au . this results in s . photodissociation will affect significantly the nh abundance when where is the column density of nh . because the incident flux of uv photons is fairly low , this condition is satisfied only at pressures below a few microbars , i.e. very high in the atmosphere . in the region of interest , photodissociation destroys a very small fraction of nh during one mixing time scale and therefore has little effect on the abundance of nh . photolysis of nh can not explain the relatively low nh abundance we find in the band spectrum . we believe that the difference between the and band determinations of the nh abundance arise from the limitations of the nh opacity data used for the calculation of the synthetic spectra . as discussed above , the incompleteness of the nh line list for k results in upper limits for the nh abundances obtained by fitting the data . since this effect increases with temperature , we expect that the abundance determined from the band spectrum is overestimated relative to the one obtained from the band spectrum , which is what we observe . until nh opacities become available for 1200k , we will not be able to quantify this effect . figures 6 and 18 show that ammonia offers a third window of opportunity for a determination of its abundance . the region between 8.3 and 14.4 m is rich in strong nh features , the two strongest being at 10.35 and 10.75 m ( fig . this spectral region probes a higher level in the atmosphere ( k ) where the hot bands of nh which are missing from opacity data bases are less problematic than in the and bands . in this spectral region , the spectrum is very sensitive to the nh/ho ratio , especially for nh abundances below 25% of the equilibrium value ( fig . this would allow a good determination of the degree of nh depletion in the upper levels of the atmosphere . we anticipate that 10 m spectroscopy should reveal a nh abundance of % of its equilibrium value . with the availability of extensive photometric , astrometric , and spectroscopic data , our picture of the atmosphere of gl 229b is gradually becoming more exotic and more complex . the initial discovery of ch in its spectrum set it appart and has prompted the creation of a new spectral class , the t dwarfs . ho , co , cs i , and k i have also been detected . there is good evidence that the rapid decrease of the flux at visible wavelengths is caused by unprecedently broad lines of atomic alkali metals . the presence of condensates may also play a role in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . it is unfortunate that the surface gravity of gl 229b remains poorly constrained . we have not been able to further restrict the allowed range with our new , , and spectroscopy . as a result , all our results are expressed as a function of gravity . this is the most significant obstacle to further progress in elucidating the astrophysics of this t dwarf . the surface gravity can probably be determined from the study of the pressure broadened shape of molecular lines . we have found good evidence for the presence of nh in the spectrum of gl 229b , which was expected from chemical equilibrium calculations . we have been able to determine its abundance at two different levels in the atmosphere , and we find a significant deviation from chemical equilibrium . a similar situation has been found with co previously and this abundance pattern can be explained by vertical mixing in the atmosphere . the extent of the convection zone is not sufficient to account for the abundances we find and the mixing may be due to overshooting or to less efficient eddy diffusion . we find that nh photolysis is not important in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . because nh can be observed in three different bands corresponding to three distinct depths in the atmosphere , an accurate determination of its abundance in each band provides information on the time scale of mixing as a function of depth . this is an unusual and powerful diagnostic tool which can provide valuable clues for modeling the vertical distributions of possible condensates . in principle , any absorber with a large abundance gradient through the visible part of the atmosphere can be used to infer the details of the mixing process . among detected and abundant molecules , only co and nh satisfy this criterion . chemical equilibrium calculations with rainout of condensates show that we can expect significant vertical gradients in the abundances of atomic k , rb , cs , and na as they become bound in molecules ( kcl , rbcl , cscl and nas , respectively ) in the cooler , upper reaches of the atmosphere . cesium and potassium have been detected in the spectrum of gl 229b , and resonance doublets of k i and na i appear to shape the visible spectrum . however , the chemical timescales for alkali metals are so short that they should always remain in thermodynamic equilibrium ( lodders 1999 ) . therefore , they can not serve as probes of vertical mixing in gl 229b . further progress in understanding the atmosphere of gl 229b requires better opacities for ch and nh , and , to a lesser extent , of ho . a more accurate determination of the co abundance from 4 5 m spectroscopy is very desirable and will require higher signal - to - noise spectroscopy than is currently available . similarly , 10 m spectroscopy to determine the nh abundance for bar , while difficult , is important . the issue of vertical mixing and departures from chemical equilibrium gains importance when we consider that the observed departure of co from chemical equilibrium implies a significantly reduced ch abundance , by conservation of the abundance of elemental carbon . similarly , our results imply that nh absorption in the 10 m region is reduced . because ch is a significant absorber in the near infrared , as is nh in the 10 m range , departures from equilibrium must be taken into account when accurate modeling of the atmosphere and spectrum of gl 229b is desired . this new level of complexity compounds the exoticism and the challenges posed by t dwarfs . the astrophysics of gl 229b is far richer than has been originally anticipated . gl 229b is currently the only t dwarf known to be in a binary system . there is no evidence that the illumination from the primary star has a significant effect on the state of its atmosphere and gl 229b is most likely typical of isolated t dwarfs . it remains the brightest and by far the best studied of the seven t dwarfs currently known , but the list should expand to several dozens during the next 2 3 years . the existing body of work on gl 229b points to the most rewarding observations to conduct on t dwarfs . the possibility of studying trends in the physics of t dwarf atmospheres as a function of effective temperature is a fascinating prospect . we thank t. guillot for sharing

{"article": "densely - grafted chains on nonadsorbing substrate surfaces form the so - called `` polymer brush'' . these systems find various important applications , e.g. as lubricants , for colloid stabilization , for tuning of adhesion and wetting properties , for improving the biocompatibility of drugs , as protective coatings preventing protein adsorption ( `` nonfouling '' surfaces ) in a biological milieu , microfluidic chips for biomolecule separation , etc . the theoretical description of the conformations of macromolecules in these polymer brushes and their dynamics has been an active topic of research hitherto ( e.g. , ; for early reviews see . also the interaction of the brushes with either the solvent molecules ( e.g. ) or globular proteins and/or other nanoparticles ( e.g. , ) has found much recent attention . however , in many situations of interest there will also occur free polymer chains in the solution , interacting with the polymers of the brush . this interaction has received relatively less attention , apart from the case where a polymer brush interacts with a dense polymer melt . the latter case is particularly interesting because there is very little interpenetration of the grafted chains in the melt and the free chains in the brush even if their chemical nature is identical ( `` wetting autophobicity '' ) . in contrast , scaling theory , self - consistent field and simulation have predicted partial penetration of free chains into moderately dense brushes of identical chemical nature in semi - dilute solutions when the monomer volume fraction in solution approaches that of the brush , and this behavior has been confirmed experimentally . of course , when the polymer solution is very dilute , the brush provides a free energy barrier for penetration of free chains into it and this limits the grafting density that can be achieved when one prepares a brush by grafting chains from solution ( see also some attempts to model this process by simulations ) . similarly , since typically the energy won by the chain end when it gets grafted is of the order of only , there is a nonzero probability that brush chains get released from the grafting substrate surface and are subsequently expelled from the brush . however , most cases studied so far refer to the situation that ( apart from chain end effects ) the chains in the bulk and those in the solution are identical . it is interesting , therefore , to consider the more general situation when the grafted chains and those in the bulk differ in their chemical nature . then the problem of compatibility ( traditionally modelled by introducing a flory - huggins -parameter ) between the two types of chains arises . then , there is also no reason to assume that the length of the grafted chains , and the length of the free chains are equal . such situations ( in particular , when the grafted and the free chains attract each other , ) are of great interest for modern applications such as protein adsorption , antifouling surfaces , etc . however , to the best of our knowledge , no systematic study of the effects of the various parameters ( and monomer concentration of the free chains ) on the amount of absorption and the penetration kinetics has been reported so far . the present paper presents simulation and density functional theory ( dft ) results in an effort to fill this gap . in section we describe the model and comment on some simulation aspects ; section summarizes our theoretical approach which includes both static and dynamic versions ( ddft ) of dft as well as self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations . the numerical results are described in section while section contains a summary and discussion . at grafting density and free chains of length at equilibrium : ( left ) absorption at , and ( right ) expulsion at . ,title=\"fig : \" ] at grafting density and free chains of length at equilibrium : ( left ) absorption at , and ( right ) expulsion at . ,title=\"fig : \" ] we have used a coarse grained off - lattice bead spring model to describe the polymer chains in our system . as far as for many applications in a biological context rather short grafted chains are used , we restrict ourselves to length of the grafted chains . the polymer brush consists of linear chains of length grafted at one end to a flat structureless surface . the effective bonded interaction is described by the fene ( finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ) potential , \\ ] ] with . thus the equilibrium bond length between nearest neighbor monomers is . here and in what follows we use the maximal extension of the bonds, , as our unit length while the potential strength is measured in units of thermal energy where is the boltzmann constant . the nonbonded interactions between brush and free chain segments are described by the morse potential , -

point for a ( dilute ) solution of polymers described by the model , eqs . - has been estimated as . in all our simulations we use brushes formed by polymer chains consisting of effective monomers whereas the number of free chains of length ( where spans the interval ) is taken such that the total number of free chain segments remains constant and is equal to . for a certain length , however , we also change the concentration of free chains in the container by varying their number in the interval . thus , the volume fraction of -free chains is varied between . note that , as usual , solvent molecules are not explicitly included but work which includes solvent explicitly would yield very similar results . for a dense brush with polymer chains of lengths statistical averages were derived from typically monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per monomer . the monte carlo algorithm consists of attempted moves whereby a monomer is chosen at random and one attempts to displace it to a new randomly chosen position regarding the old position . we use periodic boundary conditions in the directions and impenetrable hard walls in the direction . two typical configurations of the polymer brush with free chains of length , are shown in fig . for the case of good , , and poor , , compatibility with the polymer brush . we employ classical dft to compute density profiles of free and grafted polymer chains . theory has been discussed in detail in previous publications , so here we briefly summarize its most important aspects . the starting point of the dft treatment is the expression for the grand free energy , , as a functional of the density profiles of free and grafted chains , and , respectively ( , where are the positions of the chain segments ) . the functional is related to the helmholtz free energy functional , , via a legendre transform: = f + \\sum {\\alpha = o , p}\\int d{\\textbf}{r} {\\alpha } \\phi {\\alpha}({\\textbf}{r} {\\alpha})v {\\alpha}({\\textbf}{r} {\\alpha } ) , \\ ] ] where is the external field , which in the present case is due to the hard -

field approach , using eqs . ( 12)-(17 ) from ref . ; for the sake of brevity we do not reproduce these equations here . the minimization of the grand free energy functional with respect to yields the equilibrium density distribution for the grafted chains which can be integrated over grafting and bonding delta - functions to obtain the following result for the density profile of the th segment of the grafted chains: where , \\ ] ] with the two propagators in eq .  , and move from the free  and the tethered  ends of the chain , respectively . they are computed via recursive relations given by eqs . ( 23)-(25 ) of ref . . the normalization constant in eq .  is chosen to ensure that the th segment density profile is normalized to . the total segment density profile for the grafted chains is given by : the equilibrium density profile for the segments of the free chains can be obtained in a similar way , by minimizing the grand free energy functional with respect to and integrating over bond - length constraining delta functions . the dft equations described above are solved simultaneously to obtain the segment density profiles for free and grafted chains . the equations are solved iteratively using picard algorithm, with the step size along the coordinate taken to be 0.0325 . the above procedure yields equilibrium segment density profiles for a given set of interaction potentials . in addition to the equilibrium structural properties , we have also studied the kinetics of the adsorption of free chains into the brush , following a switch of the interaction potential between free and grafted segments from repulsive to attractive . to this end , we have employed the ddft method , which is a dynamical generalization of the dft approach. mc simulations have indicated that the segment density profiles of the grafted chains are essentially independent of the strength of the attraction between free and grafted segments . accordingly , in our ddft calculations we take to be time independent and focus on the time dependence of the free chain density , . the time evolution of the segment density profile of free chains is given by the following equation: where is the non - equilibrium local chemical potential , and dimensionless time is defined according to , where is the mobility coefficient . initial density profile corresponds to the equilibrium distribution of free chains at a repulsive brush , i.e. . at , the brush - free polymer attraction is instantaneously `` switched on '' , i.e. we set . the time - dependent polymer density profile is then propagated according to the eq .  , with the time - dependent chemical potential given by : where is obtained by substituting the time - dependent density into the expression for ( and likewise for the propagators and . we solve eq .  using crank - nicholson scheme. note that eq .  has the form of a continuity equation with the flux ( current density ) given by . the fact that the ddft method propagates via a continuity - type equation guarantees the conservation of the total number of segments in the system , which is consistent with the simulation set - up . in order to compare the results of the ddft approach with kinetic mc data , we set the mobility coefficient equal to unity and adjust the conversion factor between ddft dimensionless time and kinetic mc number of steps for one particular set of parameters and . comparisons for all other values of and are performed using the same conversion factor , while assuming to be inversely proportional to both and . with the goal of shedding further light on the thermodynamic aspects of the adsorption process , we have also performed self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations of the structural properties as a function of the interaction strength between the segments of the brush and the free chains ( in scft approach this interaction is characterized by the parameter which is calculated in the standard fashion from the corresponding potential well - depths : ) . the main motivation behind carrying out scft calculations is the fact that this approach provides a more straightforward way to decompose the free energy into entropic and energetic components , thereby providing a complementary ( to dft ) view of the adsorption process . the basic equations of the scft method are well known, and will not be reproduced here for the sake of brevity . once again , the density profiles for free and grafted chains are written in terms of the propagators , the only major difference from the dft approach being that instead of the equation of state , one employs the incompressibility constraint to set up the equations for the density profiles , which are once again solved iteratively using picard s method . for example , the equation for the density profile of the grafted chain segments takes the form : where the normalization constant is obtained from the grafting density , and , with . the hard core potential is independent of the segment type and serves as a lagrange multiplier enforcing the incompressibility condition , meaning that the lattice space is completely filled and no segment overlap occurs . the density profile of the free chain segments is obtained in a similar way . once the profiles are calculated , one can easily obtain excess entropy and energy of the free chains ( relative to pure unmixed components ) as follows : where is the bulk volume fraction of free chains . in fig . we show the density profiles of the free chains , , of length for an attractive , , and a neutral , , brush along with the monomer density profile of the brush itself , . , ( shaded area ) and of free chains , , ( thick lines ) of length , ( given as parameter ) at two grafting densities : ( upper row ) , and ( lower row ) .

fig . c , d . in all graphs one observes pronounced depletion effects at the upper container wall , opposing the brush . however , the inhomogeneity of near the wall at has no effect on in the region of the polymer brush , the flat part of in between the brush and the confining wall at is broad enough to eliminate any finite - size effects associated with the finite linear dimension of the simulation box in direction . one should note also the good agreement between simulation and dft results . in fact , the thin lines , indicating the latter , may hardly be distinguished from the monte carlo data ( thick lines ) in fig . a , b . the only significant discrepancy between theory and simulation is observed in the brush profile in the vicinity of the grafting wall , where dft approach overestimates the oscillations . this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that in the dft method the bond lengths are constraint via delta - functions to a constant value of , while in the simulations the bonds are allowed to vibrate under fene potential , eq .  . for , fig . shows a qualitatively similar behavior of the density profiles for the cases of gradually increasing free chain concentration ( indicated by the number of free chains as parameter ) . expectedly , for ( which corresponds to monomer concentration ) and , the free chains are present in the bulk over the brush as the brush interior is then entirely filled . however , when the brush - free chain attraction increases to , the mc data ( not shown here ) indicate complete absorption of the free chains into the brush with virtually no free chains in the bulk above the polymer brush even at the highest concentration of . with increasing grafting density and/or free chain concentration , the agreement between dft and mc deteriorates somewhat , with the theory underestimating the degree of penetration of free chains into the brush ( see discussion of fig . below ) , which is likely due to the simple tarazona s weighting function employed in our dft calculations . it is well known that at higher densities it would be more appropriate to use weighting functions from the fundamental measure theory. indeed , precisely such approach has been recently used to study adsorption and retention of spherical particles in polymer brushes . with polymerization index of the free chains for two grafting densities . empty symbols denote dft results . the case refers to the critical degree of brush -

dependent density profile ( =24 , left panel ) and flux ( =8 and 32 , right panel ) . in the left panel , one observes two `` ridges '' in at all times a principal ridge , initially located in the bulk above the brush , moves gradually inside , while another ( smaller ) ridge is located near the opposite ( bare ) wall and gradually disappears still moving in the bulk . from the right panel , one can see that for higher concentration ( =32 ) the flux prevails over the lower concentration one inside the brush and at shorter times ( thereby explaining higher initial values of seen in fig . for larger values of ) , while the situation is reversed outside the brush at longer times . the latter behavior is presumably due to higher mobility at lower concentrations and explains the decrease of slope with seen in the inset of fig . . in this work we studied a scarcely explored yet important aspect of oligomer and linear macromolecule absorption in a polymer brush - the case of ( more or less ) good compatibility between species in the bulk and grafted chains . starting from oligomers ( mono- and dimers ) and going up to chain lengths which exceed twice the length of the grafted chains , we have determined the conformation of the absorbed species , the absorbed amount , and absorption kinetics ( the propagation rate into the polymer brush ) at different concentration of the free chains for two cases of moderately to very dense polymer brushes . in addition , by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations , we have substantially broadened the range of lengths of the grafted chains to in order to test more comprehensively our findings . the most salient , and - to some extent - unexpected features of linear chain absorption in a polymer brush that we find are : * the dramatic increase in adsorbed amount with growing chain length , and * the significant slowdown of absorption kinetics with growing concentration ( i.e. , with the increase of the starting gradient in density ) of the free chains besides these static and dynamic properties of polymer absorption in brushes , we find that both the absorbed macromolecules and the brush itself largely retain their structure and conformation , as seen in quantities like and the monomer density profile , for different length and concentration of the free chains , and different strength of attraction to the grafted chains . in particular , the degree to which the brush profile is affected by absorption is found to be much less that anticipated in some earlier theoretical predictions . nontheless , even within these small changes we observe a slight contraction of at small absorbed amounts while gradually attains its extension roughly to that corresponding to zero concentration of free chains with growing . an interesting finding which still needs deeper understanding is the observed existence of a critical compatibility ( i.e. , brush - oligomer attraction ) . at we find both in mc as well as in dft / scft that the energy of all absorbed species has a value independent of their size whereas their entropy experiences a minimum . the critical attraction is manifested by the existence of unique distance from the grafting plane where all monomer density profiles of the free chains intersect . moreover , at the kinetics of free chain absorption into the brush follows a clear cut power law with exponent . undoubtedly , much more work is needed until all these fascinating new features are fully understood . last not least , we emphasize the finding of three distinct regimes in the kinetics of free chain absorption as far as the size of the free chains is concerned . in the first regime the characteristic time for absorption grows rapidly with oligomer length as long as the oligomer size remains smaller than the separation between grafting sites . the second regime is marked by a slower increase of with and ends roughly at . the third regime of absorption kinetics holds for ( i.e. , the penetrating free chain can not accommodate within the brush ) and is characterized by a nearly constant as far as length is concerned . interestingly , this rich kinetic behavior has been experimentally observed in absorption in porous media . one of us , ( a. m. ) , acknowledges support under grant no . bi314/22 . another , ( s. a. e. ) , acknowledges support from the alexander von humboldt foundation , germany . s. alexander , j. physique ( paris ) * 38 * , 983 ( 1977 ) . g . de gennes , macromolecules , * 13 * , 1069 ( 1980 ) . a. m. skvortsov , a. a. gorbunov , i. v. pavlushkov , e. b. zhulina , o. v. borisov , and v. a. pryamitzyn , polym . 30 * , 1706 ( 1988 ) . t. cosgrove , t. heath , b. van lahr , f. leermakers , and j. m. h. scheutjens , macromolecules * 20 * , 1692 ( 1988 ) . s. t. milner , t. a. witten , and m. e. cates , macromolecules * 21 * , 2610 ( 1988 ) . m. muthukumar and j. s. ho , macromolecules * 22 * , 965 ( 1989 ) . m. murat and g. s. grest , macromolecules * 22 * , 4054 ( 1989 ) . p. y. lai and k. binder , j. chem . phys . * 95 * , 9288 ( 1991 ) . s. t. milner , science * 251 * , 905 ( 1991 ) . a. halperin , m. tirrell , and t. p. lodge , adv . sci . * 100 * , 33 ( 1992 ) . i. szleifer and m. a. carignano , adv . chem . phys . * 94 * , 165 ( 1996 ) . j. klein , ann . * 26 * , 581 ( 1996 ) . g. s. grest and m. murat , in monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations in polymer science k. binder , oxford univ . press , new york , 1995 , pp . 476 -

{"article": "systems of interacting open- and closed - strings play important roles in several aspects of string theory . it has been found out that theories even formulated as pure closed - strings have open - string sectors when they are accompanied by d - branes . one of the most important features of such open - closed mixed systems is a duality between open- and closed - strings . this duality becomes manifest , for instance , by seeing one - loop diagrams of open - string as tree propagations of closed - string through modular transformations on the string world - sheets . in the systems of d - branes , this duality should be a rationale for correspondence between gauge theory on the world - volumes ( open - string sector ) and gravity theory in the bulk space - time ( closed - string sector ) . ads / cft correspondence may be regarded as one of the most remarkable examples of such bulk - boundary correspondence . this viewpoint was emphasized also in . nevertheless it becomes very difficult to establish the correspondence between the two . this is essentially because light particles ( ir effects ) in the one sector are realized by summing up whole massive towers ( uv effects ) in the other sector . when a constant field background of closed - string is turned on , however , we expect that the situation could be drastically changed . on this background , the world - volumes of d - branes become non - commutative . low - energy effective theories of the open - string sector , therefore , become field theories on the non - commutative world - volumes . it was pointed out that in such theories there happens a mixing of the uv and the ir . this uv / ir mixing gives us a chance to capture some effects of light particles in the bulk gravity theories , e.g. gravitons , by investigating non - commutative field theories on the world - volumes . to pursue such possibility , non - planar one - loop amplitudes of open - string were studied on this background . higher loops were investigated as well in . coupling of non - commutative d - branes to closed - string in the bulk has attracted much interest particularly from the viewpoint of bulk - boundary correspondence . it was pointed out in that the generalized star - products arise in disk amplitudes consisting of a closed - string vertex operator and open - string vertex ones on a constant field background . the generalized star products are also found to appear in straight open wilson lines by the expansions in powers of non - commutative gauge fields . these observations were combined in and it was shown there that in the zero - slope limit of disk amplitudes of a closed - string tachyon and arbitrary numbers of gauge fields on this background give rise to a straight open wilson line . thus it has been clarified that open wilson lines play a role in the correspondence between the bulk gravity and the non - commutative gauge theories . open wilson lines found in are remarkable gauge invariant objects in non - commutative gauge theories . gauge invariant operators in non - commutative gauge theories can be constructed in the forms of local operators smeared along straight wilson lines . it was also shown in that coupling of closed - string graviton to non - commutative gauge theories actually is an operator of this form . open wilson lines need not be straight in order to be gauge invariant . taking account of the above role played by straight open wilson lines in the bulk - boundary duality , dhar and kitazawa conjectured that curved open wilson lines fluctuating around a straight path should be brought about by higher level ( stringy ) states of closed - string . they showed that the coupling of graviton state is in fact the gauge invariant operator which appears in the leading coefficients in harmonic expansions of curved open wilson lines around a straight path . it is well - known that the so - called boundary states provide a description of d - branes in closed - string theory . open- and closed - strings interact on the branes in space - time . therefore it is further expected that boundary states admit to describe these interactions . in this article , receiving the above development and understanding , we study the system of a d - brane in bosonic string theory on a constant field background . in order to obtain further insight into the bulk - boundary duality , we first exploit the boundary state formalism to include states which describe arbitrary numbers of open - string tachyons and gluons . open - string legs of these boundary states , that is , tachyons and gluons , need not to be on - shell . thereby it becomes possible to study the duality . on a constant field background , boundary state without open - string legs has been constructed in . it is briefly reviewed in the next section . let us denote the state by . this state does not lead any couplings of a closed - string to open - string excitations on the world - volume . we may regard as a perturbative vacuum of closed - string in the presence of the brane . it is also possible to interpret the state as a bogolubov transform of the -invariant vacuum of closed - string : , where is a suitable generator of the transformation . in section we construct boundary states of open - string tachyons . basic idea of the construction may be explained as follows . we first examine an insertion of a closed - string tachyon into the brane . let us suppose that the closed - string world - sheet is an infinite semi - cylinder with and that the brane or the state is located at . we may describe the insertion by , where is a closed - string tachyon vertex operator . however , there occurs a singularity within at the world - sheet boundary . this originates in correlations between the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors which are caused by the brane . we then regularize such a singularity and define a renormalized tachyon vertex operator . it turns out surprisingly that the renormalized operator becomes an open - string tachyon vertex at the boundary . in our prescription of the renormalization , disk green s function and the transform play essential roles . boundary state of a single open - string tachyon is given by . boundary states of arbitrary numbers of open - string tachyons turn out to be realized by the successive insertions of the above renormalized operators . as for boundary states of gluons , they can be obtained by taking the same steps as illustrated above , except that we need to introduce a suitable local operator of closed - string in place of and renormalize it in a suitable fashion . these are presented in section . consistency of the constructions is examined from several aspects at some length . in particular , we compute closed - string tree propagations between these boundary states and make sure that they reproduce the corresponding open - string one - loop amplitudes . these are presented separately in section for the tachyons and in section for the gluons . it is also worth noting that the present constructions are relevant on a vanishing field background . low - energy description of world - volume theories of d - branes is obtained by taking a zero - slope limit so that it makes all perturbative stringy states  of open - string infinitely heavy and decouple from the light states . as regards one - loop amplitudes of open - string , this can be achieved by taking the limit with fixed . here is the proper time on the world - sheet of open - string . the fixed parameter becomes the schwinger parameter of one - loop amplitudes of low - energy effective world - volume theories . it is shown that one - loop amplitudes of open - string tachyons on a constant field background reduce to those of a non - commutative ( tachyonic ) scalar field theory on the world - volume . the above zero - slope limit can be interpreted as magnification of the string amplitudes in the vicinity of . in section we investigate a possible uv behavior of this non - commutative field theory . in order to know the uv behavior one needs to focus on the region . for the description we take the following route . we introduce a parameter , where is the closed - string proper time . and are related to each other through the modular transformation of the world - sheet by . then we take a zero - slope limit with fixed . existence of field allows us to make the limit slightly different from the standard field theory limit of closed - string ( gravity limit ) . this enables us to capture the world - volume theories . this zero - slope limit is magnification of the string amplitudes in the vicinity of and hence the region . strictly speaking , this is a trans - string scale of the world - volume theories . generating function of one - loop amplitudes of open - string tachyons is found out to be factorized at the limit into two ( analogues of ) straight open wilson lines exchanging closed - string tachyons . in general , one - loop amplitudes of open - string are factorized by a tower of closed - string states . in gravity limit the propagations of closed - string tachyons become dominant . although the present limit is slightly different from gravity limit , these zero - slope limits share the common property . uv behavior of the non - commutative gauge theory is explored in section by following the same route . generating function of one - loop amplitudes of gluons is also found out to be factorized at this limit into two straight open wilson lines exchanging closed - string tachyons . these analyses indicate a possibility that field theories on the non - commutative world - volume become topological at such a trans - string scale of the world - volume . the conjecture leads us to expect that curved open wilson lines somehow factorize generating functions of one - loop amplitudes of gluons or open - string tachyons . the standard factorization made by particle states of closed - string seems to be little use . instead , momentum eigenstates of closed - string are used for the factorization . closed - string momentum is a momentum loop ( a loop in the momentum space ) while closed - string coordinate is a space - time loop . section is devoted to introduction of coordinate and momentum eigenstates of closed - string . we also provide some observations on their relations with boundary states . factorizations made by the momentum eigenstates are examined in section for the tachyons and in section for the gluons . it turns out that in the zero - slope limit ( the previous uv limit of the world - volume theories ) momentum loops become curves in the non - commutative world - volume and that open wilson lines along these curves appear in the factorizations . the generating functions are factorized by two curved open wilson lines . more precisely , they become integrals on the space of curves with a gaussian distribution around straight lines . as regards fluctuations from the straight lines , width of the distribution becomes so sharp that the integrals reduce to the previous factorizations by straight open wilson lines . we start section by giving a proof of the conjecture made by dhar and kitazawa . we introduce the closed - string state , where is a momentum loop . this state is not an eigenstate of closed - string momentum but serves as a generating function of ( generally off - shell ) closed - string states . overlap between and boundary states with open - string legs is a generating function of couplings of all the closed - string states to the non - commutative d - brane . the overlap with the boundary states of gluons is shown to become a curved open wilson line in the zero - slope limit . we make an explicit correspondence between the closed - string states and the coefficients of harmonic expansions of the curve . these provide the proof . we also show that in the zero - slope limit the momentum eigenstate is identified with the state after some manipulation . this accounts for the previous factorizations by curved open wilson lines . wilson line is invariant under reparametrizations of the path . the corresponding transformations on the string world - sheet are reparametrizations of the boundary . the reparametrization invariance of boundary states is fulfilled by imposing the ishibashi condition or equivalently the brst invariance on these states . as regards the boundary states of open - string tachyon and gluon it is shown in sections and that their reparametrization invariance is equivalent to the on - shell conditions . on the other hand we do not require any condition on gluons to obtain open wilson lines . this puzzle is solved by seeing that the ishibashi condition or the brst invariance becomes null in the present zero - slope limit . it is observed in section that all the boundary states constructed so far in this article are eigenstates of the closed - string momentum operators . the eigenvalues are essentially delta functions on the world - sheet boundary . their boundary actions are computed by following the prescription given in . it turns out that they are the standard boundary actions used in the path - integral formalism of the world - sheet theory . after a speculation based on these observations we finally make a conjecture on the duality between open- and closed- strings . in appendix world - volume and space - time tensors used in the text are summarized including their relations . in appendix some formulae of creation and annihilation modes are described . these are necessary for our computations of several string amplitudes in the text . oscillator realizations of coordinate and momentum eigenstates are presented in appendix . let us consider the system of d-brane in bosonic string theory . we take the following closed - string background : here is a flat space - time metric , which we refer to as closed - string metric . two - form gauge field is constant . we divide the space - time directions into two pieces , , where and . the directions are supposed to be parallel to the d-brane . the directions are perpendicular to the brane . closed - string may capture the brane . relevant action of a closed - string takes the form : ={4\\pi\\alpha'}\\int {\\sigma } d\\tau d\\sigma \\bigl \\ { \\partial {a}x^{m } \\partial^{a}x^{n}g {mn } -i2\\pi\\alpha ' \\epsilon^{ab}\\partial {a}x^{\\mu } \\partial {b}x^{\\nu}b {\\mu\\nu } \\bigr \\}~ , \\ ] ] where is the antisymmetric tensor on the world - sheet with . the world - sheet is a disk or an infinite semi - cylinder , and we use the cylinder coordinates ( and ) . closed - string interacts with the brane at the boundary of the world - sheet , that is , at . the second term of the action is an integration of the two - form ( its pull - back ) on . since it is an exact two - form , by applying the stokes theorem we can recast it into a boundary integral : = {4\\pi\\alpha'}\\int {\\sigma } d\\tau d\\sigma \\partial {a}x^{m } \\partial^{a}x^{n}g {mn } -{2}\\int {\\partial\\sigma } d\\sigma b {\\mu\\nu}x^{\\mu } \\partial {\\sigma}x^{\\nu}~. \\ ] ] energy - momentum tensor is obtained from the action . since the integration of the two - form is independent of the world - sheet metric , acquires the standard form without the -field . closed - string coordinates have mode expansions of the form , and the standard first quantization requires the following commutation relations : =ig^{mn}~ , \\quad = =0~,\\nonumber\\\\ & & =mg^{mn}\\delta {m+n}~ , \\quad = mg^{mn}\\delta {m+n}~ , \\quad =0~. \\ ] ] the energy - momentum tensor generates reparametrizations of the world - sheet . their infinitesimal forms turn out to be the virasoro algebras with the central charges equal to . the virasoro generators are given by the expansions , and . here we use the complex coordinates instead of the cylinder coordinates . they are related by . and are generators of the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors respectively . these have the following representations in terms of the oscillator modes : where . denotes the standard normal ordering with respect to the -invariant vacuum of closed - string : for and the similar prescription for the anti - chiral modes . the above conditions are used to introduce a boundary state in the first quantized picture of closed - string . let us denote it by . it is a state which satisfies the following conditions : (\\sigma,0 ) = x^{i} {0 } \\ ] ] these are linear constraints on and determine the state modulo its normalization . it turns out that the state satisfies the ishibashi condition as follows : the above state can be interpreted as a perturbative vacuum of closed - string in the presence of the brane . since there are no correlations between string - coordinates of the neumann and the dirichlet directions , we can factorize the state into a product : where the subscripts and denote the corresponding boundary conditions . we may refer to these two states respectively as the neumann and the dirichlet boundary states for short . they satisfy the following constraints : ( \\sigma,0 ) { \\bigl |}b {n } { \\bigr\\rangle}=0~ , \\quad x^{i}(\\sigma,0 ) { \\bigl |}b {d } { \\bigr\\rangle}= x^{i} {0}{\\bigl |}b {d } { \\bigr\\rangle}~. \\ ] ] these constraints may be handled in the oscillator representations . for the neumann boundary state it can be read as follows : where and its transpose are tensors defined as as regards the dirichlet boundary state the constraint can be read as follows : let us describe these boundary states including their normalizations . the above constraints can be solved without any difficulty in the oscillator representations . determinations of their normalization factors need to be cared . we start with the dirichlet boundary state . the dirichlet boundary state turns out to be given by where we put . the state is an eigenstate of the zero modes with eigenvalues . momentum representation of is given by where denotes an eigenstate of the momentum zero modes with eigenvalues defined as the dual state can be obtained by taking the bpz conjugation : it is easy to see that the state  satisfies the conditions  . since they are linear conditions , normalization factor of the state should be determined by other means . we fixed it to be in the above . it is determined by claiming that closed - string propagations along the dirichlet directions reproduce the vacuum one - loop amplitude of open - string which satisfies the dirichlet - dirichlet ( d - d ) boundary conditions . we parametrize propagations of closed - string by . closed - string evolves by an imaginary time with the hamiltonian . see figure . .,height=264 ] closed - string propagations along the dirichlet directions are measured by , where we put . this amplitude can be easily calculated by using the formula in appendix . it turns out to be where with . contribution of the world - sheet reparametrization ghosts is excluded in eq. . it will be included in string propagations along the neumann directions . the corresponding amplitude of open - string is given by . open - string propagates by an imaginary time with the hamiltonian . see figure . . two bold horizontal lines are identified.,height=264 ] the trace is taken over the sector of open - string which satisfies the d - d boundary conditions . the amplitude becomes as follows : the standard argument allows us to interpret these open - string amplitudes as the free propagations of closed - string . two imaginary times are related with each other by . this leads us to write eq. as where the modular transformation is used . a comparison between eqs. and  gives the identity : therefore the propagations of closed - string reproduce correctly the corresponding one - loop amplitude of open - string except the factor . this factor turns out to be canceled by a similar one appearing in closed - string propagations along the neumann directions . the neumann boundary state is given by where is a tensor defined by the dual state is obtained by the bpz conjugation . its explicit form is as follows : the above normalization factor of the state is chosen to reproduce the related one - loop amplitudes of open - string . this will be shown in the next section . as can be seen in eqs. and  these boundary states are the bogolubov transforms of perturbative vacua . generators of the transformations are for the dirichlet boundary and for the neumann boundary . we can expect that information on the boundary conditions are all encoded in these generators . let be a local operator of closed - string . action of this operator on a boundary state , where is a generator , can be written as follows : describes the bogolubov transform of this local operator and ask the physical implication particularly from the viewpoint of boundary conformal field theories . however , story is not so simple . in general , turns out to be singular . more precisely it becomes singular at , where the boundary state resides . this reflects the fact that the system under consideration is actually a system of closed- and open - strings . we wish to make an idea of the bogolubov transformations of these local operators rigorous . for this purpose , we have to perform a regularization by which the above singularity becomes tractable . this leads us to define , which becomes regular at the world - sheet boundary . it is a local operator and interpreted as the adjoint transform of by . we will find out their physical interpretation . in this section we concentrate on tachyon vertex operators . since we are mainly interested in the world - volume theory of -brane , we restrict ourselves to the bogolubov transform associated with the neumann boundary state . we denote the generator by , let be closed - string tachyon vertex operator of momentum . momentum is supposed to have only components along the neumann directions . an explicit form is given by \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~~ \\times \\prod {n=1}^{\\infty } \\exp \\left . \\ ] ] to discuss the bogolubov transform it is convenient to write down the transforms of oscillator modes of the string coordinates . these can be read as : for . the modes and for are kept intact . ( we put . ) the above mixture of the creation- and annihilation - modes makes the transform singular at or equivalently , since we put , at . it can be written in the following form for : here we introduce a local operator which we interpret as the bogolubov transform of . it takes the form of where and are operators consisting only of the creation modes : singularity of comes from the factor in eq. . because of this factor , the transform  becomes singular at where the boundary state is located . as will be seen soon , this factor should be subtracted in our construction of open - string tachyon vertex operator from a closed - string local operator . this factor can therefore be regarded as a renormalization factor of open - string tachyon vertex operator under its interpretation in terms of closed - string . putting this factor aside for a while , let us examine the operators . we first discuss their operator product expansion ( ope ) . it is convenient to recall the ope between closed - string tachyon vertex operators . it can be read from the expansion  as follows : for and . the ope under consideration changes from eq. . the modification comes from operator products between , and . it can be calculated by using the expansions  . we finally obtain : for and . here is green s function on the unit disk in the presence of a constant field . it is defined by the rhs can be evaluated by using the bogolubov transforms  and written down explicitly as follows : let us recall that a system only of closed - strings admits a holomorphic factorization . particularly there is no correlation between chiral and anti - chiral pieces , and , of string coordinates . the factorized term of in eq. is a sum of the correlations and . the second and third terms are not factorized and they are respectively the correlations and . these correlations are characteristic of open - string theory . green s function provides a nice description of the singular factor in eq. . using this terminology we can write it as follows : where the first equality follows from eq. and . taking account of this expression , the transform  indicates that boundary states give rise to extra correlations , i.e. correlations between the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors , by the amount of . in the presence of the world - sheet boundary , or equivalently in the open - closed mixed system , correlations between the chiral and anti - chiral sectors exist even in the closed string sector , and we need to take care of them . as pointed out in , this is a direct result of the fact that boundary states on the unit circle reflect a vertex operator at making its mirror image at : ( see also ) . this brings about a short distance singularity at the boundary . since we intend to construct open - string vertex operators in terms of closed - string , we need to carry out a renormalization to manage this type of singularity . the ope  itself strongly suggests an interpretation of from the open - string viewpoint . to pursue such a possibility we introduce a renormalized tachyon vertex operator by subtracting the above singular factor : in other words we have we call renormalized open - string tachyon vertex operator with momentum . the action  is completely the same as the action of the virasoro algebra on open - string tachyon vertex operator with the same momentum . in addition to the ope  this is the reason why we identify with renormalized open - string tachyon vertex operators . we can also make the above consideration in terms of boundary states . let us consider the state . by using the relation  we can write it in a form , . an explicit form of has been given in eq. . thereby we can express the state in the oscillator representation and then take the limit without ambiguity . we call thus obtained state . it turns out to have the following form : g {n}|k \\rangle . \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ] ] here we express the normalization factor of in terms of the open - string tensors . this translation is done by using the identity , , which also follows from eq. . action of on this state can be obtained from eq. . it can be read as for . the ishibashi condition imposed on , i.e. vanishing of the rhs of the above equation for an arbitrary , ( strictly speaking , modulo a total derivative with respect to ) , requires . it is the on - shell condition of open - string tachyon . the action of on the boundary state has an interpretation in terms of string field theory . fundamental ingredient in string field theory is a brst charge . it is a grassmann - odd operator obeying the usual relations , and , where and are respectively total energy - momentum tensor and anti - ghost field of a world - sheet theory . in the case of bosonic closed - string field theory world - sheet theory consists of closed - string coordinates ( a matter system ) and the world - sheet reparametrization ghosts . the ghost system is described by for the chiral part and for the anti - chiral part . closed - string brst charge is decomposed into . the chiral part has the following form : where are the virasoro generators of the matter and the ghost systems . and are the fourier modes of ghost and anti - ghost fields : and . the anti - chiral part has the same form as the above except replacing the chiral quantities with the anti - chiral ones . these and are nilpotent independently and satisfy the relations , and . here and are the virasoro generators of the total system . let and be respectively the hilbert spaces of matter and ghost systems . we put . closed - string hilbert space consists of vectors of which satisfy the conditions , necessity of the two conditions is explained in from the perspective of two - dimensional conformal field theories . now we want to interpret the state as a state of the closed - string hilbert space . since it is a boundary state of the neumann directions we first extend it to a vector of by tensoring the boundary state  of the dirichlet directions . as for the ghost sector an appropriate state is known . it is given by and satisfies the following boundary conditions : for . it can be seen from these conditions that satisfies the ishibashi condition . further tensoring the ghost boundary state we obtain of . we call it . this state satisfies the first condition in eq. because of eq. . as for the second , the case of eq. gives . this means that we need to integrate over to regard the state as a vector of . the above action can be identified with the brst transformation of open - string tachyon vertex operator . in eq. correspond to the same modes of ghost field appearing in open - string field theory . actually eq. is an example of the formula given in . it states that the closed - string brst charge acts on boundary states as the generator of the brst transformation of open - string field . it is used there to show a macroscopic description of the cubic open - string field theory is given by a boundary open - string field theory . we wish to interpret these states as boundary states with off - shell open - string tachyons . this is verified by comparing closed - string tree propagations between these states with the corresponding open - string one - loop amplitudes and testing their coincidence . these will be done in the next subsection . it is worth mentioning that the present construction is also applicable in a vanishing field background and in particular the boundary states  become available just by putting . to describe the closed - string propagations we need the dual boundary states . although they are given by the bpz conjugation , we apply the previous formalism to their construction as well in order to gain some insight into them . instead of we use the bpz dual : the transform of tachyon vertex operator is given by . it can be written in the following form for : here we introduce a local operator , which we interpret as the ( dual ) bogolubov transform of . it takes the form of where and are operators consisting only of the annihilation modes : singularity of comes from in eq .  . it becomes the same as the singular factor appearing in eq. after changing the coordinate to . similar calculation to what is made to obtain eq. leads to the ope : for and . here is green s function on the unit disk . it is defined by and written down explicitly as follows : similarly to eq. , the singular factor appearing in eq. is expressed as the self - contraction of between its chiral and anti - chiral parts . this may be seen as follows . let be the chiral anti - chiral correlation of green s function : . using this quantity , we can write the singular factor as dual of the renormalized open - string tachyon operator , which we call , is given by subtracting the singular factor appearing in eq. as follows : we remark that the action on the dual vertex operator reduces to eq. after we take the limit . let us describe the dual boundary state . it is obtained by following the same route as taken for eq. . let  be the dual vertex operators . let be distinct points on the infinite semi - cylinder satisfying the condition , . we consider the state and take the limit . thus obtained state , which we call , is the dual . explicitly it is given by . \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ] ] the hamiltonian operator of closed - string is . we can conveniently parametrize propagations of closed - string by . the evolution by an imaginary time is given by the operator , where we put . in this subsection we only consider the propagations along the neumann directions . propagations of closed - string between the boundary states  are measured by the following amplitudes : \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ] ] further evaluations of the infinite products are carried out in appendix . we just quote the result obtained there . the contributions from the massive modes turn out to be as follows : ^{2\\alpha'k {\\mu}^{(r)}g {\\mu \\nu}k {\\nu}^{(s ) } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~~ \\times \\prod {m+1 \\leq r < s \\leq m+n } \\left ^{2\\alpha'k {\\mu}^{(r)}g {\\mu \\nu}k {\\nu}^{(s ) } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~~ \\times \\prod {r=1}^m \\prod {s = m+1}^{m+n } \\left ^{2\\alpha'k {\\mu}^{(r)}g {\\mu \\nu}k {\\nu}^{(s)}}. \\nonumber \\\\ \\ ] ] for the comparison with open - string one - loop calculation it is convenient to write down the amplitudes  by using the elliptic -functions . appropriate -functions are . they have the following representations : where we put . the amplitudes  , combined with closed - string propagations along the dirichlet directions , should be compared with open - string tachyon one - loop amplitudes . we begin this subsection with a brief exposition on the open - string calculation in a constant field background of closed - string . related with a prescription of normal orderings relative to the -invariant vacuum of open - string , it is convenient to introduce commutative zero - modes instead of the non - commutative ones . they satisfy the standard canonical relations ; = =0 ] . in what follows we adopt the standard normal ordering of . it is also denoted by . the virasoro generators can be obtained from the energy - momentum tensor by . they turn out to have the following forms : where we put . among these generators open - string propagator is given by . evolution of open - string on the upper half - plane is described by due to an integral representation . it is useful to observe the open - string coordinates , particularly , at the boundary of the world - sheet . we may use the radial coordinates , where , as a parametrization of the upper half - plane . they can be read as follows : at both boundaries and , effect of the non - commutativity of the world - volume ( the -dependence ) is encoded only in the zero modes while the massive part acquires the standard mode expansion . open - string amplitudes are correlation functions between local operators inserted at the boundaries . it follows from eq. that -dependence of local operators such as tachyon- and gluon - vertices are encoded only in their zero modes . one - loop amplitudes can be obtained in the operator formalism simply by taking a trace of these operators with the propagators inserting among them . the integral representation of the propagator may be used . the zero mode dependent part decouples from the others in . therefore , for the particular cases of tachyons and gluons , only the zero - modes of open - string are influenced by the non - commutativity of the world - volume . let us consider one - loop amplitudes of tachyon vertex operators . we introduce open - string tachyon vertex operator of momentum by we consider the scattering process of tachyons with momenta . it is worth noting that the momenta have only components along the neumann directions . it is because the propagation of open - string is restricted along the d - brane world - volume . diagram describing the one - loop scattering process can be drawn on the upper half - plane as depicted in figure . an open - string evolves along the radial direction from the outer semi - circle to the inner one and interacts with the tachyon vertices at its ends . two semi - circles are identified with each other and thereby the diagrams is interpreted as an open - string one - loop . the corresponding tachyon amplitude , which we call , is given by a sum of traces of their products arranged in cyclically distinct orders with keeping their partial cyclic orderings at the both ends : we can evaluate the amplitude in the standard manner . let us recall that the tachyon vertex operator enjoys the properties : combined with the integral form of , this enables us to write the amplitude as follows : the coordinates , which appear in the rhs as insertion points of the tachyon vertices , can be thought to provide a parametrization of the diagram . another parametrization may be obtained by mapping the diagram to a cylinder with width . see figure . two bold vertical lines are identified with each other.,height=529 ] correspondingly are mapped to by . we put . we may use instead of . the evolution of open - string becomes manifest in this parameterization . in the figure an open - string with width evolves along the real axis from the origin to , interacting with the tachyon vertices inserted at or . to compare the open - string one - loop amplitude  with eq. we map the cylinder drawn on the -plane ( figure ) to a cylinder with width on the -plane by the conformal transformation . see figure . two bold vertical lines are identified with each other.,height=529 ] are mapped to by . we put . these provide a new parametrization of the diagram , which makes an evolution of closed - string manifest . a closed - string with circumference evolves along the imaginary axis , starting from the real axis where it interacts with open - string tachyons and ending on where it interacts with open - string tachyons . we note that the insertion point of the -th open - string tachyon is fixed at . low - energy description of world - volume theories of -brane can be obtained by taking a zero - slope limit so that it makes all perturbative stringy states  of open - string infinitely heavy and decouple from the light states . low - energy effective theory relevant to open - string tachyons in the presence of a constant field is a scalar field theory on the non - commutative world - volume . in general , quantum field theories on a non - commutative space suffer the uv - ir mixing which originates in the non - commutativity . it causes a serious problem on the renormalization prescription of these theories . in this section , based on the results obtained so far , we investigate the uv behavior of the non - commutative scalar field theory . for this sake it is convenient to start with a brief description of the above zero - slope limit of the one - loop amplitudes of tachyons . our study in this section is restricted to the case of -brane in the critical dimensions . eq. can be identified with one - loop amplitude of open - string tachyon ( a scalar particle of ) living on the non - commutative world - volume . it is the amplitude obtained from the corresponding one - loop feynman diagram consisting of trivalent vertices . each of the vertices represents the following cubic interaction : here we introduce the moyal product ( an associative non - commutative product ) by the feynman rule becomes a little complicated due to the above moyal products . but the feynman integral can be evaluated by using the standard technique and translated to eq. . we can find in the integral of eq. . the first term comes from the schwinger representation of the tachyon propagator , . this is the standard term which appears in ordinary field theory one - loop amplitudes . the second term can be understood as a uv regularization ( a regularization of the integration near ) . it is a curious regularization since it depends on the external momentum , . this feature can be thought of as a characteristic of quantum field theories on a non - commutative space and makes field theoretical description of physics at high energy scale difficult . it should be also noted that integrations in eq. have potential singularities at  . these singularities can be already seen in the integral  . although we do not describe their regularization here , prescription used for the cubic open - string field theory will be effective . both parameters and are regarded as coordinates of the moduli space of conformal classes of cylinder with punctures at the boundaries . for each values of the closed - string parameters we obtain a graph as depicted in figure . set of these graphs is the above moduli space . strictly speaking , these graphs are representatives of the conformal classes and thus it is possible to make different choices . for each values of the open - string parameters we obtain a graph as depicted in figure . it can be identified in the standard manner with a metrized trivalent one - loop ribbon graph . metric of the graph is given by the open - string parameters . these metrized ribbon graphs can be chosen as the representatives . therefore the open - string parameters give another set of coordinates of the moduli space . the above moduli space has several ends . typically we have two ends at and . the previous zero - slope limit of open - string is related with the end at the infinity as can be seen from eq. . actual procedure to obtain the zero - slope limit  shows that the field theory amplitude is a suitable magnification of the integral  on an infinitesimal neighbourhood around this end . we want to know the uv behavior of the world - volume theory . for such a purpose we need to focus on the region . one possible resolution may be obtained by taking a zero - slope limit such that it magnifies an infinitesimal neighbourhood around another end located at . near this end use of the closed - string parameters will be effective as the open - string parameters near the infinity . let us examine a zero - slope limit which will be taken by fixing the following parameters : in the course of taking the limit we also fix open - string tensors and in order to capture the world - volume theory . it follows from eq. that this makes the limit different from the standard field theory limit of closed - string . transformation between the open- and the closed - string parameters leads and . for and to remain finite the original field theory parameters need to satisfy and . we can not neglect effects of all the perturbative stringy states of open - string at such a trans - string scale . hence the limit in question includes their effects . it is important to compare the above zero - slope limit with the previous one . in eq. the schwinger propagator is integrated and gives rise to the propagator of closed - string tachyon of momentum , while the counterpart in eq. consists of two parts one of which is standard in field theories and the other is a curious regularization factor originated in the non - commutativity . the factors ^{k {\\mu}^{(r)}g^{\\mu \\nu}k {\\nu}^{(s ) } } ] . we have two expressions of the action ,  and  . they provide two momentum currents , which coincide for the dirichlet directions but become slightly different from each other for the neumann directions . when the action  is used one obtains while the action  leads to their conserved charges become the same , that is , momentum , since these are integrals of the currents over the circle . whichever momentum current one adopts as the conjugate variable of , canonical quantization of closed - string leads to the same commutation relations  . let be closed - string coordinate operators . they are simply given by . the conjugate momentum operators are those operators satisfying =0 ] and ] . its origin in string theory can be found in eq. . the interaction simply comes from the closed - string tachyon modes of boundary states , . actually these boundary states have all the components of perturbative closed - string states . at the level of string amplitudes all of them propagate between the boundary states and contribute to the amplitudes . it is shown in that the straight open wilson line can couple with the on - shell graviton and , as will be seen in the later section , it can be generalized to the off - shell . this indicates that all the perturbative closed - string states have tadpole interactions with the open wilson line . therefore we may unfasten the zero - slope limit  so that propagations of all these states are made manifest . in this section we pursue such a possibility . we also restrict to the case of -brane in the critical dimensions . let us provide a general perspective on this issue before we start calculations . first of all , it can be expected that closed - string propagations including gravitons fluctuate the straight line appearing in eq. and transform it into curved ones . in other words we can expect that there are correlations between their deviations from the straight line and the propagations of closed - string states . these curves will appear as the corresponding wilson lines , and we may factorize the generating function into a sum of these products at the zero - slope limit . analogously to the standard factorization of closed - string amplitudes the sum must be taken originally over the perturbative closed - string states . the above correspondence between curves and states will enable us to translate the sum as an integral over the space of curves . this integral may be suppressed by a suitable weight as the straight line is suppressed in eq. by the closed - string tachyon propagator . it is amazing that one can interpret the tachyon propagator as a propagator of the straight open wilson line by notifying . the factorization  may be obtained from the aforementioned integral by integrating out the fluctuations . we may say that the straight open wilson line is the average . in order to justify the above perspective let us first factorize the string amplitudes by an insertion of a partition of unity . use of that constructed from closed - string momentum eigenstates turns out to be relevant . it is given in eq. as ~ \\langle p n | , ] . ^{2\\alpha'k {\\mu}^{(r)}g^{\\mu \\nu}k {\\nu}^{(s ) } } \\times \\prod {m+1 \\leq r < s \\leq m+n } the above factorization may be compared with the previous expression of the amplitudes . terms in the first four lines can be found exactly in eq. . the other terms describe a factorization of in the same equation . if we integrate out and they provide eq. . these variables describe fluctuations of . corresponding degrees of freedom of closed - string are given by the massive modes . the factorization of in terms of those complex variables are plausible since is the sum of contributions of these massive modes . we examine the zero - slope limit of the factorization  . the limit we discuss is same as that investigated previously to capture the uv behavior of the world - volume theory . it is taken by fixing parameters and besides the open - string tensors . we also keep and intact . they do not scale under the limit . it should be noticed that the complex variables used originally to parametrize do scale under the limit . this is because and in  are the rescaled ones introduced by multiplying the original variables by . we first focus on the integral over and in eq. . let us start by considering the first exponential in the integral . scaling part in the exponent is expressed by means of the closed - string tensors and . it has the form : dominant contribution at the limit clearly comes from the first term : where we use equalities  . we turn to the determinant factors , which is also described by the closed - string tensors . their contributions can be read as follows : \\approx \\left ( {2\\pi } \\right)^{26 } \\left.\\ ] ] the other two exponentials in the integral have similar forms . it is enough to know the behavior of in their exponents . it can be read by using eq. as follows : as we studied previously , contributions of the first four lines in the factorization  are to give rise to the straight open wilson lines . the last pieces we need to estimate are the exponentials whose exponents are bilinear of with the weights , . it is enough to know the behavior of these weights . again using eqs .  and  it can be read as . thus we can neglect these pieces in the zero - slope limit . the integration of are suppressed exponentially compared with . it can be accomplished by replacing the integration variables with their mean values and becomes unity at the zero - slope limit . then the above factorization reduces to that by the straight open wilson lines . our study of gauge theory starts from this section . an analogue of gluon vertex operator of open - string is introduced in closed - string theory . investigation of its bogolubov transformation leads a renormalization of this operator . it will be shown that the renormalized operator enjoys the standard properties of ( open - string ) gluon vertex operator , including the action of the virasoro algebra . these operators , acting on the neumann boundary state , give rise to boundary states which turn out to be identified with the boundary states of ( open - string ) off - shell gluons . in particular we will show that closed - string tree amplitudes between these states coincide with the corresponding gluon one - loop amplitudes of open - string . our discussion in this section goes almost parallel to section where the boundary states of off - shell open - string tachyons are constructed . in closed - string theory an analogue of gluon - vertex operator may be taken as where -vectors and are the momentum and the polarization vectors . the polarization vector is the fourier transform of gauge field : the gauge field takes value in . this yields . while we concentrate on gauge group in this paper , it can be straightforwardly generalized to by assigning the chan - paton indices . let us express the above operator in an auxiliary form . this often makes subsequent calculation facile . let be an auxiliary parameter . we write the operator in an exponential form : with \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\times \\prod {n=1}^{\\infty } \\exp \\left~.\\ ] ] the relation  implies that the terms proportional to higher powers of become irrelevant to the amplitudes . we consider the bogolubov transformation for generated by given in eq. . using  we can write down the transform as follows : where ~. \\ ] ] the operator is defined to be where and consist of the creation modes alone and take the forms of in the transform  we can find the same singularity structure as that of the tachyon . it is due to the factor , which is responsible for the singularity of the transform  at the world - sheet boundary , . this factor contains an exponential in addition to the same factor which appeared in the transform . let us make a few comments about this extra factor . the first term of the exponent is proportional to . the closed - string tensor used there is translated into . the second term becomes irrelevant since it is proportional to . therefore the net effect of this extra factor is to give a term proportional to . particularly in the absence of a constant field , reduces to that of the tachyon . the singular factor which appears in the transform of the tachyon vertex operator has been expressed in eq. as the self - contraction between the chiral and the anti - chiral parts of . in the present case as well , we can think of the singular factor as such a self - contraction of . in fact , we can express by using the chiral anti - chiral correlation of green s function as follows : ~. \\ ] ] as mentioned in the analysis of tachyon , boundary states induce correlations between the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors , and this feature is characteristic of systems of interacting closed- and open - strings . we wish to find out a relation between and open - string gluon vertex operators . previous discussions to establish the relation between and open - string tachyon vertex operators consist of : i ) description of the ope between , which turns out to be given in  by using green s function and allows us to introduce the renormalized open - string tachyon vertex operators , ii ) description of the diff action on , which turns out to reduce at the boundary to the standard virasoro action on open - string tachyon vertex operators , and iii ) reproduction of open - string one - loop tachyon amplitudes by the boundary state formalism . we repeat these analyses as for gluons in the following . let us examine the ope between . it is convenient to start with the ope between the auxiliary operators . the standard calculation leads to \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\ ; \\times : { {a}}\\left(\\sigma {1},\\tau {1};k^{(1)};a {1}\\right ) { {a}}\\left(\\sigma {2},\\tau {2};k^{(2)};a {2}\\right):~,\\ ] ] for and . since have the form given in  , we can obtain their ope from the above by taking account of the opes between and . we find that \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\ ; \\times : {g {n}^{-1 } } { {a}}\\left(\\sigma {1},\\tau {1};k^{(1)};a {1 } \\right)\\ ; {g {n}^{-1 } } { {a}}\\left(\\sigma {2},\\tau {2};k^{(2)};a {2 } \\right ) : ~ , \\ ] ] for , and . this is a direct extension of the tachyon case  and suggests an interpretation of in terms of the gluon vertex operator . let us introduce the renormalized operator by the following subtraction : in other words , in addition to the subtraction of the singular factor , a finite subtraction is made in the above by the multiplication of . although it vanishes in the absence of field , this factor becomes surely necessary in general . without this subtraction we can not reproduce even the standard virasoro action which we present below . the renormalized operator  gives rise to by the relation  . we refer to as renormalized gluon vertex operator with momentum and polarization . it can be written as follows : where is the closed - string tachyon vertex operator . next we will examine the action of diff on the above renormalized operators . as a shortcut we use the description in terms of boundary states . relevant states are introduced as ; a;(\\sigma , k)\\bigr\\rangle ] . the first states are defined by using as follows : ;a ; ( \\sigma , k ) \\bigr\\rangle \\equiv \\lim {\\tau\\rightarrow 0 + } { {a}}^{ren } ( \\sigma,\\tau;k;a ) \\left| b {n } \\right\\rangle } \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\left ( \\right)^{2 } } { \\left(2\\alpha'\\right)^{p+1}(-\\det g {\\mu\\nu } ) } \\right)^{{4 } } \\lim {\\tau\\rightarrow 0 + } g {n } \\left(g {n}^{-1}{ {a}}^{ren}(\\sigma,\\tau;k;a ) g {n}\\right ) |\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\left ( } { \\left(2\\alpha'\\right)^{p+1 } } \\right)^{{4 } } e^{{2\\pi } aa {\\mu}(k)\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}k {\\nu}}\\,g {n } \\lim {\\tau\\rightarrow 0 + } {g^{-1} {n}}{ {a}}(\\sigma,\\tau;k;a ) |\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\left ( } { \\left(2\\alpha'\\right)^{p+1 } } \\right)^{{4 } } e^{{2\\pi}aa {\\mu}(k)\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}k {\\nu } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\prod {n=1}^{\\infty } \\exp \\left g {n } |k {n}\\rangle~ , \\ ] ] where eqs. and  are utilized to obtain the oscillator representation . the second states are defined similarly by using as ; ( \\sigma , k ) \\bigr\\rangle & \\equiv & \\lim {\\tau\\rightarrow 0 + } { v {a}}^{ren } ( \\sigma,\\tau;k ) \\left| b {n } \\right\\rangle i {\\partial a } \\bigl| {n};a ; ( \\sigma , k ) \\bigr\\rangle \\right| {a=0}~.\\ ] ] the oscillator representation can be obtained from  . this yields ; ( \\sigma , k)\\bigr\\rangle = \\left . i {\\partial a } \\bigl| {n} ; a ; ( \\sigma , k)\\bigr\\rangle \\right| {a=0 } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\left\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times { \\bigl |}b {n } ; ( \\sigma , k){\\bigr\\rangle}~ , \\ ] ] where is the boundary state with a single open -

ordered exponential becomes vague without a prescription . namely we need to regularize the path - ordered integral . relevant regularization in place of the above normal - ordering will be discretization of the boundary circle . in such a regularization scheme the eigenvalues are regarded as sums of delta functions on the original boundary circle . this leads us to the conjecture : momentum eigenstates of closed - string have expansions by means of boundary states with open - string legs . finally we would like to mention some related issues . as we carried out to a certain extent in this paper , our boundary states enable us to perform off - shell calculations . this suggests that these states can be used in a covariant formulation of a field theory of interacting open- and closed - strings . string field theory that has prediction power for the open - closed mixed systems has been required also in our understanding of unstable -branes and tachyon condensations associated with them . it seems probable that boundary states with open - string legs constructed here are generalized to vertex functions between open- and closed -

{"article": "in the last years wireless communication systems coped with the problem of delivering reliable information while granting high throughput . this problem has often been faced resorting to channel codes able to correct errors even at low signal to noise ratios . as pointed out in table i in , several standards for wireless communications adopt binary or double binary turbo codes and exploit their excellent error correction capability . however , due to the high computational complexity required to decode turbo codes , optimized architectures ( e.g. , ) have been usually employed . moreover , several works addressed the parallelization of turbo decoder architectures to achieve higher throughput . in particular , many works concentrate on avoiding , or reducing , the collision phenomenon that arises with parallel architectures ( e.g. ) . although throughput and area have been the dominant metrics driving the optimization of turbo decoders , recently , the need for flexible systems able to support different operative modes , or even different standards , has changed the perspective . in particular , the so called software defined radio ( sdr ) paradigm made flexibility a fundamental property of future receivers , which will be requested to support a wide range of heterogeneous standards . some recent works ( e.g. , , ) deal with the implementation of application - specific instruction - set processor ( asip ) architectures for turbo decoders . in order to obtain architectures that achieve both high throughput and flexibility multi - asip is an effective solution . thus , together with flexible and high throughput processing elements , a multi - asip architecture must feature also a flexible and high throughput interconnection backbone . to that purpose , the network - on - chip ( noc ) approach has been proposed to interconnect processing elements in turbo decoder architectures designed to support multiple standards , , , , , . in addition , noc based turbo decoder architectures have the intrinsic feature of adaptively reducing the communication bandwidth by the inhibition of unnecessary extrinsic information exchange . this can be obtained by exploiting bit - level reliability - based criteria where unnecessary iterations for reliable bits are avoided . in , , ring , chordal ring and random graph topologies are investigated whereas in previous works are extended to mesh and toroidal topologies . furthermore , in butterfly and benes topologies are studied , and in binary de - bruijn topologies are considered . however , none of these works presents a unified framework to design a noc based turbo decoder , showing possible complexity / performance trade - offs . this work aims at filling this gap and provides two novel contributions in the area of flexible turbo decoders : i ) a comprehensive study of noc based turbo decoders , conducted by means of a dedicated noc simulator ; ii ) a list of obtained results , showing the complexity / performance trade - offs offered by different topologies , routing algorithms , node and asip architectures . the paper is structured as follows : in section the requirements and characteristics of a parallel turbo decoder architecture are analyzed , whereas in section noc based approach is introduced . section summarizes the topologies considered in previous works and introduces generalized de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies as promising solutions for noc based turbo decoder architectures . in section three main routing algorithms are introduced , whereas in section the turbo noc framework is described . section describes the architecture of the different routing algorithms considered in this work , section presents the experimental results and section draws some conclusions . a parallel turbo decoder can be modeled as processing elements that need to read from and write to memories . each processing element , often referred to as soft - in - soft - out ( siso ) module , performs the bcjr algorithm , whereas the memories are used for exchanging the extrinsic information among the sisos . the decoding process is iterative and usually each siso performs sequentially the bcjr algorithm for the two constituent codes used at the encoder side ; for further details on the siso module the reader can refer to . as a consequence , each iteration is made of two half iterations referred to as interleaving and de - interleaving . during one half iteration the extrinsic information produced by siso at time  is sent to the memory at the location , where and are functions of and derived from the permutation law ( or interleaver ) employed at the encoder side . thus , the time required to complete the decoding is directly related to the number of clock cycles necessary to complete a half iteration . without loss of generality , we can express the number of cycles required to complete a half iteration  as where is the total number of trellis steps in a data frame , is the number of trellis steps processed by each siso , is the siso output rate , namely the number of trellis steps processed by a siso in a clock cycle , and is the interconnection structure latency . thus , the decoder throughput expressed as the number of decoded bits over the time required to complete the decoding process is where is the clock frequency , is the number of iterations , for binary codes and for double binary codes . when the interconnection structure latency is negligible with respect to the number of cycles required by the siso , we obtain thus , to achieve a target throughput and satisfactory error rate performance , a proper number of iterations should be used . the minimum  to satisfy with iterations can be estimated from  for some asip architectures available in the literature . if we consider , as in , , ranges in to achieve mb / s ( see table ) . it is worth pointing out that the values in table represent the average numbers of cycles required by the siso to update the soft information of one bit ( see table vi in and table i in ) . moreover , strongly depends on the internal architecture of the siso and in general tends to increase with the code complexity . as a consequence , several conditions can further increase , namely 1 ) interconnection structures with larger ; 2 ) higher values ; 3 ) higher ; 4 ) higher ; 5 ) lower clock frequency . thus , we consider as relevant for investigation a slightly wider range for : . .parallelism degree required to obtain mb / s for with some asip architectures available in the literature the area and the percentage are not really zero , but they are negligible compared with the i m and lm contribution to the total area . the most important conclusions that can be derived from results in table and are : 1 . the asp - ft routing algorithm is the best performing solution both in terms of throughput and area when . 2 . the routing memory overhead of the asp - ft algorithm ( see fig . ( b ) ) becomes relevant as decreases and ssp solutions become the best solutions mainly for and . 3 . in most cases topologies with =4 achieve higher throughput with lower complexity overhead than topologies with =2 when . 4 . in most cases , generalized de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies are the best performing topologies . as a significant example , in fig . , we show the experimental results obtained with and asp - ft routing algorithm for the wimax interleaver with ( a ) and the circular shifting interleaver with ( b ) . each point represents the throughtput and the area obtained for a certain topology with a certain parallelism degree . results referred to the same value are bounded into the same box and a label is assigned to each point to highlight the corresponding topology , namely topologies are identified as r - ring , h - honeycomb , t - toroidal mesh , k - generalized kautz with the corresponding value ( k2 , k3 , k4 ) . as it can be observed , generalized kautz topologies with ( k4 ) are always the best solutions to achieve high throughput with minimum area overhead . in fig . significant results extracted from table and are shown in graphical form . in particular , for the asp - ft routing algorithm is the best solution , whereas for ssp routing algorithms , implemented as in fig . ( c ) , tend to achieve the same performance as the asp - ft routing algorithm with lower complexity overhead ( see fig . ( a ) and ( b ) for the wimax interleaver , and fig . ( c ) and ( d ) for the circular shifting interleaver , ) . an interesting phenomenon that arises increasing the interleaver size is the performance saturation that can be observed in the table for topologies , namely the throughput tends to saturate and increasing has the effect of augmenting the area with a negligible increase or even with a decrease of throughput . as an example , the generalized kautz topology with and asp - ft routing algorithm achieves more than 180 mb / s with , , . however , the solution with the smallest area is the one obtained with . the throughput flattening of low topologies can be explained by observing that high values of tend to saturate the network . furthermore , high values of lengthen the input fifos as highlighted in table , where the total area of the network is given as the breakdown of the building blocks , namely the input fifos , the crossbars ( cb ) , the output registers , the routing algorithm / memory ( ra / m ) , the identifier memory ( i m ) and the location memory ( lm ) is given for some significant cases : the highest throughput ( light - gray ) , the highest area ( mid - gray ) , and lowest area ( dark - gray ) points for each value in table . in this work a general framework to design network on chip based turbo decoder architectures has been presented . the proposed framework can be adapted to explore different topologies , degrees of parallelism , message injection rates and routing algorithms . experimental results show that generalized de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies achieve high throughput with a limited complexity overhead . moreover , depending on the target throughput requirements different parallelism degrees , message injection rates and routing algorithms can be used to minimize the network area overhead . a. giulietti , l. v. der perre , and m. strum , `` parallel turbo coding interleavers : avoiding collisions in accesses to storage elements , '' iet electronics letters , vol . 38 , no . 5 , pp . 232234 , feb 2002 . m. j. thul , f. gilbert , and n. wehn , `` optimized concurrent interleaving architecture for high - throughput turbodecoding , '' in ieee international conference on electronics , circuits and systems , 2002 , pp . 10991102 . c. neeb , m. j. thul , and n. wehn , `` network - on - chip - centric approach to interleaving in high throughput channel decoders , '' in ieee international symposium on circuits and systems , 2005 , pp . 17661769 . h. moussa , o. muller , a. baghdadi , and m. .jezequel , `` butterfly and benes - based on - chip communication networks for multiprocessor turbo decoding , '' in design , automation and test in europe conference and exhibition , 2007 , pp . 654659 . s. benedetto , d. divsalar , g. montorsi , and f. pollara , `` soft - input soft - output modules for the construction and distributed iterative decoding of code networks , '' european transactions on telecommunications , vol . 9 , no . 2 , pp . 155172 , mar / apr 1998 . o. muller , a. baghdadi , and m. jezequel , `` asip - based multiprocessor soc design for simple and double binary turbo decoding , '' in design , automation and test in europe conference and exhibition , 2006 , pp . 13301335 . o. muller , a. baghdadi , and m. jezequel , `` exploring parallel processing levels for convolutional turbo decoding , '' in ieee international conference on information and communication technologies : from theory to applications , 2006 , pp .", "summary": "this work proposes a general framework for the design and simulation of network on chip based turbo decoder architectures . several parameters in the design space are investigated , namely the network topology , the parallelism degree , the rate at which messages are sent by processing nodes over the network and the routing strategy . the main results of this analysis are : i ) the most suited topologies to achieve high throughput with a limited complexity overhead are generalized de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies ; ii ) depending on the throughput requirements different parallelism degrees , message injection rates and routing algorithms can be used to minimize the network area overhead ."}
